            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Oedema</note> For although in the account of latter Phyſitians, yea, and in <hi>Galen</hi>'s time alſo, ſuch tumors as were ſoft, and though roughly handled were yet altogether void of pain, theſe only were ſaid to be <hi>Oedema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> which the Ancients with an addition called <hi>Oedemata Malthaca,</hi> and <hi>Anodyna,</hi> that is, ſoft and painleſs Swellings: Yet this word <hi>Oede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> with <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and the more ancient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians ſignifieth in general all, and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular preternatural Tumor; as is obſerved by <hi>Galen</hi> in the 1. Prognoſt. text 29. in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon B. 4. of the Aphoriſms, Aph. 34. on the fift of the Aphoriſms, Aphor. 65, 66. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where very frequently. Somtimes alſo by a general name they cal it <hi>Phyma,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phyma.</note> and then generally it ſignifies every Tumor that of its own accord, and without any external cauſe breaks forth, eſpecially into ſome one or other outward part of the body; even as a Plant ſhoots out of the Earth: the truth of this will ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſult <hi>Galen</hi> in the ſixth of his Epidemicks, Comment. 1. text. 23. In the Books of the more modern Latines, theirs eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally whom they uſually ſtile barbarous, or illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, al ſorts of whatſoever Tumors are comprized under the name of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem: nay more,<note place="margin">Tumors whether rightly called Apoſtems</note> among theſe latter Phyſitians there want not ſome, who haply ignorant enough of the Greek Tongue, make bold to write that all thoſe are very much miſtaken who aſſign any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the name of a <hi>Tumor</hi> and an <hi>Apoſtem:</hi> which Magiſterial Cenſure of theirs notwithſtanding claſhes both with the Authority of all the more ancient Phyſitians, and the propriety of the Greek Tongue.<note place="margin">Apoſtem, what it is</note> for the Greek Phyſitians wil have only that Tumor or Swelling which is come to a ſuppuration, to be called an <hi>Apoſtem,</hi> as after in the third Chapter ſhal be ſhewn; and by the Latines this Tumor is termed <hi>Abſceſſus</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica;</hi> but by the more Modern and ignorant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors it is rendered <hi>Exitura,</hi> from a word taken out of the Interpreter of <hi>Avicen.</hi> But now, all Swellings (or Tumors) come not to a ſuppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as for inſtance, that which we commonly call <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> or St. Anthonies fire, <hi>Herpes,</hi> and oftentimes <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> which is an unnatural Swelling hot and red, and of ſuch like Tumors divers others.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this confuſion and promiſcuous uſe of names to be charged upon the Arabians, but
<pb n="2402" facs="tcp:49110:5"/> upon the illiterate Interpreters of them, who have unskilfully tendered the Arabian words by ſuch as are very unfit and improper. For the Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans altogether as exactly as the Grecians have made a diſtinction in name betwixt Tumors and Apoſtems; calling Tumors by a general name <hi>Bothor,</hi> but an Apoſtem they termed <hi>Dubellet</hi> and <hi>Dubellatum.</hi> And therefore for the due and proper ſignification of each word, the Authors that have written in the ſame, and not in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Language are to be conſulted; that is to ſay, as <hi>Galen</hi> in his ſmal Tract to <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the art of preſerving the health relate to Phyſick) in the thirty ſecond Chapter tels us; if it be a word of the Aſſyrian Tongue, we muſt for the right underſtanding of it have recourſe to thoſe who were the Authors thereof; or if it be a word in the Perſian, Indian, Arabian, or Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Language, or any other Tongue, we muſt accordingly apply our ſelves to ſuch as are skilful therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Tumor</note>Now then, what a Tumor may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be, we wil here make an exact inquiry, with thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> proviſo, of which the Reader is deſired to take notice, that our chief and main drift is here to treat of ſuch Tumors as are beſides Natures intention, and may therefore be juſtly ranked among the ſeveral kinds of Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or Diſeaſes. Now therefore every ſwelling or augmentation of a part beyond its natural ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit may not be reputed a preternatural Tumor. For although ſome men that are fat and groſs grow to a breadth and thickneſs beyond their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural habit; yet notwithſtanding, whenas hereby there is not the leaſt hurt or detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any one action cauſed in them (in which caſe only ſomthing is ſaid to be preternaturally affected) theſe may not be ſaid to have in them any thing that is beſide the intent of Nature,<note place="margin">Every Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is not a Diſeaſe</note> or preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but only ſomthing that is not Natural, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that which is according to Nature, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith. For there is this middle conſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe bodies that are in al points according to Nature, and thoſe that have in them ſomwhat that is preternatural, or beſides Natures intention, as the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> gives us to underſtand in his Book of this ſort of Tumors, in the firſt Chapter thereof. So then, albeit haply the growth of ſome one part may be extended beyond its natural habit, yet ſo that this notwithſtanding its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may not be impeded, and that there be not the leaſt ſenſe of pain accompanying it; in this caſe we ſay, that ſuch like Tumor or Swelling is nor beſides Nature, neither as yet is it to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Diſeaſe, but rather a ſymptom. And hence it is alſo that <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Tumors, entitles it, not of Tumors ſimply ſo called, but of Tumors preternatural. And much leſs reaſon is there that the Breaſts of Nurſes when they are diſtended with the abundance of milk, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon are wont to appear far greater than in tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> that give not ſuck; and likewiſe in child bearing Women that the lower belly though exceedingly dilated in ſuch eſpecially who are neer their time of Delivery, ſhould be ſaid to be affected with a Diſeaſe; in regard that theſe things happen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe and Laws of Nature.</p>
                  <p>But what a Tumor is,<note place="margin">A Tumor what it is</note> and unto what kind of Diſeaſe it belongs, is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo manifeſt. For many and differing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions hereof we find given by ſeveral Authors, which here particularly to recite is not requiſite, nor worth the while; and <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf ſeems now and then to thwart himſelf, and not alwaies to be of one and the ſame judgment in giving us the definitions of this Tumor we are now trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of. For in his thirteenth Book, and firſt Chapter, of the Method of Phyſick, he tels us that a Tumor is a Diſeaſe wherein the parts have rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from their natural habit and quantity. And in his firſt Book of the cauſes of Symptoms, and the ſecond Chapter, he refers Tumors unto orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes; for there he writes, that <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones</hi> or Inflammations, <hi>Scirrhos</hi> or hard Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the Skin, <hi>Abſceſſus,</hi> i. e. Impoſtumes or Ulcers, and other affects of this nature are to be accounted Diſeaſes of the parts inſtrumental. But in his Book of the difference of Diſeaſes, Chap. 13. and of the Cauſes of Diſeaſes, Chap. 6. he reckons up Tumors among the diſtempers ariſing from the firſt qualities, and the diſeaſes of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milary parts. The Phyſitians likewiſe that have written ſince his time differ in their Opinions. <hi>Fallopius</hi> adheres to <hi>Galen</hi>'s Opinion in his 13. Book, Chap. 1. of the Method of Phyſick, before mentioned, and refers Tumors unto thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes we cal inſtrumental, to wit, when there is a preternatural magnitude or augmentation. <hi>Hieronymus Capivaccius</hi> (in the Chapter where he writes concerning a Phrenſie) tels us, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tumor muſt needs be a diſeaſe in the <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> or diſtemper proceeding from the firſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; and that there is no neceſſity why it ſhould be accounted an Affect ariſing from an ill conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: which Opinion of <hi>Capivaccius</hi> is aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto by <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius ab aquapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente.</hi> But others there are, among whom <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtachius Rudius</hi> is one, who aſſert that a Tumor is an evil compounded of magnitude augmented, and a diſtemper alwaies accompanying it as its concomitant; and that the augmentation of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude with this <hi>intemperies,</hi> or diſtemper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding (as before ſaid) from the firſt qualities, is the formal cauſe of every tumor; and <hi>Rudius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines that thoſe tumors only which are cauſed in the parts by reaſon of a preternatural afflux of matter, are Tumors properly ſo called; but that the Tumors happening in disjoyntings or diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the falling down of the Inteſtines into the Cods, and in the Tumor <hi>Aneuriſma,</hi> are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo to be accounted.</p>
                  <pb n="2403" facs="tcp:49110:5"/>
                  <p>But if we exactly weigh this Controverſie, and withal accurately ſift out the ſignification of the word <hi>Tumor,</hi> and <hi>Onchus;</hi> and likewiſe if we wil heedfully inquire into the eſſence of a Swelling, as it may be conſidered in it ſelf, we muſt then with <hi>Galen</hi> rightly define a Tumor under the notion of a ſwelling;<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Tumor</note> that it is an affect or diſeaſe in the which the parts of our body recede from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate by an augmentation of their magnitude. For the word <hi>Onchus</hi> with the Grecians ſounds as much as the diſtance of the parts, to wit, by reaſon of their being extended in magnitude, breadth, and profundity; as is obſerved by <hi>Galen</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his Book of Humors: ſo that it may juſtly be reputed a grand abſurdity in the definition of a Tumor, to aſſert that it is this or that, and in the mean time to omit the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of magnitude; this being all one as to affirm that a Tumor may be without a Tumor, that is to ſay, a Swelling. For although it be a truth (which erewhile we hinted, and that which <hi>Galen</hi> likewiſe obſerves in his Book of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Diſeaſes, the twelfth Chapter) that a Tumor if it be not ſuch, and ſo great that thereby any hurt and detriment ſhal accrue to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber affected in any one of its operations, is not properly a diſeaſe, but a ſymptom; and that that preternatural Affect ought to be defined rather by the <hi>intemperies</hi> or diſtemper that accompanies it, and very much annoyes the actions, then by the ſwelling, which in no wiſe impedes or offends them: Yet notwithſtanding it wil not therefore follow, that a Tumor alſo which is a diſeaſe, and which doth indeed ſo greatly hurt and hinder the operations, is to be defined rather by the <hi>dyſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> and <hi>intemperies,</hi> than by the augmentation of magnitude. And the truth is, that very frequently Tumors when they have their original either from a fleſhy, or from a boney and hard ſubſtance, or laſtly from a flatulent Spirit, which is not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally either hot or cold, are altogether free from an <hi>intemperies,</hi> or, as we commonly term it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. In the mean time notwithſtanding we deny not but that other diſeaſes that are no way eſſential to a Tumor may yet be joyned with and accompany this augmented magnitude which doth altogether conſtitute and make up the eſſence thereof. For if the matter cauſing the Tumors exceed in heat, cold, drineſs, or moiſture, it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with derives this diſtemper unto the part affected; inſomuch that hence it comes to paſs that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe alſo then concurs, and is concomitant with the <hi>intemperies</hi> or diſtemper. Moreover, if the ſame matter ſhal either by corroding or diſtending any part diſunite what before was cloſe and compact, then there immediately happens that which we call the ſolution of Unity. Somtimes alſo it comes to paſs that the figure and ſhape of ſome part is altogether marr'd, or at leaſt very much vitiated; and ſomtimes likewiſe the Cavities, Pipes, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are either compreſſed, or at leaſtwiſe very much obſtructed through the abundant afflux of matter: the which accidents very frequently (if not for the moſt part) concurring with a Tumor, hence it is alſo that in the difference and cure of Tumors, we handle not only the augmented quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, but likewiſe even al thoſe other concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Diſeaſes. Mean while it ſtands good for an undeniable truth, That a Tumor as ſuch, that is, a Swelling, is an affect or diſeaſe in the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude augmented beyond Natures intention, and hath its production from ſomwhat that is preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and comes to be adjoyned to ſome one or other part. Nor is it of any validity what <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> here objects, That in Tumors which have their original from the humors, and thoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe which have for their cauſes the ſtrutting forth and falling down of parts, and ſuch like, that there the difference is to be taken from the efficient, next, and containing cauſe, and that from this cauſe we may gain excellent, artificial, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Indications; but not ſo from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of magnitude augmented. For albeit they differ in the containing ſpecial cauſe, that this is now and then an humor, ſomtimes above, and ſomtimes alſo an Inteſtine or Gut fallen down; yet in the general cauſe they agree, which is ſome one thing or other preternatural added unto the part, and ſwelling it up into a Tumor. And in every Tumor (as it is likewiſe in al other diſeaſes depending upon the cauſe containing) no profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Indicacion can be gained, or may be expected from this cauſe, no not in thoſe Tumors which have their dependance upon the influx of humors. For the general Indication (though it be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeleſs) is this, that the humor which lifteth up the part into a tumor is to be removed; but how and by what means this may be effected, is wholly left unto the skil of the knowing Artiſt. In the mean time I wil not deny but that thoſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which have their original from the humors may fitly enough be ranked among the diſeaſes that are compounded of augmented magnitude, diſtemper ariſing from the afflux of matter, and a vitiated figure; yet however this is not to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in al Tumors. And hence it is (without doubt) that <hi>Galen</hi> hath placed the Tumors one while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the Affects of the ſimilary parts, as in the twelfth Chapter of the difference of Diſeaſes; and aſſoon again among thoſe Diſeaſes we call or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical, and this he doth in the thirteenth of his Method, and firſt Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it to be denied, That now and then Authors whilſt they make mention of preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tumors do not intend al Tumors in general, ſuch as are alſo thoſe that are produced by the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of the bowels, or by ſome boney ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſticking out; but thoſe in ſpecial which are cauſed by the afflux of humors; and theſe are evermore diſeaſes that may properly be ſaid to be compounded of magnitude augmented, <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
                     <pb n="2404" facs="tcp:49110:6"/> an unmeet figure, and moſt uſually alſo the ſolution of Unity.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</note>Now the matter which we ſay is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded being threefold, to wit, a Humor, a Wind, and a ſolid Subſtance; the primary Difference then of Tumors ought to be taken from that which we commonly term the Containing Cauſe. Tumors then are ſomtimes thus differenced, that ſome are great, others not ſo; ſome external, ſome internal; ſome new, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are of longer ſtanding. But theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are meerly accidental, denoting a certain mutation or change, and an alteration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but the <hi>ſpecies</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> kinds they vary not in the leaſt. But the differences ſpecifical, and which conſtitute the ſeveral kinds, are taken from the matter and the containing Cauſe, which is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, as hath been ſaid. Firſt of al therefore Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors derive their very being from the humors; but theſe as yet have not obtained any peculiar appellations to be called by, but at leaſtwiſe are al of them comprehended under the general name of a Swelling; yea, as ſome ſay, they are only called <hi>Tumors.</hi> Secondly, Winds it ſhut up in any part diſtend the ſame, and lift it up into a Swelling or Tumor; and this ſort of Tumors the Grecians cal <hi>Emphyſemata,</hi> the Latines <hi>Inflatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> by reaſon of their windy original. In the third place, now and then ſomwhat reſembling fleſh, or skin, or that is hard and ſolid as a bone, and other ſuch like matter is ſuper-added unto ſome one part, and there cauſeth a Tumor or Swelling: But in regard that theſe very ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have their original from the humors, we will thereupon adjoyn this ſort of Tumors unto the firſt kind. And laſtly, even the very ſolid parts of the body themſelves cauſe Tumors whenas they change their place, together with their ſcituation, and ſlip down upon ſome other part, which they both diſtend and elevate: neither have theſe any peculiar names to be known by. There are yet ſome other differences behind. From the quality of the concomitant matter, ſome are ſaid to be hot, others cold; ſome moiſt, others dry; ſome ſoft and looſe, others hard. From their magnitude, the greater of them are by a general name ſimply called Tumors, the leſs <hi>Tubercula.</hi> From their ſcituation, that ſome are internal, others external; and theſe again either more deep and profound, or elſe ſuperficial. From their figure, ſome of them are ſaid to be broad, others again ſharp-pointed. But now to comprehend al thoſe differences of Tumors under names, and to give you the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, is not very eaſie to do. <hi>Galen</hi> in the cloſe of his Book of Tumors writes, That there was not any one kind of theſe preternatural Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which there he had omitted, but that he had ſpoken of them all, and had not left any one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. And out of that Book <hi>Johannes Philippus Ingraſſias</hi> (in his Book of tumors, firſt Tract, firſt Chapter, and ſecond Commentary, pag. 77) hath collected Sixty one Tumors, which he reckons up in this order: 1. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulentia.</hi> 2. <hi>Phlegmone.</hi>

                  <p>But that Entities ſhould be multiplied in this manner without any cauſe is altogether unfitting. For, as al the affects which are here reckoned up under the name of Tumors are not properly to be accounted Tumors; beſides that one and the ſame Tumor is ſomtimes repeated under different names: So again, <hi>Ingraſſias</hi> having not at this time compleated the remaining Sections of his Works concerning Tumors, it is not ſufficiently apparent what Tumors he would have us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand under ſome of theſe names. Now for the truth of this, that I may give you an inſtance or two of what hath been ſaid; he reckons up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Tumors, <hi>Sinus</hi> and <hi>Fiſtula, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcus Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronium,</hi> and divers other Ulcers. But before or ſince <hi>Ingraſſias,</hi> who hath there ever been that hath taken the liberty, or made ſo bold to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate among the Tumors that are properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſuch as are theſe following, viz. <hi>Lethargus, Typhomania, Catochus, Catalepſis, Carus, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexia, Lordoſis, Coeliaca affectio, Colica, Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus hepaticus, Splenicus,</hi> and other ſuch like Affects, which relate either to Symptoms, or the kinds of other Diſeaſes, rather than unto Tumors. And in very truth many of the Tumors wherewith this Catalogue is ſtuft, are not peculiar kinds of Tumors, but only differences of their ſpecies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the parts affected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Tumors, their Differences.</note>Now therefore we conceive that there are two main Differences e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to be heeded in Tumors; one whereof ariſeth from the variety of Cauſes, and the other is by reaſon of the parts affected. We have ſaid before, that the conteining cauſe of a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is threefold, a Humor, a Wind, and a ſolid Subſtance. Again, the humors are various &amp; much different, to wit, Blood, Phlegm, Melancholy, a black humor, a wateriſh and wheyiſh humor, and divers other thin excrements; as alſo mixt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and matter into which other humors degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and likewiſe malignant humors.</p>
                  <p>From the Blood there is cauſed an extraordinary Corpulency (which the Greeks call <hi>Polyſarcia</hi>) and an Inflammation.<note place="margin">Their Cauſe containing:</note> There are likewiſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="2406" facs="tcp:49110:7"/> a Gangrene &amp; a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> unto an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in regard that an Inflammation ſomtimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into them. But becauſe that a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene and <hi>Sphacelus</hi> do very often proceed from other cauſes without an Inflammation, and have not alwaies a Tumor to accompany them, and are of neerer alliance unto Ulcers, very uſually dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating into them; we wil therefore treat further of them anon when we come to ſpeak of Ulcers. But with more right it is that unto an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we refer an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> or <hi>Roſa</hi> (as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly termed) <hi>Bubo, Furunculus, Phyma, Phygethlon, Parotis, Carbunculus, Paronychia, Perni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nes, Ecchymoſis;</hi> as afterward from the ſpecial Explication of theſe Affects wil further appear.</p>
                  <p>From Choler is produced <hi>Herpes,</hi> and its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
                  <p>From the Pituitous or Phlegmy humor proceeds <hi>Oedema.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Melancholly humor, <hi>Scirrhus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From black Choler, <hi>Cancer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the watry humor, <hi>Hydrocephalus, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia aquoſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But of the wheyie humor, and the thin excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious matter called <hi>Ichores,</hi> from which vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous leſs ſwellings by the Latines called <hi>Tubercula</hi> do ariſe, there is a very vaſt difference: and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes theſe ferous and wheyie humors, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſalt and cholerick humors are mingled with other, and from hence originally proceed divers Wheals or Puſhes in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>Moreover from the humors there is derived alſo a certain peculiar kind of tumors, yet nevertheleſs differing from thoſe we have hitherto made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of in a twofold reſpect. The former diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence lies in this, that it proceeds not from one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle humor, but from more, to wit, Phlegm, I mean ſuch as hath other humors, Melancholly or Choler mixt therewith; yet notwithſtanding ſo, that the cauſe conjunct may not any longer be ſaid to be an humor, but ſome other matter generated from out of thoſe humors. The later difference con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that the aforeſaid matter is included in ſome one peculiar Membrane. Tumors of this ſort are, <hi>Strumae,</hi> and <hi>Scrofulae, Bronchocele, Ganglia, Nodi, Melicerides, Atheromata, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atomata, Teſtudo, Talpa,</hi> and <hi>Natta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of the humors likewiſe (where you are to underſtand ſuch humors that degenerate into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter) take their riſe and original thoſe tumors which the intelligent Artiſt cals, <hi>Polypus, Pamela ſub lingua, bernia carnoſa, Verrucae, Fungi,</hi> and others the like. There are moreover tumors that have their very being from malignant humors; and theſe are <hi>Variolae, Morbili, Lepra,</hi> as the Arabians, or <hi>Elephantiaſis,</hi> as the Greeks name it, Tumors Venereal of different kinds, <hi>Bubones,</hi> and peſtilential Carbuncles.</p>
                  <p>From flatulency or windineſs are derived <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſemata</hi> as the Grecian Authors, or <hi>Inflationes,</hi> as the Latines call them, and all other flatulent tumors whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>From the ſolid parts lying out of their proper places ariſe <hi>Hernia</hi> in the Cods and Navel, when the Inteſtines fal down thither; <hi>Epiplocele.</hi> And hitherto alſo is to be reduced <hi>Aneuriſma,</hi> a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor that hath its original from an Arterie dilated, as in like manner <hi>Varix,</hi> being a tumor from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Vein.</p>

                  <p>THat kind of Tumors which is cauſed by the Humors is found to be moſt frequent and uſual; and therefore we wil treat of it in the firſt place. The primary and nigheſt cauſe hereof is a humor elevating and raiſing up a part beyond Natures intention unto a greatneſs more than is ordinary. Which ſaid humor having for the moſt part a certain exceſs of qualities adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>Now of the humors that cauſe theſe Tumors there is great diverſity. For both the Natural and preternatural humors, whoſe differences we have already ſpoken to in their proper place, excite Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; &amp; hereunto belongs the matter that is whey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey and wateriſh, filth and corrupt matter, and all things elſe into which the humors degenerate, and which are to be found in Tumors, and yet are not in the number of the parts of the Body; of which there is great variety. <hi>Galen</hi> in his ſecond Book to <hi>Glauco,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The variety of ſuch things as are often found in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtems.</note> and ſeventh Chapter, writes, that in Apoſtems there have been found to be ſubſtances conteined like unto Stones, Sand, Shels, Wood, Mud or Slime, the filth of Baths, the dregs and lees of Oyl, together with many other ſuch like reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And in his fourteenth Book of the Method of Phyſick, and twelfth Chapter, he further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that in Tumors have been diſcovered ſubſtances reſembling Nails, Hairs, Bones, Shels, and Stones. And that Worms alſo may be found in Tumors frequent experience teſtifieth; <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopius</hi> with others have ſeen ſuch Tumors; and I my ſelf have more than once beheld the like. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus Remigius</hi> in his third Book of the worſhip of Devils, and firſt Chapter writes, that with his own Eyes he beheld while they took out of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume ful of filth, and opened in the Calf of a Mands Leg, a certain round ſubſtance or Globe, ſuch as is to be ſeen in Weavers Shops. And <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus</hi> in his Book of the Devils impoſtures Chap. 13. relates that in the inciſion of an Impoſtume on the left ſide of a certain G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>, above the Spleen, there was taken forth an Iron Knife, and after it there iſſued out abundance of filth and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The like whereunto <hi>Langius</hi> alſo hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in his firſt Book, and thirty eighth Epiſtle. Now if any ſuch ſtrange thing chance to happen, the Vulgar People are wont to aſcribe it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the Sorceries, Spels, and Charms of their Deviliſh Neighbors. But there is no neceſſity, why for all things that are evacuated out of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes beſides purulent matter, we ſhould by and by have recourſe to ſuch Cauſes as theſe, or rank them among the ſupernatural Cauſes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, ſeeing that many of theſe contingents may be generated out of the humors erewhile rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For whenas Experience makes it manifeſt, that in moſt parts of mans Body ſmal Stones, Sand and Gravel, Hairs, or ſuch like, and alſo divers kinds of Worms may be produced out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humors; and that likewiſe (not only in the Body of man) ſtrange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful kinds of Worms and other little Animals; may be bred out of the Corruption of others, it ſhould not ſeem any great wonder, that the matter in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors (eſpecially if it be naught, and hath been long there ſhut up and deteined) doth admit of thoſe various and ſtrange mutations, happening by means of its rottenneſs and putrefaction. But yet notwithſtanding, if ſuch things be found in Impoſtumes that are come to a ſuppuration, and likewiſe in Tumors, which cannot be generated in mans Body by nature, or at leaſtwiſe by Natures ſtrength alone without the concurrence of Art, (ſuch as are all things formed of Metals, Bodkins, Knives, Iron Nayls, and the like) then indeed they cannot be referred unto natural cauſes; but may upon more than probable Grounds be imputed unto the Impoſtures, ſubtilty, and power of the Devil. But as for the manner how ſuch things may be either generated in the Body, or covertly conveyed into it, is not my purpoſe here to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. I therefore proceed to diſpatch what I have further to deliver touching the reſt of the cauſes of Tumors that take their riſe and original from the humors.</p>
                     <p>So then,<note place="margin">Tumors, how cauſed by congeſtion or the heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of humors.</note> as for what concerns the cauſes remote; be they what they will for their kind, they may eaſily be known, if we do but enquire into the manner how Tumors come to have their firſt being; and withal take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from whence, and after what ſort, or by what means that humor which hath rightly gained to be ſtiled the containing Cauſe, comes into the part affected. Now therefore that humor which is the nigheſt and containing Cauſe of a Tumor is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſenſibly and by degrees heaped up in the part, or elſe altogether as in a heap (which the Grecians expreſs by the word <hi>Athroos</hi>) flow into it. The matter is gradually, and by little and
<pb n="2408" facs="tcp:49110:8"/> little gathered together in the part affected, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and moſt eſpecially, by reaſon of ſomwhat amiſs in the member, to wit, when either the concoctive power is grown weak, and therefore cannot as it ſhould digeſt the nutriment, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates more excrements than it ought to do; or elſe when the expulſive faculty doth not caſt out all the excrements as it ought to do; and this may come to paſs either through its own weakneſs, or otherwiſe becauſe the way by which thoſe excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be ejected is not ſufficiently open. And again, a humor is likewiſe then heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the parts, whenas the food it ſelf is naught and unwholſom; for hence it happens that either ſo great abundance of excrements are cauſed that the expulſive faculty cannot caſt them al forth, or elſe that they are ſo thick that Nature cannot eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expel them. But upon what cauſes theſe cauſes do depend hath been already declared in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place; nor is it requiſite that we ſhould at large repeat what hath been ſpoken. Only in a few words take this; That the weakneſs of the faculties wholly depends upon the <hi>intemperies</hi> or diſtemper of the parts, and the decay of their native heat. The paſſages are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by overmuch and thick matter, which happens to be condenſed by the vehemency of cold. Meats of an ill juyce produce ſtore of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements: Now what theſe meats are, <hi>Galen</hi> gives us to underſtand, in his Book touching meats of a good and evil juyce.</p>
                     <p>A Humor then flows to ſome part (this being in truth the more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual cauſe of Tumors) when either it is drawn by that ſame part,<note place="margin">tumors, how cauſed by an afflux. How by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</note> or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto it from ſome other place. Attraction primarily proceeds from heat cauſed either by overmuch motion, or from the heat of the Sun and Sun-beams, from the fire; or laſtly from any ſharp Medicine taken in. For the parts ſo ſoon as they are heated by theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes draw unto themſelves humors from the reſt of the body, although there be not therein any exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſtore of humors; and yet I deny not but that the more the body abounds with humors, the greater is the ſtore of them that is attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Pain likewiſe frequently enough excites Tumors, by attracting the humors unto the part aggrieved. Yet we ſay not that pain of it ſelf draws the humors, but that this is done by ſome other means; and commonly it is ſaid to draw, for theſe three cauſes. Firſt, becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture while ſhe attempts to relieve the ſuffering part ſends in an extraordinary ſupply of blood and ſpirits to the part in pain, and this ſhe doth with an endeavor more than uſual; ſo that by this means ſhe over fills, and hurts the parts ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſuccour. Secondly, the grieved part by this time grows hot from that abundance of blood and ſpirits tranſmitted thither by Nature; and hereupon fals to drawing more than before, by reaſon of this adventitious heat. And laſtly, pain weakens the Members. Now the Members once weakned, if they attract not, yet they readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and in the leaſt reſiſt not the matter flowing in upon them from ſeveral parts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A Tumor is cauſed by a defluxion, when as the humors are tranſmitted unto ſome part, although they be not drawn by that part. For whereas there is in every part a faculty not only of attracting al things familiar and agreeable unto it, but alſo of expelling and caſting out whatever is ſuperfluous and burdenſom; hence it is that being ſtir'd up and provoked by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs or offenſive quality of the excrements and humors it expels and thruſts forth unto ſome other part whatever is uſeleſs, or at leaſt burdenſom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Where if it be not digeſted or evacuated by tranſpiration, it is thence again forced unto ſome other parts until at length it come unto the weakeſt, which is not able to expel theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted humors; ſo that being here left they cauſe a Tumor. For it cannot be that a Tumor ſhould be cauſed by the matter tranſmitted and ſent from divers places, unleſs we grant (as needs we muſt) that there is a part which ſends them, a part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, and the paſſages by which the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors flow. The parts do then tranſmit when the vigorous faculty by the quality or ſtore of matter is incited to expulſion. For unleſs the faculty were provoked, it would never attemp this expulſion; and unleſs it were ſtrong and vigorous, it could never effect it. And this is likewiſe much furthered by the external cauſes exciting the fluxion, to wit, Heat, which attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates and diſſolves the humors; and cold, that by conſtriction preſſeth the parts together, and thereby cauſeth the greater afflux of the ſaid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, unto theſe two may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo a third cauſe of the defluxion, and that is a certain (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or) violent iſſuing forth of the humor it ſelf, as uſually it doth appear in perſons that have the Dropſie, where we find a water through its own weightineſs deſcending into the Feet and Cods; which motion notwithſtanding is wont to ceaſe in the night time; but this would not be if the humor were expelled by Nature; and not rather (as in truth it is) forced down by its own gravity.</p>
                     <p>Now as for the humors flowing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from elſwhere,<note place="margin">the parts receiving</note> they are received by ſuch parts as are feeble, and through their weakneſs altogether diſpoſed for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a fluxion. For evermore the more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Members ſend away that which is ſuperfluous unto the weaker. The weaker Members we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſuch as either have contracted a certain debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their very firſt formation, or being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hurt do contract unto themſelves a kind of preternatural conſtitution; or elſe they are ſuch
<pb n="2409" facs="tcp:49110:8"/> as Nature her ſelf makes and intends for weak, and ſo framed and conſtituted that they may the more eaſily receive the excrements of other parts: ſuch are the skin, and the parts looſe and porous. For Nature (that ſhe might the better preſerve the principal and more noble parts from Diſeaſes) hath purpoſely ordained in mans body ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain parts weak and feeble, that ſo the principal parts oppreſſed and burdened with Humors might into them empty whatever is ſuperfluous and burdenſom; and theſe (as we have ſaid) are the skin and glandulous or kernelly parts. And hence it is that the Heart tranſmits the peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors unto the Arm-pits, the Brain ſends them behind the Ears, and the Liver thruſts them forth to the Groyns. The parts ready to receive are al thoſe that have any connexion with the part that tranſmits the humors, and which have the paſſages through which the humors are conveyed alwaies patent and open; but as for waies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to expel and drive them forth, they are either none at al, or otherwiſe ſuch as are exceeding nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and over ſtreight; or elſe laſtly, theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are ſo ſcituated that they lie directly under the parts tranſmitting, ſo that the conveyance of Humors unto them from the aboveſaid parts is render'd the more facile and eaſie.</p>
                     <p>As for the waies and paſſages through which the humors run,<note place="margin">the paſſages by which the tumors flow.</note> they are either ſuch as lie hid, or elſe ſuch as are open and very manifeſt. For whereas the whol body is confluxile, that is to ſay, apt and ready to flow together; hence it is that the humors have their fluxion out of one part into another by theſe occult or hidden paſſages. So the Whey (as we may term it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gotten in great abundance into the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> or Cavity of the Belly (commonly called the Paunch) by theſe privy Paſſages deſcends into the Cods and the Thighs, and lifts up the ſaid parts even unto a Tumor or ſwelling; the ſame which likewiſe very often happens in other parts. Somtimes the humors aſſembled together betwixt the Skul and skin of the Head deſcend thence along under the skin into the inferior parts; but very ſeldom and rare it is that from hence any tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are produced. But moſt an end thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which excite and raiſe tumors flow through paſſages that are patent enough, the Veins and Arteries.</p>
                     <p>But that we may briefly come to ſpeak of the differences of Tumors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from Humors,<note place="margin">the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of tumors whence they are taken.</note> although very many of theſe differences are acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet notwithſtanding thoſe by which the tumors proceeding from humors are truly and properly diſtinguiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, are taken from the variety of the containing Cauſe, or the Humor as an effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe producing the Tumor. Now the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are divers, Blood, Choler, Flegm, Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, black Choler, Choler aduſt, and Whey. From which likewiſe various ſorts of Tumors are exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cauſed. And then again, one while the humor exciting the tumor is (as we uſe to ſay) ſimple and ſincere, from whence alſo the tumor proceeding therefrom is ſaid to be a pure tumor; or aſſoon again divers humors concur to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of one Tumor; and from hence the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which we term ſpurious, (that is, ſuch as are improperly ſo called) take their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>

                     <p>It is eaſily known whether the Tumor proceed from the falling down of any part: and if this be not the Cauſe, we may then ſafely conclude that the riſe of it is from the afflux of humors unto the part affected.</p>
                     <p>But now whether or no the Tumor takes its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from congeſtion, or rather from fluxion, may by this be diſcerned; to wit, that thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which are cauſed by congeſtion or the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of humors, are a longer while and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees arriving at their perfection; neither take they up ſo much room in the part; nor (laſtly) was there any the leaſt preceding cauſe or ſign of a defluxion. But now if the tumor be generated from a fluxion, it wil be diſcerned by the preſence of the contrary ſigns. And certainly if ſo be there were not in the grieved part any foregoing pain or heat, it manifeſtly ſhews that the ſaid fluxion is cauſed by a tranſmiſſion, and not by means of an attraction: like as on the other hand, a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pain or heat of the affected part argues the Tumor to proceed from the attraction of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p>For the Signs whereby to diſcern and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the times, take this advertiſement; viz. That the beginning of it is then when the part firſt of al is perceived to be diſtended and ſtretch'd forth. The increment or growth, when as the part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears now to be elevated into an indifferent big ſwelling, and when the Symptoms that accompany al ſorts of Tumors are evidently augmented. The ſtate or heighth of it is, when the ſwelling and (with it together) al the ſymptoms are at their higheſt pitch. The declination is then, when both the bulk of the ſwelling, and all the ſymptoms are ſenſibly diminiſhed.</p>

But ſo ſoon as the concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the crude or raw matter is compleated, ſo that the filth and impoſtumated matter appear, then the part becomes in a manner lighter than it was, the heat abated, diminiſhed, the pain aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and a part of the Tumor is eminently eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and begins to grow ſharp or ſword-pointed; and this ſharp point forthwith becomes of a white colour; and the part if touched with the Finger ſeems ſofter; and the purulent matter ſenſibly appears to fluctuate and yeild unto the touch of the Hand. Yet notwithſtanding it oftentimes chanceth, that the filth and corruption lies altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hid and obſcured, ſo that it may not eaſily be diſcerned, either by reaſon of the depth of the place, or the thickneſs of the part; as <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in his ſixth Book, Aphoriſm 41. doth rightly advertiſe us.</p>
                     <p>Signs of maturation (which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a ripening of crude or raw matter) now nigh at hand,<note place="margin">Signs of corruption and indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> are, a blackneſs, or a Leaden colour of the part affected. A ſign of Induration is, a diminution of the Tumor, but an augmentation of its hardneſs. A ſign of the Tumors retreating and decreaſing, is a ſudden and unexpected leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſwelling; which ſaid diminution if it proceed from an internall cauſe, is evermore evill; unleſs the matter retiring be evacuated by a fit and convenient way. Upon the going back of the matter immediately there follows a Feaver, if there were none before; or if there were any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is now much augmented; and other evil ſymptoms ariſe from the retention of the matter in the Body.</p>
                     <p>Now the beſt way of freeing the part of any Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor that grieves and afflicts it, is that which is performed by reſolution; and next unto this, that which is wrought by ſuppuration; but it is very il, that Tumors or ſwellings ſhould be harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and it is far worſe, nay worſt of all, that the part it ſelf ſhould be corrupted.</p>

If there be a diſtemper accompanying it, then for the better effecting the Cure, it is expedient in Tumors that are hot, that we uſe means to cool them; if they be cold, that we heat them; if moiſt, that by the help of Art we exſiccate and dry them; and laſtly, if they be dry, it is requiſite that we ſhould moiſten them. But then, in this alteration of the parts, their Nature, Temper, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Uſe, Figure, Scituation, and Senſe (al which preſcribe the meaſure of alteration) are carefully to be conſidered; of which I have already treated at large elſwhere, in my Inſtitutions, the fifth Book, ſecond part, ſecond Section, and firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>In the removal of the Cauſe, we muſt heedfully look whether the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor be already compleated,<note place="margin">the Cauſes of a tumor how to be taken away</note> and not like to receive any further increaſe or addition; or otherwiſe whether it may not be further augmented. For if the Tumor be already arrived at its perfection, then there is no more required but that we look back unto the conteining Cauſe, and then that we take the beſt courſe to remove it. But if the Tumor be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready at the heigth, but only in a tendency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
<pb n="2411" facs="tcp:49110:9"/> we muſt then alſo look back a little further unto the Antecedent Cauſe, as likewiſe the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is eſpecially to be done whenas the Tumor is generated from an afflux of humors. For in this kind of Tumor the fluxion it ſelf is to be oppoſed, and if poſſible, all its C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the Fluxion may be totally removed, if the flowing humor be either e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated by drawing of Blood, or by Purgation; or if the courſe of the flowing humor be turned a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother way; which is effected either by drawing it back unto the contrary parts, or by intercepting the motion of the humors in their paſſages or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſing of them from the part affected; or laſtly, by deriving of them unto the parts adjacent. Now the Cauſes of a Fluxion are taken away,<note place="margin">A Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how it may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> if we take away all ſuch things as conduce unto either the tranſmiſſion, or the attraction of humors; for in one of theſe two waies a Fluxion is both begun and carried on. The aforeſaid tranſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is cauſed, or at leaſt much furthered, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole, or ſome part ſtirred up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked either by the over great abundance, or by the quality of the humors, or by both toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is oppreſſive either of the whole, or of any particular part, it behoves us to diſcharge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, by opening a Vein, or by purging, or both waies; and then to corroborate both the part which breeds, and the part likewiſe that collects and receives theſe vitious humors; that ſo we may hereby free them of all their Obſtructions. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction is cauſed by reaſon of Pain, or Heat; and therefore it is mainly requiſite that the pain be removed, and the heat qualified by refrigerating Medicaments. But if the matter of the Tumor or ſwelling be gradually and by little &amp; little heaped up, then the Cauſe of this congeſtion (whether it be a diſtemper, or any other fault in the part) is to be removed. All which ſhal hereafter in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Tract of Tumors be made more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
                     <p>As for ſo much of the Tumor as is already cauſed,<note place="margin">A Humor how to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out of a tumor.</note> it is to be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated by freeing the part affected from that very humor which excites the Tumor. Now the humor is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away out of the affected part, either by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating of it unto ſome other part, or by the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating of it out of the Body. It is transferred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome other part, either by aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents and Medicines that drive back,<note place="margin">A Humor, how to be driven back</note> or elſe by Medicaments conſtringent, that is, ſuch as by compreſſion bring the part cloſe together; or otherwiſe by drawing of it unto other parts, which is effected by the ſenſe of pain, by heat, and by reaſon of a vacuity or emptineſs. Such things as repell and drive back (is elſwhere hath been ſaid) take place only where the matter is not as yet impacted and ſtuffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubſtance of the part, but only flows to and again in the greater or leſs Veſſels of the ſame, or elſe wi hout theſe Veſſels in the vacant ſpaces of the part; and which is neither ſo thick, nor yet ſo thin, that it can reſiſt the repelling Medicines. But if the matter be already farc'd into the part, that it is now neither poſſible not ſafe to repel and drive it back from thence (of which we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the fifth Book of our Inſtitutions, Part 1. Section 1. Chap. 8.) then in this caſe, repulſion hath no place, neither is it to be attempted. The peccant matter is evacuated out of the Body, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſibly, to wit, when it is even ſenſibly pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth of the parts, or elſe inſenſibly, when the matter is diſſipated by the Pores.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Diſcuſſion of Humors:</note>If there be no great ſtore of matter, and the part ſcituated above it be leſs compact, and the matter it ſelf not ſo extraodinarily thick, then it is to be expel'd by inſenſible diſcuſſion. But then notwithſtanding if the matter to be ſcattered be any thing hard, it is fi ſt of all to be ſoftened, that ſo it may the more eaſily be diſcuſſed by the pores of the Skin. But then again on the other ſide, if the matter conteined in the Tumor be in greater abundance, and withal thick; and if the part lying above it be cloſe and compact, the matter is then rather to be ſenſibly evacuated by opening the Tumor.</p>

Thoſe that proceed from good Blood, and eſpecially in a fleſhy part, are eaſily and ſoon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turated: but thoſe Tumors which are bred out of other humors, and have their reſidence neer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Joynts, and in the ſinewy parts, thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that are weak and have in them but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little native heat, are with far more difficulty brought unto a maturation. Now of the matter which is gathered together in an Apoſtem, there is great variety according to that of the humors. Out of good Blood is generated a filth that is leſs offenſive; but out of the other humors is bred ſomthing that reſembles matter, Green, Yellow, or ſome other color, Pricking, and Stinking. For as for this preternatural matter, if it may not be driven forth, Nature then ſeparates it from the parts conteining; and thus being ſevered from the other parts, Nature collects it into one place, and there digeſts it ſo far forth as the nature of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter doth admit.</p>
                  <p>And indeed of the matter that is diſcovered in Impoſtumes there is evermore great variety. For there is not only that which we cal <hi>Pus, i. e.</hi> a ſtinking Corrupt matter found therein, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe now and then a ſubſtance reſembling Gruell, Honey, Suet, the Lees of Wine, the Dregs of Oyl; and ſomtimes alſo never a whit unlike unto Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Snivel blended together; and that oft-times of ſo ill a favor, that no one is able to abide the Stench: and as ſoon again alſo we may therein diſcern ſubſtances like unto Hairs, Nails, Bones, Stones, Worms, Wood, Coals, Cockle-ſhels, as before alſo (in the beginning of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter) we have acquainted you. Yea moreover alſo in Impoſtumes not unuſually there are found Worms alive, and other ſuch like little Creatures that have life: and <hi>Philoxenus</hi> writes (as <hi>Aetius</hi> reports, <hi>Tetrab.</hi> 4. <hi>Serm.</hi> 3. Chapter 7.) that on a time he diſcovered in a Tumor ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned living Creatures like unto Gnats, or ſmal Flies. And it is a wel-known truth, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the Body may be wholly changed and converted into Worms, and ſuch like ſubſtances in great variety. But then if Coals, Woods, Shels, or any thing elſe of a like nature (into which the humors cannot poſſibly be conceived to paſs) and more eſpecially when they reſemble any thing that is feaſible by Art) ſhal chance to be found in Tumors, then without doubt we ought to aſcribe it unto Sorcery and Witchcraft. And this likewiſe (as touching the difference of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes) is to be taken notice of (the ſame that <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in his fourteenth Book of the Method of Phyſick, and twelfth Chapter) viz. that the matter into which the humor cauſing the Tumor is converted, one while flows to and again in the Cavity of the Tumor, and is gotten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the nook thereof; and as ſoon again it is ſhut up in its own peculiar Membrane, as it ſhal further be made to appear when we come to treat of the Tumors we cal <hi>Meliceries, Atheroma,</hi> and <hi>Steatoma.</hi> Albeit there have not been wanting ſome (as we may read in <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his ſixth Book, and Chap. 36.) who were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thoſe Tumors alone were to be properly termed Impoſtumes, that did participate of an Inflammation and Pain, and had within them a ſharp and corroding humor; and were not at all conteined in their own peculiar little Skin or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle.</p>

                     <head>The Signs Diagnoſtick.</head>
                     <p>Now then in an Inflammation it may eaſily be diſcerned when the humor that cauſeth the Tumor is turn'd into a purulent matter. In other Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors notwithſtanding there are Signs given which may demonſtrate whether or no they be changed into an Impoſtume. As to inſtance, Until that the Tumor be turned into an Impoſtume,<note place="margin">Signs of ſuppuration.</note> it is never a whit leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, but there is perceived a more intenſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the part, the Heat, Pain, and the other ſymptoms are heightned; hence it is that <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in the ſecond of his Aphoriſms, Aphor 47. writes, that til the time of maturation the Pains and Feavers are intenſe. And beſides ſome one part or other of the Tumor begins to be ſharp-pointed, the matter then ſeeking its paſſage forth and thereby lifting up the part into a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</p>
                     <p>But ſo ſoon as the humor is converted into Snot or that kind of matter which much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth it, then, and not til then, there is an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Feaver and pain, and then the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling round about is ſomthing diminiſhed, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
<pb n="2413" facs="tcp:49110:10"/> and hardneſs a little remitted, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is ſenſible of eaſe and a kind of lightſomneſs; for then in Tumors that are hot the heat is abated and becomes remiſs whenas the matter is al gotten together into ſome one part: and hereupon the tumor it ſelf in that part where the matter is thus collected is raiſed up into a ſharp point. And at length, if the place be preſſed down with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, there is a ſoftneſs and a certain kind of floting of the matter underneath ſenſibly perceived in the part. Yet notwithſtanding that we be not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in this point, a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For now and then there is no fluctuation at all to be perceived, to wit, when either the matter is over thick, or otherwiſe when it is ſcituated in a part very deep. Concerning which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thus inſtructs us, in the ſixth Book of his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſius, Aphor. 41. when he ſaith, That for thoſe which have a ſuppuration in the body really exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent and in being, which yet notwithſtanding appears not unto them, the reaſon why it lieth undiſcovered unto them is in regard of the thick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs either of the matter, or of the place where it hath its reſidence. But ſomtimes there is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſomwhat like unto this fluctuation or floting, albeit there be no filth or corrupt matter underneath; which happeneth about the Knees, and other joynts, where there is no fleſh under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the skin.</p>

For Medicines moſt commonly protract and delay the Cure, excite and cauſe both heat and pain in the part; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it happeneth that the temper and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the part, which was before much weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Diſeaſe, becomes now wholly ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and from hence dangerous ſymptoms do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhew themſelves. Now and then not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, as for inſtance, in the watery Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Teſticles, when with the Iron we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily penetrate unto the bottom of the place wherein the vitious matter is contained, we ought to uſe a potential Cautery. For the way being once opened by a potential Cautery may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be dilated as much as we ſee cauſe for; that ſo the Inſtrument may the better pierce the part, and reach even unto the deepeſt place, and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom thereof.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid operation with an Iron is effected whenas the opening is made by an Iron Inſtrument made red hot,<note place="margin">How many waies a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor may he opened.</note> or elſe with an Iron Inciſion knife that hath not been heated in the fire. We very ſeldom make uſe of the hot Iron, and then never but in cold tumors; and that alſo only whilſt the impoſtume is in thoſe parts that have in them either many, or elſe large Veins and Arteries; that ſo the flux of Blood (which we cal the Hemorrhage) may the better be pre-cautioned and prevented. But as for the Inciſion Iron that hath not been heated, we uſe it moſt frequently, and that with very good ſucceſs. But if it ſhall ſo happen, that upon the opening of the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume, ſomtimes pain, and ſomtimes an efflux of blood ſhal enſue; and likewiſe that by reaſon of the abundant evacuation of the matter; or elſe that by pain and fear, a ſinking away or ſwooning ſhould follow; in this caſe we muſt endeavor that the Section may be performed with the greateſt ſpeed, and the leaſt pain that poſſibly may be. If an Hemorrhage be feared, we muſt have in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs thoſe Medicaments that ſtop the flux of
<pb n="2415" facs="tcp:49110:11"/> Blood, as Frankincenſe, Aloes, the white of an Egg, Bole Armenick, Pomegranate flowers, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons blood, and the like. To prevent fainting and ſwooning, eſpecially in Children, Women, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fearful perſons, we ought to have at hand ſuch Medicaments as are in uſe againſt this faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind. As alſo that there may be a right and orderly proceeding in the Section or opening,<note place="margin">The opening of a Tumor in what manner to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> the condition of the part, the ſcituation of the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves, as likewiſe the Nature of the Muſcles, all theſe ought to be exactly known and learned by the Chirurgeon from what is written by Anatomiſts; leſt otherwiſe Veins and Arteries ſhould be cut, and an Hemorrhage thereby cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; or that pain ſhould ariſe from this hurting and cutting of the Nerves; or that hereby the Member ſhould be altogether deprived of ſenſe; or laſtly, that by the hurting of the Muſcles the part ſhould be wholly deprived of its motion. Moreover alſo, a ſpecial regard muſt be had unto the fibres in the Muſcles, ſo that the Section ought to be performed according to the conduct of theſe fibres, that is to ſay, not oblickly or overthwartly; for this kind of Section wil greatly annoy the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the part. We muſt again heedfully weigh and conſider, in what meaſure, and how great the Section ought to be. For if it be over little, the <hi>Pus</hi> or corrupt matter, eſpecially if it be thick and cloddy, wil have no paſſage forth without compreſſion of the part, which wil both aſſuredly excite pain, and beget a kind of brawny hardneſs in the part, which may be the cauſe of a Fiſtula. And on the other ſide, if the ſection be made overgreat and wide, there wil then be left remaining a great and unſightly ſcar; and which is worſe, the ambient Air getting in wil alter the part: and therefore the Section ought to be made in ſuch a manner and meaſure, as ſhal be moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the evacuation of the Corruption and filth. And although the ſection be ſomwhat with the leaſt, it may notwithſtanding very eaſily be dilated by thruſting a tent into the hole thereof. To make the Inciſion we admit of either the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, or the Knife of Myrtle wood edged on both ſides, with which the Italians and French open Veins; or elſe that Knife which we cal <hi>Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomus,</hi> which the Germans uſe; or laſtly, that which we cal <hi>Syringotomos,</hi> an Inſtrument croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and of uſe only in the inciſion of an internal, or a concavous body.</p>
                     <p>The inciſion being made, if there be but little filth,<note place="margin">The evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the <hi>Pus,</hi> or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt matter</note> the part is with the finger to be preſſed down, to the end that it may the more readily flow forth: but if there be great ſtore of this filth and matter, it is then to be drawn forth leiſurely, and by little at a time, leſt haply (if it ſhould be evacuated al together, ſuddenly, and on an heap as it were) much of the ſpirits ſhould therewithal exhale, and thereupon a fainting and ſwooning ſhould enſue.</p>
                     <p>After Inciſion, and the emptying forth of the corruption, it will be convenient the firſt day to ſtrow thereon the duſt of Frankincenſe; on the ſecond day to lay thereon ſome kind of Digeſtive or other, that ſo if any thing yet remain undige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, the compleat digeſtion thereof may hereby be accompliſhed. And if there be preſent any filth, or any kind of uncleanneſs which may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the growth of fleſh ſhal chance to occur, they are forthwith to be wiped and cleanſed away. As for example:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Turpentine one ounce; Honey of Roſes half an ounce; and of Barley Meal as much as is requiſite, and ſo make a mixture, and uſe it for the purpoſe aforeſaid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Ulcer require yet a more forcible clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by reaſon of its extraordinary naſtineſs, then we ought to uſe the ſtronger Abſterſives, as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum Apoſtolorum, &amp;c.</hi> And at length Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks, that is, ſuch Medicaments as cauſe fleſh to breed and grow, are wiſely to be applied; and the oriſice of the Ulcer to be ſhut up with a ſcar.</p>
                     <p>Here we are to take notice, That ſomtimes Impoſtumes may for a long ſpace he hid not only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the external Muſcles,<note place="margin">Of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumes lying hid, two hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.</note> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe under the more profound, yea, and the more internal Muſcles alſo. Concerning the Impoſtumes of the Muſcles of the lower belly or Paunch, we have already ſpoken in the third Book, Part 10. Chap. 7. As touching the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes in the great Muſcle <hi>Pſoa, Gulielmus Fabricius</hi> in his firſt Century, and ſixty third Obſervation, relates two Hiſtories: And firſt he tels us, that a certain Matron took her bed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of acute and extream pains about her Loyns, which was accompanied with a Feaver, ſwooning fits, and difficulty of making water. And when it was ſufficiently underſtood by the kind of the pain, and other ſigns and tokens, to be an inward Impoſtume (for outwardly there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not any thing, neither could there any thing be diſcerned by the touch) and that this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtem could be no where but under the <hi>Pſoa</hi> Muſcle; and when that the ſick party was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the extream danger and hazard of her life, unleſs the Impoſtume were opened, and the humor cauſed to flow forth; both her ſelf and her friends gave their conſent, that on one ſide of the <hi>Spina dorſi,</hi> or back-bone, the skin and the exterior Muſcles even unto the <hi>Pſoa</hi> Muſcle ſhould be opened by an Inciſion with a Razor: which was done accordingly, and out there flows a purulent and ſtinking humor, and ſo, after that ſome certain cleanſing and abſterſive Medicaments had been for ſome few months applied, ſhe became perfectly recovered. The other Hiſtory which he relates, is this: In the Year One thouſand five
<pb n="2416" facs="tcp:49110:12"/> hundred eighty five, a certain yong man, aged twenty ſeven years, or thereabouts, as he was deſcending from the higheſt pitch of the Mountain <hi>Cinecius</hi> unto the loweſt part thereof, not well minding his footſteps in a very ſteep path, he or ever he was aware fel or rather tumbled down backwards; and that which added unto the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of the fall, was this, the hilt of his Sword lighting under the ſhort Ribs and the left Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney exceedingly cruſhed and bruiſed his Loyns. After this his fall, for a few daies at the firſt, the pains he felt were not many; not long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>er he grew ſenſible of pains in the left part of his Loyns, but they were as yet very ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap> and remiſs: now from hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward theſe never left him, until at length by an inſenſible and gradual growth they arrived at the heighth of their increment, inſomuch that at length they became extreamly ſharp and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. Upon this immediately follows the loſs of ſleep and appetite; whenas notwithſtanding at that very inſtant the ſick party was not afflicted with any great thirſt, or very violent Feaver. Neither was the part affected ever a whit diſcolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or as we ſay, black and blue: nor did there at al any outward ſwelling appear, nor was there the leaſt imaginable external blemiſh any where to be ſeen; but al the parts ſeemed to be, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were what they ſeemed, plain and even, and in no point at al altered from their natural ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or color. But as afterward the event it ſelf plainly evidenced, abundance of humors from all parts of the body had met together in the Muſcle <hi>Pſoa.</hi> In the firſt place he was by a certain Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian tampered withal as a Nephritick Perſon, that is, one troubled with the pains of his Reins; but the Doctor was much miſtaken. For at length whenas no one ſign of the aforeſaid Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phritical effect appeared; and the ſick party had not received the leaſt benefit by what had been preſcribed; he was in the next place ſent unto <hi>Johannes Griffonius;</hi> who inſtantly diſcovered the whol grief, and the miſchief that it threatened; all which he very wel knew; and likewiſe the danger impending from the ſhutting up of the noyſom purulent matter in the inwards, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the yong man; and that his Opinion was, it ought to be evacuated. Unto whoſe will the yong man giving his conſent, commits himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cure. What doth this expert <hi>Griffonius</hi> hereupon? In the firſt place he takes care, that the matter which had now ſeized upon, and did poſſeſs the whol Region of the Loyns, ſhould all of it be drawn together into ſomeone place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (by the applications of thoſe Medicaments which had a vertue in them powerfully to attract from on high) to wit, ſuch a place, where the principal Veſſels were but few, and where the Inſtruments of motion might leaſt be harmed amidſt their operation. Which his deſign when (ever and anon attempting the part with a Silver Probe) he wel perceived by the ſenſe of pain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, that he had ſucceſsfully accompliſhed, without any more ado he lanceth on the left ſide the fleſh nigh unto the fourth Vertebra of the Loyns, with a fire-hot Razor, making a Wound as deep and long as is the fore finger from the end thereof unto the hollow of the hand; as afterward it was eaſie for him to conjecture by that long ſharp tent which he put thereinto. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, when he had conveyed down two of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into that ſame Wound (to the end he might widen the paſſage forth) out there iſſueth great ſtore of matter and ſtinking ſtuff. And then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preſcribed the manner of evacuation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of Art, the Chirurgeon ordains for the Patient a ſharp tent made of Silver, the which being firſt dipt in cleanſing and abſterſive Unguents, he enjoyned him to uſe for ſome months. So that by this means the lips of the Wound came cloſe together of their own accord; and the yong man recovered his former perfect health.</p>
                     <p>And this is likewiſe as a thing remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable to be taken notice of,<note place="margin">The humor that flows out of an Impoſtume ſomtimes tranſlated into other parts.</note> That Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes lying concealed in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if they be not opened, then they ſomtimes ſeek out another paſſage, and thereby flow forth unto ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. And ſo the afore menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius,</hi> in his firſt Century, and 81. Obſervat. relates of a child three months old, that was ſorely afflicted with an Impoſtume neer unto his right ſhoulder. But the Parents would by no perſwaſions be wrought upon to admit of an Inciſion; ſo that by degrees the Tumor ſeemed much leſſened and abated. But at length it being opened, ſome ſmal and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantity of matter iſſued forth, and the Tumor by little and little became in a ſhort ſpace wholly extinct, and ſunk away; the humor now and then a little at a time gliding downwards into the lower belly, and the genitals; by which the radical Native heat being deſtroyed, a Gangrene follows thereupon, and after a few daies a <hi>Spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celus,</hi> and in a very ſhort time death demands his due.</p>
                     <p>And this may ſuffice to have been ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Tumors in general ariſing from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. Now we wil take a view of them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and in their ſeveral ſpecies or kinds. Now in the firſt place, thoſe Tumors that take their riſe and original from the Blood preſent themſelves unto our conſideration; and among them, we ſhal firſt ſpeak to that kind of Tumor which we call <hi>Corpulentia nimia,</hi> or extream corpulency.</p>

                  <p>TRuth it is, that <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, Chap. 1. affirms, that Fat and Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="2417" facs="tcp:49110:12"/> men are ſaid to be ſuch as have a Bulk and vaſtneſs, not ſuch as is altogether preternatural, that is, beſide, above, or beyond Natures intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (much leſs contrary unto it) but ſuch as may be ſaid to be not Natural, and above that which is according to Nature. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the very ſame place he immediately adds, that the exceſſes of diſpoſitions which are not by Nature are therefore beſides Nature; and that (in very truth) the hurting of the actions doth terminate the exceſſes of ſuch as are corpulent. And therefore, ſince that the Bulk of the Body doth now and then attain unto ſo extraordinary a vaſtneſs, that Natures operations are thereby much impeded and hurt, he doth upon very good grounds (in his Book of the differences of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the ninth Chapter) reduce extream corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, or overmuch Fleſhineſs, unto the Diſeaſes of magnitude augmented. For the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> in the place alleadged, <hi>viz.</hi> Chap. 9. of his Book of the differences of Diſeaſes, reports of a certain man, one <hi>Nicomachus</hi> of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> that his Body grew to ſo huge and extraordinary a bulk, that he could not ſtir from one place unto another. And within our remembrance alſo, by the Pictures brought hither and here expoſed unto publick view, a certain Rope-makers Wife of <hi>Strasburg</hi> (a City of <hi>Alſatia</hi>) became very wel known; who in the yeer 1613. and of her own age the 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi> weighed four hundred and eighty pounds. And I my ſelf of late daies ſaw here a man who weighed more than four hundred pound; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this man appeared in publick: and to tel you the whol truth, in this Perſon Nature began to aſſay ſome certain kind of evacuation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or wheyie humor by the Navel. And the very ſame hath been found to happen unto others alſo, in whom the Body hath attained unto ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe a bigneſs, that they could neither move, nor yet ſo much as breathe freely. But now in ſuch like Perſons as theſe, there is not an equal augmentation of all the parts of the Body (as it is in them who grow, and are naturally enlarged) but only of their Fleſh, and of their Fat there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and over-great encreaſe.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>The conjunct Cauſe therefore of this Tumor of the whole Body is the Fleſh and the Fat. And here truly one while the Fleſh, and otherwhile the Fat is augmented: and ſometimes they are both alike encreaſed. But the Antecedent Cauſe is the over-great abundance of Fat and good Blood. And for this cauſe it is, that this Tumor is referred unto Tumors proceeding from the Blood. And yet notwithſtanding the Reaſon of theſe is far differing from that of other Tumors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the Blood. For the conteining Cauſe of bloody Tumors is the Blood, but the contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Cauſe of this Tumor is the Fat, and Fleſh; and the antecedent Cauſe is the Blood. The reſt of the bloody Tumors that are properly ſo called ſpring from the Blood iſſuing out of the Veins or Veſſels into ſome other places; which never hapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this extream and extraordinary corpulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the which Blood is never known to fall or iſſue forth into other places, but it is evermore put unto the Body.</p>
                     <p>But now what the Cauſes may be that much Fleſh and Fat ſhould be generated, will eaſily and ſoon be diſcovered, if we wel conſider the Cauſes of breeding Fleſh and Fat. Now then Fleſh is abundantly bred in thoſe whom we call <hi>Euſarcoi,</hi> that is, Perſons of a pure, untainted, and ſound Fleſh; yet alwaies provided, that the material cauſe of Fleſh, to wit, nouriſhing Food, be not wanting; and likewiſe that the native virtue gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Fleſh be as it ought to be, vigorous and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. That which adminiſters matter towards the breeding of fleſh is great abundance of good blood; the which to produce and generate, meats of a good and plentiful juyce, and alſo a due and right temper of the Liver, to wit, hot and moiſt, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore requiſite. But now again that much Fleſh may be bred from much Blood, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that there be a ſound and healthful habit of Body, and a good temperament of the muſculous parts in the Body; which ſaid temperament is likewiſe hot and moiſt. Hereunto alſo (as we are to underſtand) very much conduceth an eaſie or idle kind of life, in the which there is not much Blood waſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed; as alſo the ſuppreſſion of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed bleedings, and evacuations of Blood, eſpecially in Women. As touching the original and increment of Fat, many and various are the Opinions and controverſies among the Phyſitians at this very day; the which for me in this place to examin were altogether impertinent. And therefore in a word we ſay, that Fat is generated from the Oyly and fattiſh part of the Blood, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from out of the Veins and Arteries into the membranous parts, and there digeſted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate virtue and temperate heat of the Membranes. That great ſtore of Fat ſhould be bred, in the firſt place, the Liver is a principal cauſe thereof. For if by reaſon of its excellent and perfect tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it doth not generate either much earthy and cold, nor much cholerick and hot juyce, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſweet fat, and oyly Blood, and fil the Veins and Arteries therewith; and if this Blood be not conſumed or waſted in the habit of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but that it ſtil continue to be more cool and moiſt, then this Blood is there converted into Fat. Eaſe likewiſe, and the intermiſſion of Exerciſe, the retention of accuſtomed evacuations, aliment temperately hot and moiſt; and generally all things which either outwardly or inwardly any waies conduce to the making up of a plentifull and temperate maſs of Blood; or that have in them an efficacy in qualifying and allaying the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-intenſe heat of the Blood of the Entrails, and of the habit of the Body. Hence it is that <hi>Galen</hi>
                        <pb n="2418" facs="tcp:49110:13"/> hath left it upon record; that all Bodies ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towards a cold and moiſt temperament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Fat. And with this of <hi>Galen</hi> agreeth what <hi>Proſper Alpinus</hi> in his Book of the Egyptian Phyſitians, Chap. 9. hath written; his words are theſe, The Bodies of the Egyptians (ſaith he) are hot and dry, in regard that they live under the hotteſt (and withall dry) poſition of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: but becauſe they moderate and leſſen this heat and drineſs by their dayly drinking of water, by their continual uſe of meats that have in them a cooling virtue, and likewiſe by their frequent uſe of Baths which they make for themſelves with ſweet Water; their bodies hereupon become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily fat, to fat, that he never beheld in any part of the world in ſo great a number and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuch extream fat and groſs Perſons as he ſaw at <hi>Grand Cayre</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> For he reports that very many of them are ſo exceeding groſs and corpulent, and generally ſo fat in their Breaſts, that they have Paps of a far larger ſize, and thicker than the greateſt that ever he had obſerved in any Woman. Other things there are which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate unto us the truth of this aſſertion, to wit, that a hot temperament of the Liver makes very much for the breeding and augmenting of fat. For I my ſelf knew a Perſon of Honor, who after he had been ſick, and was recovered of a malignant Feaver, grew to be ſo extreamly fat and groſs, that he could very hardly move, or ſtir himſelf in any place where he fat; and as for the bulk of his body, he came never a whit behind him whom we have formerly mentioned.</p>

What the inconveniencies and diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are that this over-great fleſhineſs or (as we term it) extream Corpulency carries along with it, I ſhal give you an account thereof in the words of <hi>Avicen</hi> that expert Arabian Phyſitian. For thus he, in his fourth Book, Part 7. Tract. 4. Chap. 5. Superfluous fat (ſaith he) is that which hinders the body from and in its motion, walking and operation; and ſtreightning the Veins with an undue and dangerous conſtriction: whereupon it oppilates and ſtops up the paſſages of the Spirit, ſo that hereby it is many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; and for the ſame reaſon likewiſe it is that ſuch Perſons have no refreſhment from the breathings in the ambient Air, which finding the paſſages obſtructed, proceeds not ſo far as the <hi>Praecordia</hi> (or Entrails) to moderate and qualifie their exceſſive heat: and they are in continual fear, leſt that their Blood ſhould again be driven forth unto the ſtreightned place. Whereupon haply they wil give way that a Vein be ſuddenly opened, which may prove very pernicious unto them. And truly in this kind of diſpoſition there happeneth unto them an extream &amp; dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction or ſtreightning of their breathing, &amp; a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Heart. Hereupon they are evermore expoſed to a ſudden death; and eſpecially thoſe of them that are fatned in their younger daies; for theſe have alwaies their Veins very ſmal, and much ſtreightned. And they are likewiſe expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto the Apoplexy, and Palſie, and throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of the Heart, and the Flux <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> by reaſon of their humidity; they are alſo ſubject to fainting and ſwooning fits, and the worſt ſorts of Feavers; neither can they away with fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting or thirſt, by reaſon of the conſtriction of the paſſages of breath, the vehemency of the cold of their complexion, their ſmal ſtore of Blood, and the abundance of their Phlegm. And to this moreover may be added, that they are (whether they be Men or Women) iſſueleſs and barren; the Male being not able to Generate, nor the Female to produce the <hi>Embryo</hi> in the Womb. As alſo their Seed is little or none at all (to wit) becauſe it is concocted, through the imbecility of the heat; although there may be ſtore of Seed in regard of their humidity or moiſture; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch as is wateriſh, and (in <hi>Galens</hi> judgment) thin, and unmeet for Generation; or if it be generative, it is of Females only. And the like may be ſaid of Women, that thoſe of them which are fat, do not conceive, or if they do now and then conceive, they forthwith miſcarry; and laſtly, their appetite (to wit that which is natural) is exceeding weak.

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>The Cure of this Tumor conſiſts in the removal of the Cauſe which is an over-great ſtore of Fleſh and Fat. Now this abundant fleſh and fat is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, by waſting and annihilating what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready generated, and then by taking a courſe that it may not again be multiplied: and this may be done, if we take care that too great an abundance of Blood be not bred; or that which is already in the Body, that it be by degrees waſted and leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Both theſe intentions are accompliſhed by thoſe things that heat, and exſiccate, or dry much. For whereas the Liver, if it hath a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, remiſs, and temperate heat, generates great
<pb n="2419" facs="tcp:49110:13"/> plenty of ſweet and Oyly blood, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally foments matter for the breeding of much fat and ſtore of fleſh; if now this temperate conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Liver ſhal be altered, and the Liver rendered more hot &amp; dry than formerly; then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of good and laudable, I mean, fat and oyly blood, it generates that which is hot and cholerick, or that which is ſerous, wheyiſh, &amp; wateriſh. And thus it is that Medicaments hot and dry do both retard the propagation of an abundant and olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous blood, and alſo they waſte, and by degrees conſume the fat that is there already bred throughout the body. But then for the waſting or leſſening of the fleſh already bred, thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments are the moſt prevalent in which ſiccity (or drineſs) is predominant, and the heat in a mediocrity. By what hath been ſaid you cannot but underſtand, how that in curing this affect we ought heedfully to obſerve, whether it be the fleſh, or whether or no it be the fat that offends in the exceſs; and ſo accordingly fit and proper Medicaments are to be made choyce of: and as for ſuch as are undoubtedly exceeding ful of fleſh (and ſuch generally are al thoſe that have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and habits of Wraſtlers) we are not to preſcribe unto them ſuch Medicaments as either cauſe or encreaſe heat, but only ſuch as meerly dry and attenuate; and ſuch are, Veneſection, <hi>i. e.</hi> Blood-letting, Purgation, abſtinence from food, and frictions, or rubbings. In fat perſons we may notwithſtanding properly enough make uſe of Remedies that are of a heating Nature; but yet ſo as that in the adminiſtring of them we be very circumſpect, leſt that by the overmuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting we procure ſome other Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>And therefore when as the blood adminiſters matter for the raiſing of an abundant ſtore of fleſh and fat, it is to be forthwith evacuated and diminiſhed. And for ſuch as are ful of fleſh we may ſafely enough exact a more liberal and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evacuation of the blood, yet alwaies provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the evacuation be not proſcecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in thoſe that abound with fat, this letting out of the blood ought to be more ſparing, ſince that fat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are more propenſe unto cold diſtempers. Cupping-glaſſes alſo either with or without ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification are very uſeful and proper for both the one and the other. Frequent, rough, and hard frictions of the whol body are likewiſe chiefly convenient. <hi>Pliny</hi> in B. 11. Chap. 37. writes, That the Son of <hi>L. Apronius</hi> (who had been <hi>Conſul</hi>) was contented to have his fatneſs drawn away from him,<note place="margin">Fat drawn out of the body of one extreamly fat.</note> thereby to alleviate and lighten his body (til then immovable) of ſome part of his burden. But no man wil eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſo deſperate and barbarous a Remedy; and therefore I forbear to ſpeak any thing more concerning it. Exſiccating or drying Baths, whether taken by drinking, or made uſe of for the bathing of the body, are in this caſe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular benefit. Frequent purgations with Aloes (unto which may be added Mirrh and Nitre) are here likewiſe very convenient; and conſequently the Pills <hi>de Tribus</hi> muſt needs be a proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Such are alſo al bitter and hot Medicaments adminiſtred, as namely, Wormwood, Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Rue, <hi>Oxymel ſimplex,</hi> and <hi>Oxymel compoſitum, Oxymel of Squils,</hi> the Syrup <hi>de duabus</hi> and <hi>de quinque radicibus;</hi> and generally al things that provoke and expel Urine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the roots of Aſparagus and Fennel, and of Parſley, and ſuch like, ought very frequently to be uſed. This Pouder likewiſe is much approved of, and commended; viz.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Salt of Nitre one dram; Allum two ſcruples; Myrrh, Frankincenſe, the Rind of the Wood Guajacum, the Root of Sarſaparilla, of each of theſe two drams; and ſo make a Pouder:</hi> Of the which let half a dram be adminiſtred in the morning for two months together.

                  <p>BUt now that we may come to treat of Tumors properly ſo called (ariſing from the blood) thoſe Tumors are indeed wondrous frequent, and they appear very commonly, in regard that they proceed not only of and from themſelves, but they likewiſe happen and follow upon divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affects, as Wounds, Fractures, disjoyntings, and the like. And this Tumor from the Blood is by the Grecians named <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines an Inflammation. But now the word <hi>Phlegmone</hi> hath been very variouſly and in a far differing ſence made uſe of by the ancient Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and thoſe of later ſtanding. For with <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> and generally al the Phyſitians before <hi>Eraſiſtratus,</hi> the word <hi>Phlegmone</hi> was uſed to ſignifie al ſorts of <hi>Phlogoſies,</hi> that is, every kind of extraordinary heat exceeding the bounds and tranſcending the limits of Nature, although it be without any afflux of matter, or any kind of ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whatſoever. But after <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> his daies, the word <hi>Phlegmone</hi> was accuſtomarily uſed to denote thoſe Tumors alone in which there was not only a vehement and fiery inflamed heat, but likewiſe alſo therewithal a certain kind of renitency or reſiſtance, and a beating in the part, with a more than ordinary redneſs of color; all which laſt mentioned Species of Tumors <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> was wont to call <hi>Oedemata ſclera</hi> and <hi>epodyna,</hi> that is to ſay, hard, callous, and painful ſwellings; as <hi>Galen</hi> hath obſerved in his ſecond Book of the difference of Reſpiration or brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Chap. 7. and in his Book 3.

For a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> happeneth likewiſe unto the Membranous parts; as to inſtance, in a Pleuriſie, the Membrane that girts about and encompaſſeth the Ribs is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; in the Phrenſie, the Membranes of the Brain; and ſo in like manner, the ſmal Veſſels and Membranes of the eyes ſuffer an Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the affect which we cal <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> or an Inflammation in the uppermoſt skin of the eye. Neither are (beſides the fleſh) only the Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous parts ſubject unto Inflammation; but alſo the glandulous or kernelly parts are often infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſwollen up by reaſon of the blood flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into them. And laſt of al, not only the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſclely fleſh, but likewiſe alſo the ſubſtances of all the other bowels (which have their fleſh much differing from that of the Muſcles) are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afflicted with Inflammations; as it is moſt apparently manifeſt in the Inflammations of the Liver, Spleen, Brain, and all the reſt of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails. And this very Truth <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf waves not, neither doth he paſs it over in ſilence, whenas (neer about the cloſe of the Chapter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged) he thus writes; But likewiſe alſo in proceſs of time, the skin it ſelf (ſaith he) takes unto it ſelf ſomthing of a fluid and fluxile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as alſo do the Tunicles of the greater Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and ſo likewiſe even the Membranes themſelves in the part inflamed: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over alſo, even the Nerves and Tendons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in proceſs of time are made to partake of this very ſame Inflammation: Thus much <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth.</p>

In each one of the Primary and ſimple parts there is, ſaith he, one part or portion of the ſubſtance thereof which is as it were fibrous, another that is Membranous, and a third that is fleſhy. As for example, whenas a Vein hath but one only Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, and that likewiſe very thin, we may even then and there diſcover many of the fibres in this one thin Tunicle, which are interſerted, as I may ſo ſay, by their certain Spider-like interweavings; and unto the which the very proper ſubſtance of the Vein doth adhere, as growing thereunto. But in other parts of the Body this fleſh is of a far differing nature, neither hath it as yet gotten any
<pb n="2421" facs="tcp:49110:14"/> common name. But that you may the better underſtand us now that we are treating of this ſubject, I know nothing to the contrary, but that you may term it a fleſhy ſubſtance; or truly at leaſtwiſe we may call it a certain fleſh peculiar and proper unto this little part; and of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Nature from that of the ſtomach, from that of the Liver, and likewiſe from that of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Muſcles; in al which the fleſh is not one and the ſame, but (as I ſaid) much differing. Thus far <hi>Galen.</hi> Wherefore that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what the ſubject of an Inflammation is, we affirm it to be any kind of fleſhy ſubſtance which hath Veins &amp; Arteries which contain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, and convey blood, the Cauſe of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation; and are therefore even upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count oppoſite to the bones, which neither have, nor are ſo much as capable of receiving Veins. For in good truth, fleſh is the chief and principal ſubject of Inflammation: yet notwithſtanding the blood, if it both diffuſe it ſelf into the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent parts, and likewiſe draw thoſe parts into a conſent and agreement with it ſelf, they may then al of them (both it &amp; they) be truly ſaid to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inflamed: of which <hi>Galen</hi> treats at large, in his Book of Tumors, Chap. 2. where he thus writes: That al that fleſh whoſe affection is now mainly, and in the higheſt degree become an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, ſhould ſeem to be repleniſhed with a flowing of the blood, both the color and the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor it ſelf demonſtrate; whereupon it appears all over humid and extreamly moiſtened, like as is wool and a ſpunge. That filth and putrid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which flows forth whenas the Inflammation hath gotten a little door or gate (as we may ſo tetm it) to caſt it out by, gives a ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto the truth of what hath been ſaid; and I am rightly of Opinion, that the skin it ſelf is elevated, and extended round about, at once and together with the Tumors and ſwellings of thoſe things that lie underneath it. And in tract of time even the skin it ſelf participates ſomwhat of the aforementioned flux; inſomuch that the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of the greater Veſſels, and alſo the very Membranes themſelves may ſuffer together with the part inflamed: and moreover alſo even the very Nerves and Tendons in proceſs of time come to partake of this ſame Inflammation. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding now and then it chanceth that the parts aboveſaid (all or ſome of them) if they happen to be wounded, or any other way diſaffected, then the hurtful diſtemper, I mean the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath its original from out of thoſe very parts. But univerſally and generally there is not any thing that according to the bent of Nature perſeveres to carry it ſelf in al things exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto the inflamed part, if there be but any the leaſt ſtop put thereunto; but al things together with the fleſh participate of the ſaid flux; ſo that oftentimes it reacheth even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bones, like as many times alſo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in the ſpecies of Teeth, <hi>Galen</hi> in his 5.

                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>As for the Cauſe of this preternatural affect, <hi>Galen</hi> writes that as it is altogether unknown unto the ignorant multitude of men, ſo it is not very wel underſtood by all that profeſs themſelves Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For although, as I conceive, it is agreed upon by al Phyſitians, that Blood is the Cauſe of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, yet notwithſtanding leſt that (as the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> writes in the place before allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) we ſhould ſeem only to declare our own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Opinion, without any further enquiry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into; we wil therefore make the more accurate ſearch after (thereby to find out) the Cauſe of an Inflammation, in this manner following. There would be no Tumor at any time generated in any part of the Body, were it not that either its ſubſtance as it were boyling over with heat is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, or that from without ſome new ſubſtance makes its approach. For there are but two only cauſes to be aſſigned of the augmentation of the bulk and quantity in any thing whatſoever. For either the radical moiſture through an internal or external heat is reſolved into an aery ſubſtance, which (as it is wel known) requires a far greater ſpace &amp; room for dilatation then formerly it had; or elſe, as we ſaid before, ſome new ſubſtance is extrinſecally from ſome other place ſuperadded thereunto. Now therefore of neceſſity it is that one of theſe two cauſes muſt be preſent, when as in that hot and burning Tumor which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call a <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> the part is lifted up into a greater bulk than is ordinary, or agreeable to the intention of Nature. But now, that the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency and boyling up of the natural moiſture, or the effuſion thereof, is not the Cauſe, appears by this, becauſe that every thing that is poured forth and converted, as it were, into ſpirits, when it is cooled it aſſumes again its priſtine quantity, and (as we may ſo expreſs it) puts off and laies aſide the Tumor; as by common experience it is moſt apparent. But as for the parts inflamed, let them be never ſo vehemently cooled, yet wil they never return into the former ſtate and condition, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver caſt off the Tumor or Swelling. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, if by reaſon of the effuſion of the part, and its converſion into ſpirits, a Tumor ſhould be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the part inflamed, then neceſſarily upon the inciſion of the part the ſpirit ſhould appear; which yet (as we ſee) is nothing ſo: but that rather there follows an effuſion of Blood; and the whole place by its colour and the looks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſeems altogether full of Blood. It remains therefore, that the acceſſion of ſome new ſubſtance is the cauſe of a <hi>Phlegmone.</hi> But now that this new ſubſtance is the Blood, appears from hence, to wit, that the <hi>Phlegmone</hi> is exceeding red both within and without. Now this red colour is only proper unto, and inſeparable from the Blood;<note place="margin">Blood the nigheſt cauſe of an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> for there is nothing that waxeth red in the Body, beſide the Blood and the Fleſh; which later, notwithſtanding, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fleſh, cannot by any means be the cauſe of a <hi>Phlegmone.</hi> For if the increment of the fleſh were the cauſe of an Inflammation, there would be indeed a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or Swelling in the part; yet ſo as notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the internal heat ſhould remain ſound, and in an healthful plight, without the leaſt diſtemper; and that alſo it ſhould not in the leaſt vary its priſtine nature, when as in no one thing that is augmented according to its ſubſtance the heat may properly be ſaid to be heightned and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo far forth that the increment of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and quantity ſhould any way differ from the change or alteration of the qualities. But now the caſe is otherwiſe in a <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the colour is changed, and the heat grown to be more intenſe, the ſaid colour evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating not only the quantity, but likewiſe the quality of the ſubſtance. Moreover, that the Blood is cauſe of a <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> may be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidenced by this, that the place (in the greateſt Inflammations eſpecially, which now and then happen in Ulcers) appears and ſeems all bloody round about; which certainly would never be, if blood were not the cauſe of the Inflammation. Furthermore, that Blood is Cauſe of the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that generating of the Inflammation which happeneth in Wounds doth evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. For in new and freſh Wounds, the Blood (its true) at the firſt flows forth; but then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being compreſſed and kept in either by the hand, or elſe with Ligatures, or Medicaments that ſtop the iſſuing forth of blood, or elſe laſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppreſſed and ſtaid of its own accord, it is then reteined either in the Orifice or Cavities of the diſſected Veſſels, and there it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, and ſo wrought that it grows together (like as clotted blood uſeth to do) and there by a continued heaping up of the blood abundantly flowing thereunto it lifts up the part into a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or Swelling, and cauſeth an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

In theſe when the matter of the fluxion is forcibly impacted, and cannot therein be any longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, it is then tranſmitted unto the outward parts, partly through their own Orifices, and partly by a percolation, as it were, and ſtraining or ſweating out of it through the Tunicles: and then the void ſpaces which are betwixt the moſt principal parts are filled full with the fluxion. And ſo all thoſe parts or places are on all ſides ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much heated and overſpread. Thoſe parts or Bodies are the Nerves, Ligaments, Membranes, the Fleſh it ſelf, and before al theſe the Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. For whereas the Veins and Arteries run along unto each particular part (by the which is received both nouriſhment and vital Spirit) ſo long as the blood flows in a due meaſure, and juſt proportion, and is conteined within thoſe its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles, the part is not wont to ſuffer any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation at all; but then only, when at the length the blood is overcopiouſly and all on a huddle emptied and poured forth into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the part by the Veins and Arteries. By which very thing alſo a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from other fluxions, in which the matter is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed without the Veins into the whole ſubſtance of the part, and there doth diſtend and dilate it. For in a <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> although all the parts are (as I may ſo ſay) embrued with blood, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there is a certain order obſerved, to wit, that ſome of the parts ſhould ſooner receive the fluxion, and others of them not til afterward; until that at length all of them come to be repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and diſtended by the humor. Now this kind of order wholly depends upon the natural diſtribution of the greater Veſſels conteining the blood. For whereas the Veins and Arteries when they firſt of all make their entrance into the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Veſſels are evermore the larger, and by how much the deeper they are diſtributed thereinto, ſo much the leſs they are; all this while there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth no Inflammation, unleſs it ſo chance that the blood be emptied forth into thoſe ſmalleſt Veins, and again happen to fall out of them. And this that hath been ſaid manifeſtly appears unto thoſe that by an exact and accurate inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on take a right view of thoſe very little and almoſt imperceptible Veins that are branched forth and extended unto that Tunicle of the Eye which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiſts uſually call <hi>Adnate</hi> or <hi>Conjunctive.</hi> For theſe indeed do evermore convey blood unto the Eye for its nouriſhment, and yet notwithſtanding whileſt that the Eye is free from diſtemper they are ſo exceeding ſmal, that they can hardly be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd by the ſharpeſt ſighted Eye. But then ſo ſoon as the Eye is inflamed, &amp; thoſe ſlender Veins are preternaturally repleniſhed with blood, then they ſhew themſelves, and become very conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And it is moſt agreeable to truth that thus it ſhould be alſo in al other Inflammations, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be. But as yet there is no Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſent, albeit the leſſer Veins are even filled up with blood, until that at length by and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row them the blood be derived into the remaining ſubſtance of the parts; which may be done two waies. For in the firſt place, the blood is emptied forth by thoſe very ſmal and moſt inconſiderable orifices of the Veins, by which the Veins do (as it were) gape &amp; open themſelves into the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſtance of the part, that ſo thereby the blood may through them the more eaſily drop forth, for nutrition or nouriſhment. Moreover likewiſe it ſtrains and ſweats through by the Tunicles of the Veins: for even the Tunicles of the Veins are in like manner ſo framed by nature, that they are not without their pores; through which, if not the blood it ſelf, yet certainly the feroſity or wheyi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, and its thinner part is ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>From what hath been hitherunto ſpoken, the diſtinction of the conjunct cauſe from the cauſe meerly antecedent in an Inflammation is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently apparent. For the blood (which we have aſſerted to be the cauſe of a <hi>Phlegmone</hi>) doth in a double reſpect take upon it ſelf the virtue and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a cauſe. For either it is the next conteining and conjunct cauſe, of which we have hitherto diſcourſed; to wit, as it hath already flown into the part, and is irremovably impacted therein, ſo far forth that it actually elevates that ſame part into a Tumor: or elſe it is the antecedent foregoing cauſe, to wit,<note place="margin">The antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cauſe of an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> as by reaſon of its abounding in the body it hath a power of ſlowing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and by its influx of lifting up the part into a Tumor or Swelling. The which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Cauſe in an Inflammation, like as alſo in other Tumors, fals again under a twofold conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: to wit, either in regard of the Affect ſimply conſidered as it is to follow upon this cauſe which it hath a power to excite, although as yet it hath no being in the body. And ſo a Pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (which is an extream and overgreat fulneſs of good and laudable blood) is very frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the body, albeit an Inflammation doth not inſtantly enſue thereupon. Or elſe ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is conſiderable, as preceding and foregoing the affect that already hath a being, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready actually exiſtent in the Body; to wit, when as the Blood now floweth to the exciting and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
<pb n="2424" facs="tcp:49110:16"/> of the Tumor. Which (to ſpeak truth) is more rightly ſtiled the antecedent cauſe, then was the former; ſince that this latter hath reſpect unto an effect already preſent; but the former relates only unto an affect which hapneth in the future time. But this antecedent cauſe, that it may flow together unto the place affected, it is thereunto moved and ſtirred up by other means; whilſt that it is either tranſmitted from ſome where elſe; or elſe attracted by the part it ſelf, for thoſe very cauſes we have hitherto been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of and explaining.</p>
                     <p>But now for thoſe Cauſes which we commonly term Procatartick,<note place="margin">The remote Cauſes.</note> more remote, and primitive, they are ſuch as either conduce to the breeding of a copious and a plentiful blood (as do al meats of good and much juyce) an eaſie and idle kind of life, and other ſuch like requiſites: Or elſe they are ſuch as render the blood more acrimonious and ſharp, as do all things that cauſe heat, al acid and tart aliments, wrath, watchings, ſtirrings, and exerciſes in the extreme, or elſe ſuch as excite and ſtir up the blood to move unto the part affected, as doth the overgreat heat of the part, pain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a wound, from a fall, from contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or beating, from a fracture, from disjoyntures, and the like cauſes; or elſe the weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity of the part affected receiving, compared and conſidered in reference to the vigour and ſtrength of thoſe other parts which tranſmit the abundant ſtore of hot blood unto the aggrieved part. Notwithſtanding, an Inflammation never happeneth to be generated by a leiſurely and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual ſtoring up of blood; but it is evermore bred by a ſudden and thronging affluence and influx of the ſaid blood. For although it may ſo chance, that ſome kind of Humor may ſenſibly and by degrees be collected in ſome one part, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heaped up, as aforeſaid, may afterward begin to excite a certain kind of pain in the part; yet notwithſtanding al this, an Inflammation is never produced until ſuch time as the pain gives cauſe ſufficient that a more plenteous ſtore of blood ſhould forthwith and very eaſily make its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding we are to take notice, That although the Blood be the containing and antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cauſe of an Inflammation, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we ſay, that a Cacochymy, or a depraved ill digeſtion, and more eſpecially ſharp and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick humors, are the prime and principal cauſe that the blood be moved unto the part affected, in thoſe Inflammations which are excited without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny apparent cauſe, as Wounds, Contuſions, and ſuch like. For ſo it is, That when Nature is twinged and pulled by ſuch like Humors, and yet notwithſtanding is unable altogether to expel them out of the body, to the end that ſhe may free the principal parts from the danger impending by reaſon of them, ſhe aſſays to thruſt them forth unto the external and leſs principal parts: the which when it is not able to accompliſh, unleſs it make uſe of the blood for a vehicle or (as we ſay) a Conduit-pipe of conveyance; and that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimonious humor it ſelf excites a pain in that part into which it is thruſt and ſhut up; hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is that there follows a conflux of blood unto that part, and from it proceeds an Inflammation. And much after this manner, the Pleuriſie, the <hi>Peripneumonia</hi> or the Inflammation and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume of the Lungs, the Quinſie, the Phrenſie, the Inflammation of the Ears and Gums, the hot Tumors or Swellings in the groins called <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones,</hi> Carbuncles, and ſuch like are generated and excited.</p>

                     <p>The principal Differences of an Inflammation are taken from the variety of the containing cauſe, and from the great difference of the blood that ſtirs up and begets the Inflammation. For a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> is ſaid to be (for diſtinctions ſake) either that which is a true and legitimate one, or otherwiſe that that is not a true <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> but rather a baſtard and ſpurious one. The true and legitimate <hi>Phlegmone</hi> is that which proceeds from good blood, and ſuch as is in a due natural temper, or at leaſtwiſe ſuch as whereof there is more than ordinary ſtore: and this is abſolutely and ſimply termed a <hi>Phlegmone.</hi> But the ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and counterfeit <hi>Phlegmone</hi> is that which hath its riſe and original from corrupt and vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted blood, and ſuch as ſwerves from its natural temperament; and this may be occaſioned two manner of waies: for if the blood doth neither loſe its nature, nor change its ſubſtance; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath mingled together with it ſome other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, then there are three baſtard ſpurious ſorts of an Inflammation that thence ariſe.

                     <p>The Signs of Inflammation (as may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of its definition) are, heat, pain, a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſtretching out of the part, a renitency or Reſiſtance, a redneſs of color, and a pulſation or beating.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And in the firſt place, in this kind of Tumor
<pb n="2425" facs="tcp:49110:16"/> there is preſent ſo intenſe a heat, that from it the Tumor hath its very name and denomination; and many indeed are the cauſes wherefore this heat is neceſſarily raiſed and ſtirred up. For firſt of all, the blood that through its overgreat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance excites the <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> is hot, which heat it alſo communicates to the part affected. Moreover, whenas by the plenty of blood, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes likewiſe by a certain kind of thickneſs al the pores are ſo filled up and obſtructed that the hot exhalations cannot ſufficiently be ſent forth and evaporated, neither the heat eventilated or cooled as is ought to be, the heat by retention of theſe exhalations and fuliginous vapors is much encreaſed. Unto which alſo a third cauſe may be added, to wit, putrefaction: for the blood contained in the inflamed part aſſumes at length a putredinous quality, by which (as is to be ſeen likewiſe in other things) the heat is exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and communicated unto the part inflamed. And this heat is ſomtimes greater, ſomtimes leſs, according to the greatneſs and growth of thoſe cauſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſign is Pain: for whereas there are two remarkable cauſes of pain, an <hi>Intemperies</hi> or diſtemper, and the ſolution of continuity, they both of them take place in Inflammations. For in truth this extraordinary heat by its diſtemper firſt of all excites pain: and then the abundance of blood by filling ful and diſtending the part diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth continuity, and thus doing is the cauſe of this pain. Again, the pain that is thus cauſed is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious &amp; much different, viz. diſtending or ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, pulling or twinging, preſſing and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening, according to the variety of the parts affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: but more eſpecially there is preſent a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pain, which likewiſe for this very reaſon is peculiarly reckoned up amongſt the proper ſigns of a <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> and of which more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, a Diſtenſion. For when the plentiful ſtore of blood doth not only fill the Veins and Arteries, but even the whol ſubſtance of the part, all things are now diſtended and ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out, but chiefly the skin; the which as it lieth round about al the other parts, and hath a Membranous ſubſtance, muſt neceſſarily partake of the diſtenſion, and the extenſive pain.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Renitency or reſiſtance, or (as the Grecians cal it) <hi>Antitupia,</hi> in like manner follows upon this repletion and diſtenſion. For albeit the inflamed part be not hard in its own nature, yet it is ſo ſtuffed out, and diſtended with ſtore of blood, that now it wil no longer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the touch, neither yield thereunto, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and withſtand it; and withal it appears hard unto the touch.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Fiftly, the parts inflamed wax red, the blood imparting this color unto them. For there is nothing in mans body that aſſumes this redneſs of color, beſides the blood and fleſh.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And laſtly, In the ſixth place, there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the inflamed parts a Pulſe and beating pain, to wit, when with grief and extream irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs there is perceived a bearing of the Artery in the inflamed part, which while the part was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound was not to be perceived. From whence we are inſtructed (as <hi>Galen</hi> writes in his ſixt Book of the parts affected, Chap. 7.) that this beating pain doth not happen unto al the parts, but only to ſuch of them as have in them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain notable and remarkable Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<note place="margin">The heating pain how it is cauſed.</note> and that have a part endued with an exquiſite ſenſe; and when the Inflammation is raiſed up unto a magnitude worthy of obſervation. Now this Pulſatory or beating pain chanceth from hence, that when they are lifted up and diſtended, the parts inflamed by reaſon of their ſtore of blood do not allow nor afford a due, free, and ſufficient room unto the Artery now diſtending it ſelf, but that themſelves are rather ſtretched out by the Artery lifting it ſelf up; which ſaid diſtenſion excites the pain. And this pulſatory pain is then moſt of al perceived, whenas the Inflammation tendeth toward a ſuppuration. For then the blood boyls as it were, and grows exceeding hot; from whence it alſo comes to paſs, that it aſſumes and makes uſe of a larger ſpace of room, and ſo much the more diſtends the part; by the which part the Artery is henceforth much preſſed &amp; kept down in its motion, which we cal <hi>Diaſtole;</hi> and then afterward hereupon the Artery likewiſe compreſſeth and bears down the adjacent and neer neighboring parts that lie round about it.</p>

                  <div type="prognosis">
                     <head>The Prognoſticks.</head>
                     <p>In an Inflammation there are two things that it mainly and principally behoves us to preſage, to wit,<note place="margin">
                           <p>The termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>Which is threefold.</p>
                        </note> its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or termination, and then the exact and punctual time of the ſaid termination. Now the Event is ſaid to be good, when Nature overcometh the matter that breeds the Inflammation, which hapneth when either the Tumor is reſolved, and the matter inſenſibly exhaled (which is the beſt kind of ſolution of an Inflammation) or elſe when the matter is ſuppurated and turned into that which we term <hi>Pus,</hi> being a thick and puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter. Or otherwiſe, ſecondly, The event may be ſaid to be evil, or if ye wil, worſt of all, when Nature doth not overcome and maſter he peccant matter; which hapneth when the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation (if it be external) ſuddenly vaniſheth and retires back to the internal parts; or when the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat being overcome and extinguiſhed, the Member thereupon becomes putrified and ſeized upon by a Gangrene, inſomuch that if it be not forthwith cut off, ruine and death it ſelf threaten the whol body. Or elſe in the third place, there follows a Neutral Event (as ſome cal it) which is abſolutely evil; when the Tumor is hardened, and when upon the reſolution and diſcuſſion of
<pb n="2426" facs="tcp:49110:17"/> the thinner parts (the more thick and groſs parts remaining behind) the Inflammation degenerates into a <hi>Scirrhus.</hi> But now, which of theſe events is to be hoped for or expected, may probably be gueſſed at by comparing together the vigour and ſtrength of Nature with the matter that cauſeth the Diſeaſe. For if the matter be not overmuch, not thick, not over deeply ſcituated, not ſhut up under a hard and thick skin; if the body be not greatly impure, and Nature be ſtrong, then a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and an evacuation by an inſenſible tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration may be hoped for. But if the matter more abound, be more than ordinary thick, be contained in a deeper place than uſually, and be pent up under a thicker skin, then a ſuppuration is to be expected. That the matter is retreated unto the inward parts may be conjectured by this token, to wit, When we perceive the Tumor to be diminiſhed, albeit there were no repulſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies adminiſtred and applied, to drive back the matter. That the extinction and overthrow of the heat is neer approaching may be preſaged by this, whenas the heat, redneſs of color, pain, and the pulſe or beating is leſſened, the Tumor not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſtill remaining; touching which more hereafter, when we ſhal come to treat of a Gangrene. But then laſtly, an Inflammation for the moſt part then degenerates into a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> when the matter is over viſcous and clammy, and hard therewithal; and when the Natural heat being ſtrong and vigorous, forthwith even in the very beginning of the diſtemper remedies that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs and diſſipate over forcibly are thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; which ſaid remedies diſperſe and ſcatter the thinner parts thereof, and leave the thicker ſtill remaining.</p>
                     <p>That the time of the Event may be known,<note place="margin">The times of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it is requiſite that the times of the Inflammation be firſt of all known; and they are likewiſe heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be obſerved by us (upon our knowledg of them) in relation unto the Cure. For unleſs the times of an Inflammation be well known and conſidered, we may ſoon run our ſelves into an Error, whilſt we adminiſter and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Remedies that are any waies improper or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous unto any one particular of thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times. Now then, Inflammations (like as all other Tumors and Diſeaſes) have four times or periods; its beginning, encreaſe, ſtate or perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and its decay or declination. It commenceth or begins when the parts are repleniſhed with blood, and when the ſwelling, pain, and ſtretching out are encreaſed, this we cal the augmentation.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate or perfection is then, when the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, Diſtenſion, Pain, and all the other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes are moſt vehement, and in the heighth of their extremity. And laſtly, the declination is then ſaid to be, when the matter generating the Tumor is diminiſhed, and the pain, heat, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the other ſymptoms are become more remiſs and gentle; or otherwiſe the matter is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into <hi>Pus</hi> or purulent matter.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, theſe times are ſome while ſhorter, ſomtimes longer; and the Inflammations are ſomtimes ſooner, and ſomtimes more ſlowly terminated. For (as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in the ſixth Book of the Aphoriſms, Aphor. 49.) that which is of a thinner ſubſtance is in a ſhorter ſpace dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; and that which is thick or tough requires a longer time for its digeſtion; but that which is thick and viſcous requires a far longer time. And that Inflammation which hath ſeated it ſelf in the fleſhy parts is terminated according to the period of acute Diſeaſes, to wit, fourteen daies: for the ſubſtance of the fleſh is more ſoft and permeable, by reaſon of its thinneſs. But the ſubſtance of the Ligaments, Tendons, and Nerves, being more thick and hard, and thereupon with greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty receiving the fluxion, for the ſame cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth with more difficulty diſcharge it ſelf ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and hereupon the Inflammation in thoſe parts is the longer time ere it attain unto its ſtate and perfection, and is not ſo ſoon curable: but yet notwithſtanding the Cure is in this caſe ſeldom or never prorogued beyond the term of fourty daies; if both the Phyſitian rightly in al points diſcharge his part; and likewiſe the patient be in al things willing to ſubmit.</p>

                     <head>The Indications and Cure.</head>
                     <p>Whereas the containing cauſe of an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the blood, which hath preternaturally (<hi>i. e.</hi> beyond or beſides Natures intention) flown in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the part, the Cure is effected if that blood be removed out of the diſeaſed part; and then great caution be had that it thenceforth flow no more unto the part affected; that ſo by this means, as wel the containing as the antecedent cauſe may be wholly taken away. For whenas the affect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be removed, without a firſt removal of that which cauſeth it; and the caſe ſo ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the cauſes ought to be taken away in the very ſame order that they follow one the other in; therefore we ſay that the Fluxion muſt firſt of all be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated.<note place="margin">The Cure of a fluxion or flowing of the blood.</note> Now this intention may be accompliſhed, if care be taken to prevent the bloods abounding in the body, and that that which is there in great plenty flow not unto the part affected;<note place="margin">The benefit of blood-letting in an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and this with moſt ſafety and ſpeed is to be effected by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Vein. For by this Veneſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or blood-letting the great ſtore of abounding blood is diminiſhed, and the ſame is likewiſe drawn back from the aggrieved place: hence it is, that there is an exceeding great benefit ariſing from, and following upon this opening of a vein, in an Inflammation; ſo that it is ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be omitted, if the ſtrength of the patient wil permit it to be done. And indeed hardly can any other Remedies with ſafety in this caſe be applied,
<pb n="2430" facs="tcp:49110:17"/> unleſs opening a Vein have the precedence, and the abundance of blood be thereby diminiſhed. For if we adminiſter remedies to drive back, the body ſtil continuing full of blood, it is greatly to be feared leſt that the matter ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the other parts, and thereupon that it ſhould altogether attempt a flowing unto ſome one or other certain particular part. And as for digeſtives, hot as they are, if they ſhould be made uſe of in a body that is full, there might be juſt cauſe to doubt leſt that there ſhould be more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attracted then diſcuſſed and diſſipated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Moreover alſo, albeit a <hi>Cacochymy</hi> or ill digeſtion and bad nutriment be not the cauſe of an Inflammation; yet notwithſtanding, ſince it is a very rare thing to find a Body that is altogether free from this ſaid <hi>Cacochymie,</hi> it wil be very requiſite to ordain a Purgation; which compleated, other Medicaments alſo are afterward to be adminiſtred, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of more ſucceſs and greater benefit. And as we hinted to you before, although Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations take their Original principally from the blood, yet notwithſtanding vitious humors very frequently give an occaſion of their being, as alſo doth the aforeſaid <hi>Cacochymie;</hi> and indeed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the hot humors challenge the firſt place. For if by theſe Nature be at any time ſtir'd up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, and it be ſo that ſhe cannot of her ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them, then ſhe endeavors to thruſt them forth by ſome and ſome unto the other parts: but when ſhe fals ſhort in the effecting of this alſo (unleſs ſhe ſhould withall tranſmit the blood thither) and that by an acrimonious humor ſent unto the part a pain is excited; hereupon a conflux of the blood unto that ſame part into which Nature aſſaies to empty forth the vitious humor, is cauſed; and ſo conſequently an Inflammation is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And from hence it is alſo, that from a <hi>Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymie</hi> there is very frequently produced a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, an Inflammation or Impoſtume of the Lungs, the Squinancy or (as we uſe to term it) the Quinſie, and that kind of madneſs which we commonly call the Phrenſie.</p>
                     <p>Moreover alſo the blood is abated, and no exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſtore thereof bred in the body, if that meat be not taken in which either by its overgreat propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe by reaſon of its ſubſtance, afford too much nouriſhment, and exceedingly conduceth to the generating a more plentiful ſtore of blood than is requiſite. Wherefore let the ſick Perſon abſtain from Wine, and let him uſe a ſparing and ſlender Diet, which both hindreth the breeding of much blood; and if it be already over-much, doth by little and little leſſen it.</p>
                     <p>But that the blood may not flow to the part affected, it may be prevented, if we deprive it of that which neceſſity requires that it ſhould have to help forward and facilitate its motion; and if we likewiſe correct the thinneſs thereof, together with its overmuch aptneſs to motion; if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and ſtreighten the paſſages through which it ought to be moved; and if we recall and draw it back from the part affected. The blood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it may be withheld from flowing unto the part affected, is to be altered, driven back, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, and derived unto ſome other place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Alteration of the blood.</note>The Alteration of the blood is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neceſſary, that ſo, if it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhot, thin, and fluxile or movable, it may be cooled, thickned, and rendred more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt and leſs prone to motion: and this Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the moſt part we ought the rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in regard of the Feaver, which almoſt ever accompanieth the Phlegmone, or heat of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For it is a rare thing, that they which are infeſted with an Inflammation of any part ſhould yet not be ſenſible of a Feaver. Wherefore we muſt uſe Medicaments made of <hi>Succory, Endive, Violets, Lettice, Sorrel, Barley,</hi> the greater cold Seeds, the juyce of Citron, of Pomegranates, and ſuch like. And if the blood be more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily hot and thin, we ought alſo then to add thoſe things that have in them an aſtringent quality; and ſuch are Roſes, Purſlane, Plantane, and the like. But here notwithſtanding we ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to look to it, leſt that the Veins being nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and overſtreightned, or there being obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Bowels, by the uſe of theſe or ſuch like aſtringents more obſtructions ſhould be bred or increaſed.</p>
                     <p>And then again, we ought not only to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter contrary Medicaments for the altering of the blood; but likewiſe to remove from the Patient, and cauſe him to omit and forbear the uſe of ſuch things as either introduce or augment thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities whoſe abſence we now require, as being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than their company. For inſtance, a hot Air is to be ſhun'd, ſurfeits with over-eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king muſt be avoided, and Wine forborn; or if any be drank, it muſt be that which is weak and wel diluted; all kind of violent motion is to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reſt rather to be indulged; Wrath and venereal Embracements ought likewiſe here care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided and abſtained from.</p>
                     <p>Revulſion or drawing back ought moreover to be ordained,<note place="margin">Revulſion or drawing back.</note> and the humor is to be turn'd away unto a contrary place, that is, we muſt ſo order it, that a contrary motion may be procured unto the humor, and that it may move unto that part unto which it naturally tends; ſo that it may not flow unto the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.

                        </gap>imes written upon this ſubject; and if we take a right view of the conditions that are requiſite in a Revulſion. But that <hi>Galen</hi> by the word [Contrary] underſtood nothing elſe but the parts contrary, that is, far diſtant and remote from the part affected, is every where manifeſted in his own writings: for thus he argueth in his fourth of the meth. of Phyſick Chap. 6. If it be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſtanding rule (as we have learn'd from him, viz. from <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) that a fluxion if but beginning is to be drawn to the contraries, but if already fixed in the aggrieved particle, it is then to be evacuated, either from the particle it ſelf which is afflicted, or elſe from that which is next neighboring unto it; we may now hence readily conclude, as to the point of this blood-letting, that at firſt (<hi>i. e.</hi> in the beginning of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) it ought to be attempted from a far off, but afterwards from the affected parts themſelves. Now what kind of remoteneſs, and what ſort of longitude he underſtands, is explained in his fifth of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 3. A Revulſion (ſaith he) ought alwaies to be carried downward in thoſe affects which are upward; and upward evermore in thoſe that are below: and moreover alſo the Revulſion ought to be made from the right ſide unto thoſe on the left; and again in like manner, from thoſe unto theſe: and ſembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, from thoſe places that are internal unto ſuch as are outwardly ſcituate; and on the contrary, from theſe unto thoſe. For when as the main ſcope of Revulſion is, not to evacuate thoſe humors which are already conteined in the part affected, but thoſe rather that are flowing thereunto; and ſeeing it reſpects rather the part ſending the blood, than that which receives it: from theſe premiſes it neceſſarily follows, that queſtionleſs this is required in every revulſion, to wit, that it ſhould by all means procure a motion contrary unto that which flows, that ſo it may not any longer be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto the part affected; and for this cauſe, the revulſion muſt not be ordain'd either from the grieved part, or from that next unto it; but rather from the oppoſite, yea (and ſo far forth as poſſible it may be) from the places moſt remote from the affected part. And hence alſo it is that every oppoſition doth not conſtitute a contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, neither hath every kind of oppoſition any place in a Revulſion; but thoſe oppoſitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone which <hi>Galen</hi> (in the before alleadged third Chapter of the fifth Book of his Method of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick) recites; to wit, upward and downward, from the right ſide parts unto the left, from the places that are within unto thoſe that are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and ſo on the contrary. Yet if there be only but a very ſmal inconſiderable diſtance, we cannot ſafely nor conveniently draw back from the parts more inward to thoſe more externally ſcituate, but then only when the diſtance is greater. But that oppoſition which is from before and behind, or according to the fore parts and hinder parts, hath no place in this kind of Revulſion, which is ſo called ſingly and abſolutely. For neither if any affect ſhal chance to be in the backward part of the Head, are the Forehead Veins forthwith to be opened, by way of revulſion, ſince that may not be done (without manifeſt danger) during the continuance of the Plethory, and flowing of the humors. But enough hath been ſaid of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion in the fifth Book of Inſtitutions, Part 2. Sect. 1. Chap. 18.</p>
                     <p>But that we may in few words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract whatſoever hath there more at large been ſpoken,<note place="margin">Revulſion twofold:</note> and whatever elſe may be ſaid upon this ſubject; it is in the firſt place to be taken notice of, that Revulſion is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, one, which is accompliſhed together with the evacuation of the humor, ſuch as is that which is effected by Blood-letting, and Cupping-Glaſſes with Scarification; the other which is wrought without the evacuation of the humor, ſuch as is that which is performed by Frictions or Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings, Ligatures, and Cupping-Glaſſes without Scarification. This latter is never to be practiſed but when the Revulſion is to be made unto the parts moſt remote, ſince that if it be inſtituted in the neer adjacent parts, then the humor which is only ſtirred, and not totally evacuated, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty or reſiſtance ruſh upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected part. And it is very rare, and ſcarcely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known, that this kind of revulſion hath place or any thing to do in an Inflammation, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a manifeſt, ſenſible, and ſuddain evacuation of the blood.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">Revulſion by opening of a Vein:</note> as for what concerns Revulſion which is effected by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Vein, this one thing at leaſt is to be obſerved (which if it be wel heeded, many intricate controverſies touching the thing now in queſtion may be determined) to wit, that the utmoſt endeavor muſt be uſed that a contrary motion may be procured unto the blood, and that (as much as poſſibly may be) drawn back unto that Fountain from whence it flows. And ſince that the Liver is the Fountain and Sourſe of the blood, and that the greateſt ſtore of the blood is conteined in the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> or great hollow Vein nigh about the Liver, we muſt do our utmoſt, that the blood which flows into the inflamed part may be drawn back towards its Spring-head; yea alſo if it be poſſible, unto the oppoſite part, yet notwithſtanding ſo, that the blood which flows may be retracted and drawn back. And therfore in every Revulſion this at leaſt is to be wrought, that the blood may obtain ſuch a motion, as that by it the part affected may not be
<pb n="2429" facs="tcp:49110:18"/> injured by its immoderate conflux, but that it may rather be again recalled from the diſeaſed part. But how this may be effected in every part, here to declare unto you would be a buſineſs too tedious; beſides, we have already elſewhere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to this very point, in our treating of particular affects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Revulſion when to be ordained, &amp; after what manner.</note>And by what hath been ſaid (as I conjecture) it is ſufficiently appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, how and in what manner a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion is to be ordained in caſe of an Inflammation; ſo that there wil not be any great need, that we ſhould add much as touching the right and due adminiſtration thereof. For whereas revulſion is then only ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and proper unto the Humors when they flow, and unto them alone, and not unto thoſe which have done flowing, and have ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the part affected; it is hence manifeſt, that it ought to be inſtituted and appointed in the very firſt riſe of the diſtemper. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this is not ſo to be underſtood, as if in the firſt appearing of an Inflammation we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to put revulſion in practice; for if either there be no great ſtore of blood, or if its ruſhing in upon the part be not over violent and impetuous, Medicaments that drive back and derive will be ſufficient. But then only is Revulſion to be put in practice, when there is great plenty of blood, and a more than uſual violent and forcible ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof unto the part affected: and according to the greater or leſs proportion of this abundant blood, and the more or leſs vehemency of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo anſwerably ought the Remedies and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments that are preſcribed for Revulſories or drawers back, to be ordained ſo much the more or leſs ſtrong and forcible. But now that Revulſion which is made with an effuſion or emptying forth of the matter muſt needs be greater than that which is made without it. But amongſt all the Remedies which we term Revulſories or drawers back, the moſt prevalent and efficacious, is, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of a Vein; which ſaid Veneſection doth more effectually, or leſs ſtrongly draw back, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as the Veins that are opened be greater or leſs. The greater Veins are to be opened whiles the blood flows with greater violence, and (as we may ſay) with a more impetuous motion; and the leſſer, when the Fluxion of the blood is leſs forcible and impetuous. For it is behoveful that the Remedies ſhould be ſuch as may by their celerity or ſwiftneſs contend with the over haſty motion of the matter. And therefore we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <hi>Fernelius</hi> to be in the right, in his ſecond Book of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 7. where he writes, That the opening of the Shoulder Vein in the Elbow doth very conveniently draw back al the affects of the Head, as wel internal as external, ariſing from fulneſs; if they be on the right ſide, the right Vein; but if on the left ſide, the left Shoulder Vein is in the Elbow to be opened. But if this be to be done more deliberately and ſlowly, as to inſtance, when the intention and main drift is only to anticipate and prevent future Diſeaſes, then that Vein in the Hand which runs directly unto the Thumb and fore Finger is to be opened, unleſs haply it take its original from elſwhere, and not from the Shoulder Vein. But for thoſe diſtempers which are ſeated betwixt the Channel bone and the Kidneys, the more inward Vein in the Elbow being opened doth more ſpeedily and with greater force draw back from them; but more ſlowly and dully that Vein in the branch of the Hand, which is extended and ſtretched forth between the Ring-finger, and the little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>Repulſion or driving back is uſed to follow revulſion.<note place="margin">Repulſion or driving back.</note> For Repulſion and Revulſion as it were mutually aſſiſt each other; and hence it is that both theſe Remedies are to be adminiſtred in great Inflammations; yet notwithſtanding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion ought alwaies to have the precedence. For Repelling Remedies that drive back may not ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be adminiſtred while the body continues full, ſince that the Veſſels yet remaining ful wil hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give way unto the Humor that is driven back; but if Revulſion be firſt made uſe of, where there is occaſion for it, afterwards thoſe things that drive back may with more ſafety be adminiſtred. For Repellers both drive back the flowing humor unto ſome other part, and ſo permit not the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage thereof into the diſtempered part; and they alſo likewiſe repreſs the humor which is newly flown into it, and which ſticks in the Capillary Veſſels; and ſo by this means they free the part affected from that overgreat abundance of blood. But albeit the benefit ariſing from theſe Repelling Remedies be very great and evident, as that whereby the fluxions even in their beginning (by the alone uſe of theſe Repellers) are ſtopped, and the part which began to be lift up into a Tumor again fals down from its Swelling; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe ought not evermore in al caſes to be adminiſtred. For (that we may not again repeat what we ſaid before, to wit, that driving back be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits nothing in a full and foul body, but that likewiſe it cannot then be ſo much as attempted without danger)<note place="margin">When Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that drive back are not to be made uſe of.</note> it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improper and unfit to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thoſe things that drive back, when a far greater diſcommodity and inconvenience may be feared from the repulſion or driving back of the blood, than from the Inflammation it ſelf; which may very wel be, firſt, if the humor be malignant, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous, and peſtilent; the which if Nature ſhal thruſt forth from the inward parts unto the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we ought not to drive it back again unto the internal parts, leſt that it ſhould (peradventure) make its retreat back unto thoſe inward parts, and thereby encreaſe the diſeaſe, and indanger the
<pb n="2427" facs="tcp:49110:19"/> choaking of the man. Which very Caution is likewiſe to be obſerved in every other humor (be it what it wil) that Nature (rightly acting in a critical way) rejects and caſts forth into any ſome one part. For Nature while it is rightly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and buſied is by no means to be impeded in her operation. Secondly, Thoſe things that drive back are not ſafely to be adminiſtred in the parts which we term ignoble, or leſs conſiderable, being ſuch as Nature hath ordained to receive the ſuperfluities of the more noble Parts; unto which ſhe is oftentimes wont to thruſt out the Humors with which the more noble parts are burdened and even loaded; and ſuch are the <hi>Glandules</hi> or Kernels in the Groins, Arm-pits, and behind the Ears. For if repelling Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be applied unto theſe parts, there will be great cauſe to fear, leſt the matter ſhould again retire to the more noble and principal parts. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, thirdly, There are other places, and other parts likewiſe, unto the which Repellers may not commodiouſly be applied; and ſuch are al thoſe that in their ſcituation too neerly neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor upon the noble parts: For the very ſame thing (as before ſaid) is to be feared, leſt that the matter being driven back ſhould invade ſome of the nobler parts, and create a greater miſchief. In the fourth and laſt place, Repelling Remedies are not then to be tampered with, when the parts are ſcituated in a place too profound, or over deep. For neither doth the vertue (as we cal it) and ſtrength of the Repelling Medicaments reach unto ſuch parts; neither can it wel be prevented, but that thoſe parts are hereby rather made more ful, than any waies emptied. For while by Repelling Remedies the exterior parts are contracted, and from out of them the Humors are driven inwards, they are (after a ſort) thruſt and obtruded upon the affected part, the which by this means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more repleniſhed.</p>

To wit, ſeeing that the main end and ſcope of driving back is this, That the flowing humor ſhould be prohibited its paſſage, and rejected, therefore they are to be preſcribed in the very beginning, and that moſt rightly and properly whileſt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is yet flowing. But this notwithſtanding ought evermore carefully to be obſerved, as we ſaid before, that the body be not ful. For if the body yet remain ful, drivers back are not ſafely adminiſtred, whenas the blood hath not any free paſſage for its retreat, and ſo by this means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes either more impacted into the part, or elſe ruſheth into ſome more noble part, and ſo create a greater danger. But when indeed (even whileſt it is in its augmentation) there is yet ſome of the blood in flowing, even then repelling Medicaments may be adminiſtred, yet not alone; whereupon we judg it not amiſs, that unto theſe we add and mingle therewithal ſome kind of Digeſtives, to the end that by the heat ſomwhat may together alſo be attenuated, and converted into exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The quality of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that repell or drive back.</note>Furthermore, that in our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe we may make our approach, and come cloſely to ſpeak of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Medicamental matter it ſelf, all repelling Remedies are cold; as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> aſſerts in his fifth Book touching the making of ſimple Medicaments, Chap. 17. For like as heat attracts and draws, ſo that (whatever it be) that is cold repels or drives back from it ſelf. But then, look as whatever is hot is not in or of it ſelf the principle of the local motion, or attraction, but only as we uſe to ſay, <hi>per accidens,</hi> or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally; to wit, as it reſolves into vapors the matter that is moiſt, in the room and place whereof (leſt a vacuity ſhould happen and follow thereupon, which Nature evermore abhors, and wil by no means admit of) thoſe things that are neer neighboring do afterward ſucceed: ſo in like manner, that which is cold doth not of it ſelf drive back, but accidentally, to wit, as it cauſeth a conſtriction; by which motion of conſtriction the thicker parts do coaleſce and ſeat themſelves cloſe together, but the thinner are preſſed forth. But then that coldneſs hath adjoyned with it ſomtimes humidity or moiſtneſs, and ſomtimes its contrary, ſiccity or drineſs. And hence it is, that of ſuch Remedies as drive back there are two ſorts or kinds:<note place="margin">Repellers twofold</note> one moiſt and cold, or wateriſh; the other cold and dry, or earthy; and as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in the Book next before alleadged, it hath conjoyned with it a thickneſs of the parts. Such as are of the latter ſort, ſince that beſides their coldneſs they have likewiſe an aſtringent power, they therefore with a double force, as by their coldneſs, ſo alſo by their aſtringent faculty, do the more ſtrongly and vigorouſly repel and drive back. But then thoſe cold and moiſt Repellers are more mild and gentle, which therefore have power only to drive back the thin humors that are ſeated in the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, and then alſo when there is no great ſtore of them; and they are commodiouſly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred when heat and pain afflicts the part. For they do not only oppoſe and reſiſt the influx of the humors, but they alſo allay the heat, and by relaxation do ſomthing mitigate and aſſwage the pain. But Repellers with aſtriction are proper in other caſes; and chiefly if the fluxion proceed from the debility of the parts, and that the pain be not over urgent. For they ſtrengthen the part receiving, that ſo it may not receive the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor flowing into it, and they drive back that which hath already flown in. And they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit likewiſe, if the Veſſels through which the blood floweth be wide and large, like as when the Veſſels are ſmal and ſtreight the gentler ſort of Repellers are ſufficient. Of the former kind are, Houſleek, Wall-Penywort, Lettice, Purſlane, Endive, Nightſhade, the juyce of Gourds, Water Lentils, Fleawort, Water-lilly, Arrach, Violets, and al other Medicaments that are cold, and which are indued with a Watry humor. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding even among theſe themſelves there are alſo certain degrees; and ſome of them have a greater, ſome a leſs efficacy. Wall-Pennywort and Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort drive back leſs forcibly than Lettice, Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leek, Purſlane, and Nightſhade.</p>
                     <p>Repellers with aſtriction are, the flowers and heads of Roſes, the Leaves of the Bramble buſh, Vine Leaves, Saunders, Medlers, the fruit of the Service Tree, Wild Pears, Quinces, the Leaves and Fruit of the Myrtle Tree, Pomegranate flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Frankincenſe, the Rinds of Pomegranates, Acacia, Bole Armenick, Earth of Lemnos (called <hi>Terra ſigillata</hi> or ſealed Earth) Dragons blood, the Leaves and Nuts of the Cypreſs Tree, Oak Leaves, unripe Galls, Ceruſs, Litharge, Corals.</p>
                     <p>Out of theſe there are compounded divers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments (which you ſhal anon find expreſſed) according to the diverſity of the diſeaſe it ſelf, and its circumſtances. For of the Plants, either the crude raw Leaves themſelves are impoſed upon the grieved part; or otherwiſe if by reaſon of their roughneſs this ſhal not be deemed convenient then let them be boyled in water, in the which let linen cloaths be dipt, or elſe ſpunges throughly ſoaked, and ſo let them be laid upon the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Or elſe the juyce is preſſed forth, and applied in the ſame manner. But others of them are bruiſed, and then mingled with Liquors are applied in a different manner. <hi>Galen</hi> was wont to dip a ſpunge and wet it wel in an Oxycrate, that is, a compound of Vinegar mingled with ſome other Liquor, and then to apply it unto the part. To the ſame end and purpoſe are convenient the Oyl of Roſes and Myrtles, the Unguent of Roſes, the cooling Santaline Cerecloath preſcribed by <hi>Galen.</hi> And this likewiſe that followeth is an excellent Remedy, and in frequent uſe with Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, viz.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Whites of Eggs, and Roſewater, of each alike; let theſe be well ſhaken, and throughly mingled together; then let Linen Clouts be wel wet and ſoaked therein, and ſo laid upon the part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, Take <hi>Barley Meal, which boyl in Vinegar and the juyce of Plantane, and lay it upon the grieved part. Galen</hi> in his ſecond Book to <hi>Glauco,</hi> Chap. 2. commends a Cataplaſm of Houſleek, Pomegranate Rinds boyled with Wine, and ſo made up with Sumach and Barley Meal. For this Cataplaſm (as ſaith <hi>Galen</hi>) is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beſt in ſuch like affects; and alſo very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to al thoſe purpoſes we intend it for.

                     <p>And laſt of all, we may alſo in this place make uſe of derivation,<note place="margin">Derivation.</note> which hath reſpect unto the blood that hath indeed already flown in, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as yet is only poured forth without the Veins into the void ſpaces of the part, but as yet fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats or flows to and again in the Veins. Neither indeed can the blood poſſibly be derived which is already impacted in the part, or that already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be concocted, or to be turned into <hi>Pus,</hi> or quittery matter; ſince that it is now become more thick than formerly, and conſiſts (as having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up its abode) in that place out of which it cannot eaſily flow back, and thereupon is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the unfitter for motion, and the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and greedily retained by Nature until it be there digeſted and concocted. From whence wil eaſily appear, at what time the derivation ought to be ordained and adminiſtred, to wit, indeed in the very beginning of the Inflammation; and yet notwithſtanding not inſtanly upon the very
<pb n="2433" facs="tcp:49110:20"/> firſt onſet of the Diſeaſe, but toward the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation thereof, when its beginning is now at hand, to wit, when by means of Revulſion and Evacuation already both preſcribed and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the blood is rendered not over abundant, and that which is doth not as yet pertinaciouſly and fixedly adhere unto, or ſtick in the parts, but as yet continues to be fluxile and apt to flow. Wherefore, that we may rightly underſtand that which is on all hands taken from granted, to wit, that during the conſiſtency or continuance of the Inflammation derivation ought to be adminiſtred, this is not to be taken as meant either of the ſtate or (as we cal it) the perfection of the diſtemper, or of its declination, but rather of the latter part of its beginning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">In deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</note>Now in Derivation, that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and correſpondence that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Veins and the part affected (of which we have formerly made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is eſpecially to be obſerved. For if the blood that is in the Veins of the affected part ought to be drawn thence unto the neighbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parts by derivation, then in this caſe we muſt evermore make choyce of ſuch a Vein to effect it by as hath the neereſt commerce and vicinity with the part affected; the which if it be opened, brings along with it an apparent and admirable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. But now for the meaſure and proportion that we ought ſo heedfully to take notice of &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in letting blood by way of Derivation, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> informs us, in Book 7. of the Courſe of Diet in acute Diſeaſes, chap. 10. The blood (ſaith he) muſt be drawn away ſo far forth, and ſo long, until it flow forth more red, and much yellower, or that inſtead of a ruddy color it appear to be of a livid, or leaden-like color. For (as <hi>Galen</hi> there tels us) whatſoever blood is contained in a <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone,</hi> that ſame will be changed in its color through the abundance of heat, but the reſt will all of it continue alike in all parts of the body. And for this cauſe, that blood which is contained in that ſide that is afflicted and inflamed with a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> muſt needs be much more red and ruddy than that which is diſperſed and diffuſed throughout the whol body; eſpecially if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be pituitous or Phlegmy. Now if the blood that is diffuſed into the whol body appear to be al of it of a more ruddy color than ordinary, without doubt then that which accompanieth the <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone,</hi> boyled and burnt as it is, muſt needs be changed into a black hiew. And from hence it is, that a change in the color denotes and ſignifies a tranſlation of the blood from out of the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; which ſaid change notwithſtanding is not evermore to be expected, if ſtrength be wanting in the Patient.</p>
                     <p>And after ſuch like waies as theſe may the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that flowing forth together unto a part gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate there a Phlegmone be removed from the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved part. Among the which before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned notwithſtanding, thoſe Medicaments that drive back and derive very much, conduce (like as the other) for the removal of the humor that flows amain into the part affected. For Repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, although their principal ſcope be to repreſs the humor that flows in and is as yet contained within the Veins of the part; yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they have a power alſo to drive, and thruſt back again into the Veins, &amp; to caſt out of the part thoſe humors likewiſe that are newly fallen forth without thoſe Veins, and as yet not it removably fixed in the place whither they are fallen. For neither is it a thing impoſſible that the Humors that are fallen out of the Veins ſhould again retire back into them; even as many ſorts of Tumors in the skin evidence unto us the truth hereof, which now and then in a cold ſeaſon ſuddenly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away, and diſappear. And ſo likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation, albeit it hardly cal back thoſe Humors that are fallen forth without the Veins; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, as for the blood which fluctuates in the Veins of the inflamed part, it hath a power ſufficient to draw it unto the neighboring parts, and by them to evacuate it.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding,<note place="margin">Evacuation.</note> ſince that by the alone uſe of Repellers and Derivers al the whol matter is ſeldom evacuated out of the part inflamed, but that after the uſe of them for the moſt part ſomwhat is left remaining behind, this ought in another manner and by other means to be evacuated. Now this evacuation is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed after a twofold manner; either inſenſibly and by an imperciptible tranſpiration (which the Grecians cal <hi>adelos diapnoe</hi>) or elſe ſenſibly and manifeſtly: The matter is evacuated inſenſibly by Diaphoreticks or Sweaters, as likewiſe by thoſe that we term Digeſtive, Diſcuſſive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving Medicaments. The ſenſible evacuation is performed by ſcarification, and the opening of the part, after ſuppuration, or (as we commonly term it) maturation of the peccant humor. We will therefore in the firſt place treat of the former manner of evacuation, and declare our opinion touching diſcuſſive Remedies.</p>
                     <p>But now,<note place="margin">Diſcuſſion</note> ſince that reſolution or diſcuſſion is nothing elſe but an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the humor by an inſenſible tranſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it wil from hence eaſily be made to appear, that what is to be diſcuſſed ought to be thin or fluxile, and not over clammy and thick; neither the skin it ſelf too much ſhut up and condenſed. For if the matter be over thick, it cannot then be eaſily reſolved into vapors: but if the skin be too thick and compact; like as alſo if the matter ſtick in a place over deep; when all or any of theſe happen, then the matter cauſing the diſtemper finds not eaſily any way for its paſſage forth, neither can any Remedies but what are very forcible penetrate unto the place affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <pb n="2434" facs="tcp:49110:21"/>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Diſcuſſives, what they are for their quality</note>Moreover, ſince that al digeſtive Medicaments are hot in their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as by and by we ſhal further ſhew you) they are therefore to be adminiſtred not over haſtily in the very beginning of the Inflammation; but then we ought rather to make uſe of Repellers, for the reaſons before mentioned. But the Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on approaching now nigh unto (or if ye will, while it is yet in its paſſage towards) its augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſome kind of digeſting Medicaments ought to be mingled with the Repellers: and ſo al along the quantity of the Diſcuſſives ought evermore to be encreaſed, until at length in the declination they alone come to be adminiſtred. Now the truth is, al Digeſtives or Diaphoreticks are hot; for the Humor cannot be reſolved, attenuated, and converted into vapors, but only by heat. But of ſuch things as are hot there is a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: for ſome of them do only rarefie, or open the orifices of the Veſſels; other of them cut the Humors; and a third ſort there is that attracts and draws them; and laſt of all, there are others that are of a burning quality. Now the Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Medicaments differ from them all; and have in them this proper and peculiar faculty, to reſolve the Humors, and to convert them into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors. Which ſaid quality of theirs may not ſo eaſily be deſcribed by their Cauſes; but it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovered by the experience that we have of their effects: ſo that what cannot be defined by reaſon, that ſame is ſupplied by experience, and uſe. But now although al Diaphoretick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments are in their own Nature hot, and that they acquire this faculty from a certain due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion obſerved in their mixture; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, among them, ſome are ſtronger, ſome weaker. Thoſe of the milder ſort are, Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, Melilot, the Roots of Marſh-mallows, the Roots of white Lillies, and of Fenugreek, the flour or meal of Lupines, of Orobus or bitter Vetch, and of Cicers or Chiches; leavened Bread, Gooſe fat, old Oyl. The ſtronger of them are, Dill, Organy, Thyme, Pennyroyal, Hyſop, Calamint, Horehound, Orace roots, Rue, Sage, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ſeed, Fennel ſeed, Caraway ſeed, flowers of the Elder Tree, Ammoniack, Bdellium, Galbanum, Buls fat, Bears greaſe, Oyl of Rue and Laurel. And thoſe moſt of al forcible, are, Nitre, and the froth thereof, Sulphur or Brimſtone, Lime, and the like.</p>
                     <p>We make uſe of the milder ſort, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in a place not very deep; when the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and the body it ſelf is more ſoft and relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Inflammation but ſmal and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But if the Inflammation be greater, and the matter ſcituate more deep than ordinary, the body it ſelf more hard and condenſed, in this caſe the ſtronger Medicaments are to be adminiſtred. Notwithſtanding we ought to uſe the ſtronger Diſcuſſives with due caution, leſt that by them the thinner parts of the Humors being diſcuſſed and reſolved, and the thicker parts left remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, the Tumor ſhould be hardened, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady rendered incurable; which wil moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly be prevented, if together with ſuch things as forcibly diſcuſs we likewiſe mingle thoſe things that moiſten and mollifie. We ought in like manner to be very cautious, that the Diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives be not over tart and biting, leſt that by their biting property they the more excite pain, and augment the fluxion.</p>
                     <p>Now out of that before recited Medicamental matter, there are divers kinds and forms. In the end of the beginning of the Inflammation, and likewiſe in the augmentation, ſuch like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies as theſe that follow are of ſingular uſe.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This (moreover) as touching Digeſtives is to be taken notice of; to wit, That if the matter be groſſer and thicker than ordinary, inſomuch that Digeſtives cannot ſatisfie the expectation by doing their office, we muſt then do our endeavor that the matter may be rendered fit for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion and tranſpiration by ſweat; and this may conveniently and ſecurely be done by mollifying Remedies. And therefore in ſuch a caſe (as before we likewiſe hinted unto you) we ought not only to abſtain from thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that over-heat and dry; ſince that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs, waſt, and conſume the humidity that is in the Tumor, and harden the matter, and ſo cauſe the Malady to become altogether incurable: but we ought likewiſe to adminiſter mollifying and looſening Remedies, ſuch as do moderately heat, and withal do not exceſſively dry, but rather moiſten; which kind of Medicaments you may before find enumerated and reckoned up among the Digeſtives themſelves; ſuch as is Hens fat, Gooſe fat, the Roots of Marſh-mallows and white Lillies, Mallows, Lin-ſeed, Fenugreek, Bdellium, Ammoniacum, and ſuch like; al which are moſt fitly and conveniently adminiſtred when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is thicker than uſual, as we ſhal further ſhew you in its proper place, when we come to ſpeak of Emollients or Mollifiers. And in this manner the matter contained in an Inflammation is to be removed by inſenſible tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>But we have acquainted you that this matter is ſenſibly and perſpicuouſly poured forth either by ſcarification, or by opening of the part, after that the <hi>Pus</hi> or purulent matter is generated. As for what concerneth Scarification, that it ought to be adminiſtred, <hi>Galen</hi> gives us his judgment cleerly for it, whilſt that in his ninety fifth Chapter of the Method of Phyſick he thus writes: But thou ſhalt more eſpecially evacuate (ſaith he) both by the uſeful aſſiſtance of ſcarification, and by the help of Medicaments that have in them a power and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to diſſolve, in caſe thou obſerve any thing to be contained in the intervening middle ſpaces. And in his ſecond Chapter of a Tumor he thus writes: It is (ſaith he) by Phyſitians found to be expedient, in the caſe aforeſaid, not only to diſcuſs by the means of heaters, but likewiſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to evacuate at leaſt ſome part or portion of the blood it ſelf, by making ſcarifications in the Skin. But here then we are to know, that great heed and circumſpection ought to be taken and had, whether or no the matter may be turned into <hi>Pus,</hi> as we term it, being the ſnotty fetid matter enſuing upon maturation. For if we may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope for the ſaid ſuppuration, then the above mentioned ſcarifications have not any the leaſt place. But then on the other hand, if the matter may not be changed into the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> or matter, and that notwithſtanding likewiſe there be little or no hope that poſſibly it may be wholly diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or ſcattered by the application of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then in this caſe both Scarifications and Cupping-glaſſes may, nay ought to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. For theſe two are a very effectual and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Remedy for the evacuation of the matter (whatever it be) that ſticks and is deeply ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and which ſeemeth forthwith to be in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way of converſion into a <hi>Scirrhus.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are by no means to be adminiſtred in the beginning or firſt appearance of the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but at length after that the body is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently emptied, and that the <hi>Phlegmone</hi> is at a ſtay; that ſo there may be further cauſe to fear that a new fluxion ſhould be excited by that pain which originally proceeds from ſcarification; and then only when we have a purpoſe to extract that which remains over and above after the uſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient Remedies. Yet notwithſtanding Scarification hath place only in thoſe parts which in other caſes likewiſe are fit to undergo and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſaid Scarification. For if an Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on happen unto any part unto the which in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe ſcarification ought not to be adminiſtred, I conceive that there wil be found no man ſo raſh and unadviſed, as that he dare be ſo adventurous as after a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> (for the evacuation of the reſidue of the matter) to apply Cupping-glaſſes and adminiſter ſcarifications unto the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. But very rare it is that ſcarifications are admitted and allowed of for the uſe and purpoſe aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>But the ſafeſt and moſt uſual way of curing an Inflammation, is, that the matter which hath flown in unto the part be diſcuſſed by the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before propounded. But if thereby it may
<pb n="2436" facs="tcp:49110:22"/> not be effected,<note place="margin">Suppuration</note> we muſt then have recourſe unto ſome other means for the curing of the <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> and that is by Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration.</p>
                     <p>Now all this that hath been ſaid muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as ſpoken of a pure and ſimple <hi>Phlegmone.</hi> But if the Inflammation be not pure, but that it rather decline unto the nature of an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> or an <hi>Oedema,</hi> or a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> then thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are proper and convenient for theſe and ſuch like Tumors are to be intermingled with the other; yet evermore with this Proviſo, that ſuch of them as relate unto the <hi>Phlegmone</hi> be alwaies predominant.</p>

And when that that is ſuperfluous and corrupt in the part inflamed is ſeparated from what is uſeful, good, and ſerviceable, and that the vitious qualities are now hereby corrected and amended; and the very proper ſubſtance of the blood it ſelf ſhal be changed into an equal whitiſh and ſmooth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and gathered together into its proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar place, ſo that now without any difficulty at all it may upon the opening of the part be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated; then and not til then the <hi>Pus</hi> is ſaid to be now already perfectly concocted; and that ſame collection or gathering together of the ſnot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty filth, termed <hi>Pus</hi> or matter, into ſome one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place, is by the Grecians called <hi>Apoſtema,</hi> and by the Latines <hi>Abſceſſus;</hi> with us (in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh) it is named an Apoſtem or Impoſtume, as hath been ſaid before in the firſt Chapter. Now that concoction in mans Body is Natures work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the which by the help and aſſiſtance of the native heat digeſts the humors, takes pains with them, and as it were leads them along until it hath brought them unto that perfection which they ought to receive: which ſaid heat if it be ſtrong and vigorous, then we uſe to ſay, that the <hi>Pus</hi> or matter thereby bred is good and laudable; and it is (as we may find in the firſt Prognoſtick, Tom. 42.) white, equal, ſmooth, and not very ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nking and noyſom. But if the innate heat be weak, then it wil be quite and clean contrary unto what was in the former caſe. And therefore the Phyſitians office is, and his main care muſt be to cheriſh or preſerve, and encreaſe the native or natural heat in the inflamed parts, that ſo by means of it the generating and breeding of the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> may the better ſucceed, and the more eaſily attain unto its perfection. The innate heat is conſerved and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, if in the firſt place we take courſe to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the iſſuing forth of it, and then that in the next place we uſe all poſſible caution, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of it is more debile or weak in the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts may not be diſſipated by the ambient Air: and moreover, if Medicaments agreeable and ſuitable unto the Native heat be applied to the part affected; and hence it is that the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments preſcribed to facilitate the ſaid ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or production of <hi>Pus,</hi> ought to be ſuch as bear a reſemblance unto the native heat in the part to which they are applied. And thereupon ſince that our Nature is moiſt and hot, the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought in like manner to be anſwerable, to wit, hot and moiſt. Furthermore, let them be ſuch as we term <hi>Emplaſtick,</hi> that is, ſuch as have in them a certain clammineſs, that ſo they may fil up the Pores of the Skin, and that they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit and prevent the flowing forth of that heat that is ſo apt to evaporate. For all thoſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are of a cleanſing property, or elſe thoſe Medicaments that forcibly heat (ſuch as Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms of Bean meal, Fenugreek, Chiches, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, &amp;c.) ſeeing that they permit the vapors to exhale and vent themſelves outwardly, they may indeed in this reſpect be ſaid to dry, but they little or nothing at all further Suppuration.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Signs of <hi>Pus</hi> or ripe matter.</note>When the <hi>Pus,</hi> that is, the puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter, hath once arrived at its perfection, we muſt then do our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor that with all ſpeed poſſible it may be evacuated. But then firſt of all it muſt manifeſtly appear unto us, whether or no the <hi>Pus</hi> be already made and brought to perfection. For although in general we have already before (in Chap. 3. concerning Impoſtumes) ſpoken of this ſame ſubject; yet notwithſtanding thoſe things which are moſt proper to an Inflammation ſeem needfull here again to be repeated. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt and ſureſt ſign is taken from the Touch. And firſt, if the part he perceived to be ſoft whiles that it is preſſed, and that there is therein felt (as it were) a certain kind of flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuation; to wit, if two fingers of both hands, or the fore-finger and middle finger of one hand be applied to the Tumor, but yet ſo that they touch not one the other, but be ſome little diſtance aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, and that one of the fingers preſs down the Tumor, &amp; the other not: for then a certain fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and motion of the matter which is driven forth from place to place is perceived under the other finger that lies quiet. But here notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it will not be amiſs to take this caution, leſt that we be miſtaken, and either (the matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being compleated) deem that there is no <hi>Pus</hi> or matter lying underneath, or elſe, that we open the part, albeit there (indeed) be no filth, which we uſually call <hi>Pus</hi> or matter. For why, there appears a Fluctuation in ſome certain parts, even whiles they are ſound; ſuch as are the places about the Knees. And on the contrary, now and then the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> or filthy ſnot-like matter, although (as to its maturation or ripening) it be complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet it doth not evermore of it ſelf evidence the ſigns and tokens thereof. Touching which <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> likewiſe makes mention in his ſixth Book, Aphor. 41. where he thus writes: Unto whom purulent matter exiſting and abiding in the Body doth notwithſtanding diſappear, and not diſcover it ſelf by any kind of token or ſignification, there we are to underſtand that it doth not diſcloſe it ſelf ei her by reaſon of its own thickneſs, or the condenſedneſs of the place. To wit, the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> ever and anon lieth hid and conceal'd and doth not diſcover it ſelf, either by the reaſon of the denſity, that is, the thickneſs, and withal the hardneſs of the place affected; or elſe becauſe of the profundity, or if you wil, the depth of the place where it reſides; as for inſtance, when an Impoſtume hath its reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and lies hid between the Muſcles of the Belly, or of the Thigh, or of the great Joynts: like as it comes to paſs alſo in the Heel, and the ſole of the Foot, by means of the Skins extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thickneſs. Or elſe it happeneth, in regard that the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> it ſelf is overgoſs and thick; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account it neither can be driven forth unto the ſuperficies, neither doth it yeild unto the compreſſion of the fingers, and ſo conſequently fluctuate.</p>
                     <p>There are moreover other ſigns of <hi>Pus</hi> (when perfectly bred) diſappearing and lying hid. To wit, ſecondly, the place (in reference to its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor) declineth unto a certain kind of whiteiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when the maturation is already terminated; whereas before and until ſuch time as the filthy corrupt matter was ripened, it was of a more rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or reddiſh color. Thirdly, it is a ſign, and it argueth that the <hi>Pus</hi> or the quittor is compleatly ripened, if that both the heat and pain be remitted, and the extenſion and pulſation of the part be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; touching which likewiſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thus writes, in his ſixth Book, Aphor. 47. The pains and Feavers happen and are alwaies more intenſe whileſt that <hi>Pus</hi> is in breeding, and untill it be perfectly bred, then after ſuch time as it is fully ripened, and the maturation compleated. For the concoction being once made &amp; paſt, there is ſome certain portion of the matter and of the vapors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; and the matter being converted into <hi>Pus</hi> is gathered together into one place: from whence it likewiſe proceeds, that the ſenſe and feeling of pain is not now any longer ſo great and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as before, and alſo all the other ſymptoms ſlacken and grow remiſs. The fourth ſign is, that the Tumor ſtruts forth (as it were) into an eminent heighth and ſharp-pointedneſs. For Nature thruſteth forth the elaborated and ripened <hi>Pus,</hi> and confines it unto ſome one place, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her power expels it unto the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts, and that place more eſpecially by the which it may with leaſt difficulty and danger be emptied and caſt forth.</p>
                     <p>If therefore by theſe ſigns we get aſſurance that the <hi>Pus</hi> (as we term it) is already made, we muſt then (as hath been ſaid) do our utmoſt endeavor, that without the leaſt delay it may be evacuated. For if the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> be overlong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined it overthrows the temper of the member, corrupts the adjoyning &amp; neer neighboring parts and ſo the Ulcer proves to be intrictae and full of
<pb n="2438" facs="tcp:49110:23"/> turnings, or elſe degenerates into a Fiſtula; which is then wont more eſpecially to happen, when the matter is ſharp and malignant; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when the Inflammation is ſeated in the joynts, in the Arſe-hole (as we cal it) and ſuch like parts.</p>
                     <p>Now as for the manner of Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">The evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of <hi>Pus</hi> or corrupt matter out of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume.</note> it is (as hath likewiſe been ſhewn before, in the third Chapter, touching an Impoſtume in general) twofold; either by the opening of the part, or elſe by inſenſible tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. And very commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if not for the moſt part, that kind of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume which we cal <hi>Vomica</hi> (which is an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume ful of ſnot-like filth or matter) is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with opened; and that alſo very conveniently, and uſually with good ſucceſs. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Galen</hi> in his third Book of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 15. doth not inſtantly proceed to opening, but firſt of al aſſayes what may be done by exhalation and inſenſible diſcuſſion. And this is eſpecially practiſed in that affect which we term the Kings Evil, and generally in al Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the Neck, Arm-holes, and al the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous kernelly parts. For if ſuch like parts ſhould be opened and altered by the ambient Air, it is poſſible (and indeed very frequently ſeen) that from thence the Ulcers are rendered either alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incurable, or at leaſt more difficultly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and of longer duration. But here we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be over cautious. For whenas this ſaid reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and diſcuſſion of the purulent corrupt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happeneth but ſeldom, and never but after a longer tract of time, ſo that thereupon there is great cauſe to fear, leſt that it ſhould in the mean while corrupt the neer neighboring parts, and cauſe windings to and fro in the part affected; then in this caſe, al the circumſtances ought heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be weighed, and duly conſidered. For if that the <hi>Pus</hi> be good and laudable, thin, not much of it, not ſcituate in a deep place, but rather ſeated in the ſuperficies; and if the Skin be ſofter and thinner, then perhaps we may have ſome ground to hope and expect a diſcuſſion. But if the caſe ſtand quite contrary, and it be ſo that the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> be not good and commendable, but that it be thick, fixed in a deeper place than ordinary, and likewiſe if the Skin be thicker than is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; then to attempt reſolution, and to defer ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wil be a courſe altogether ſafe, and void of danger. But where there is any hope given of reſolution, we muſt then make uſe of the ſtronger ſort of Digeſtives to accompliſh this diſcuſſion. Of this kind is that Medicament which <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> (in his fourth Book, Chap. 18.) hath preſcribed; which drives forth thoſe Impoſtumes that are already throughly concocted, and quite and clean diſcuſſeth and ſcattereth ſuch as are not concocted.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the ſtone</hi> Pyrita, <hi>Ammoniack, of each one ounce and half: of Bean Meal ſix drams: let them be incorporated with liquid Rozin, and let the liquid Medicament be ſpread upon a Skin, and not taken away until it fall off of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This likewiſe is ſingularly uſeful;</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Ammoniack two ounces: Galbanum half an ounce: Lithargyrie three ounces: old Oyl as much as wil ſuffice: make a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if (which but ſeldom happens) the <hi>Pus</hi> cannot inſenſibly be diſcuſſed,<note place="margin">The opening of an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume.</note> then it is ſenſibly to be emptied forth and evacuated by opening the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume. Now either the Impoſtume is broken of it ſelf, or elſe it is opened by art. The Impoſtume is opened of it ſelf, whilſt that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and wait until the <hi>Pus</hi> corrode and fret away the skin it ſelf; which we are allowed to do, in caſe the Tumor or Swelling be not ſo very great; but eſpecially if it be in the outwardmoſt part of the Skin and fleſh, and under the Skin that is not over thick. But it is not evermore ſafe to expect a Spontaneous and voluntary opening. For (as <hi>Galen</hi> writes upon this very ſubject, in his ſecond Book to <hi>Glauco,</hi> and ſixth Chapter) when Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which arrive at Impoſtumes ſhal be long neglected ere they be launced and cut (either by reaſon of the unskilfulneſs of thoſe that undertake the Cure, or the fearfulneſs of the Patient that is under cure, who wil not ſuffer themſelves to be cut,<note place="margin">when it is to be put in practice.</note> but wil rather wait and expect until that in proceſs of time the Skin be corroded and eaten through) it then very often comes to paſs that the whol Skin is exceedingly extenuated by reaſon of the purulent matter heaped up together neer unto the Impoſtume, not unlike unto that which the Greeks cal <hi>Racos,</hi> that is, a rent Garment; from whence it is that Phyſitians have impoſed upon it this appellation or name, <hi>Racodes,</hi> that is to ſay, rent and torn. And if this chance, the Skin in this manner and by this means extenuated wil very hardly ever after be brought to cement and unite with the part that is ſubjected and lieth underneath it. But now, in the firſt place, the ſaid opening is not to be delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a voluntary eruption of the corrupt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be expected, if ſo be that the fleſh and skin be thicker than ordinarily; and if there be in that part Nerves, Veins, and Tendons. For then the Impoſtume is to be opened as ſoon as poſſibly it may be, leſt that if the opening be deferred, the malignancy of the purulent matter corrupt and eat aſunder the Nerves and Tendons; eſpecially if the Impoſtume be ever a whit nigh unto the Joynts. Yea, in ſome certain places, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, neer about the Arſe, and the Sutures, we are ſcarcely allowed to expect the higheſt and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perfection of the ſaid <hi>Pus,</hi> leſt that the more profound and deep parts putrefie, and thence a long laſting, or Fiſtula-like Ulcer be generated.
<pb n="2439" facs="tcp:49110:23"/> And therefore if the corroſion or gnawing aſunder of the Skin, and conſequently that ſpontaneous eruption of the filth and corruption he not to be expected, the Impoſtume is then forthwith to be opened; and this ought to be performed in that place of it that is the higheſt and moſt eminent; for there the Skin is at the thinneſt: and withal it is likewiſe to be opened at the ſame time, in ſome more ſloping and inferior place thereof, that ſo the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> may the more eaſily paſs forth. It is to be opened either with an Iron Inſtrument, or elſe by Medicaments. The Iron that openeth it muſt either be ſuch as is heated in the fire, or elſe ſuch an Inſtrument as is prepared to cut. We moſt rarely make uſe of the Iron heated in the fire, and never unleſs in caſe of urgent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neceſſity; as for inſtance, if it ſhould ſo chance, that there be a Tumor in thoſe parts that are ful of Veins and Arteries, and ſuch other like caſes. For there the dangerous flowing forth of the Blood is checked and ſuppreſſed by the fire-heated Iron. But moſt frequently it is opened with an Inſtrument that is fitted expeditely to cut; and this knife ought to be ſharpened to the utmoſt, that ſo the Section may be performed without putting the Patient unto any extream and intollerable pain; and (if poſſibly it may be done) ſo that the ſick party may take no notice thereof. But in the accompliſhing of this work we muſt evermore look wel unto it, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (or cuttings) be no larger than needs muſt; and yet (on the other hand) not ſo ſmal, but that they relieve the preſent neceſſity; I mean, that by the Orifice of the inciſion the <hi>Pus</hi> may find an open and free paſſage forth. For if the Wound be leſs than that the corruption may rightly paſs out thereat, then it wil be requiſite that the part be preſſed down; by which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion pain is evermore excited, and the Ulcer is rendered callous and brawny; from whence a Fiſtula may poſſibly ariſe. But on the other ſide, if the Inciſion be wider than it needed to have been; then both the Cicatrix or Scar will be greater (and more unſightly) than if it had been artificially made; and then likewiſe the parts ſubjected wil be altered by the ambient air; and now &amp; then the part is thereby made the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. <hi>Celſus</hi> (in his ſeventh Book, and ſecond Chapter) gives in charge, that the Inciſion be made after the reſemblance of the Myrtle Leaf, that is, that a ſimple downright Section be made, and that it be ſo long, that when the lips thereof are dilated the Wound may bear a reſemblance to the Myrtle Leaf. And ſomtimes one only Section doth not ſuffice; but (as <hi>Celſus</hi> there inſtructs us) greater turnings and nooks are by inciſion to be made in two or more lines. And this alſo is carefully to be obſerved, That the Section be made according to the fibres, that is, anſwerable to the ſmal ſtrings or hairs of the Muſcles. Now the Fibres proceed ſtraight forth, and for the moſt part according to the length of the body, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in ſome certain places, as in the forehead. Now this is therefore to be heeded, that ſo we may not hurt or hinder the motion and action of the member; which yet we need not to obſerve, if the Tumor be in the Superficies, and cloſe under the Skin; but then only, when the <hi>Pus</hi> ſticks in the very ſubſtance of the Muſcle. In the firſt place therefore we muſt take due heed that we keep at a good diſtance from the Nerves, as alſo the Veins and Arteries, and that we come not nigh them. The Inſtruments we make uſe of for the opening of Impoſtumes are very many. The firſt is the Razor; then next the Myrtle Knife, which they commonly cal the Lancet; thirdly, a Knife or Inſtrument reſembling the Olive Tree; fourthly, our Country-men likewiſe open Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes with the Pen-knife, or that with which they let blood when they open a Vein. But of neceſſity theſe Inſtruments muſt variouſly be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, according to the great variety and difference of circumſtances. For if the Impoſtume be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated, and the Skin be thicker than uſually, then it wil be needful proportionably to make the Section ſo much the more profound and deep. But if it be (as we uſe to ſay) <hi>ſubcutaneous,</hi> that is, lying cloſe under the Skin, there will then be no neceſſity for this ſo deep an Inciſion.</p>
                     <p>But in regard there are many that wil not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Section or Inciſion, we therefore preſcribe and adminiſter unto ſuch perſons Medicaments whereby the impoſtume may be opened. But thoſe Medicaments are hot al of them of one and the ſame ſort, neither of a like efficacy; for ſome of them are weaker, and other ſtronger. The ſtronger ſort of them are not over raſhly to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred. For they both prolong the Diſeaſe, and introduce an evil diſtemper into the part; and poſſibly they may likewiſe produce divers other ill ſymptoms. And therefore the gentler ſort of them are firſt of al to be adminiſtred, which do rather ripen the matter and draw it to the higheſt part of the Tumor, and withal do there render the Skin more ſubtile, and cauſe it to become more tender, than truly and properly corrode, eat aſunder, and break the Skin. And ſuch are theſe that follow:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Marſh-mallow roots, and white Lillies, of each alike one once: Garlick, Onions roſted under embers, the flour of Fenugreek ſeed, dried Figs fat and ful, of each two drams: the dough of Bread well leavened one dram and an half: Oyl of white Lillies, Butter, Swines fat, of each alike as much as wil ſuffice, and make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Onions, Garlick, Marſh-mallow roots, equal parts of them al: boyl them to a ſoftneſs, and when they be wel bruiſed add the flour of Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek as much as any one part of them: the fat of an old Hog as much as will ſuffice, and mingle
<pb n="2440" facs="tcp:49110:24"/> them wel.</hi> This following is more forcible.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of ſharp and ſowr Leaven half an ounce, Onions roſted under live coals one ounce, Doves Dung one dram; black Soap, Swines Fat, of each alike as much as is ſufficient; and mingle them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emplaſter <hi>Diachylon</hi> mingled with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Seed, Figs, and Salt, performs the ſame with the former.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch like Medicaments are more eſpecially applied unto that part in the which the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume is ſharp-pointed; and round about it there is put to ſomwhat that is maturative or ripening (underſtand it here of ſimple maturatives) as <hi>Diachylon,</hi> which to this end is wont to have a hole made through the mid'ſt. The ſtrongeſt ſort of them are thoſe that we call potential Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; the which kind of Remedies we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in our Inſtitutions; among which that is the moſt efficacious, and withall the moſt ſafe, which is prepared and made out of Lee, out of which there is a certain ſope prepared; touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we have likewiſe ſpoken in our Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now of ſuch a Cautery we are to take a certain ſmal proportion, to the quantity of half a Cicer or Peaſe, and then apply it unto the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner. Take the Cloth that is ſpread over with the Emplaſter, and cauſe it to ſtick cloſe to the Skin; then in the mid'ſt thereof cut a ſmal hole, ſomwhat narrower and ſtreighter than you intend the Cautery ſhall be. After this take the Cautery, and being ſomwhat moiſtened with Spittle apply it unto the Skin that appears and lies open to view through the aforeſaid hole, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward lay on another Emplaſter upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. After two or three hours remove the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with the Plaiſter; upon the removal of which the part appears black, ſoft, and without any ſenſe or feeling. And that this burnt part may be wholly taken away, let it be all over throughly beſmeared with unſalted or freſh But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or with the fat of an Hog, or with ſome other fit Digeſtive. But if the hole be not wide and large enough, it may very eaſily be dilated, to wit, if either a little piece of Spunge or Gentian root, or Rape root dry be put thereinto. For theſe things aforeſaid when they are filled full with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity they are then dilated, and ſo conſequently widen and enlarge the hole. The Spunge is thus to be prepared: the Spunge is to be wel ſoaked in the white of an Egg twice or thrice throughly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together; then afterwards let it be cloſe ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed together on all ſides, and then let it be leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dried in the ſhade: a ſmal portion of this (when it is dried) is to be taken and put upon the Ulcer. But in regard that the cruſtineſs thereof wil not fall off in a few daies time, and that all this while the <hi>Pus</hi> or filthy corruption (unleſs it ſtick immediately under the Skin) is detained and impriſoned in the Impoſtume, for this very cauſe, if there were no other, it is by far the ſafer way to open the Impoſtume with an Iron.</p>
                     <p>The Impoſtume being now opened (whatever the way of opening it hath been) the <hi>Pus</hi> or matter is to be evacuated, but yet this needs not evermore to be wholly all at once or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For if the Impoſtume be great, and contain much <hi>Pus</hi> within it, neer unto the Arteries and Veins, the whole matter and filth ought by no means to be evacuated all at once, leſt that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therewith much of the Spirits be likewiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated and diſſipated, and ſo by this means the ſick Perſon ſhould be cauſed to faint and ſwoon, or be debilitated and weakned: but rather the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is to be emptied forth by ſome and ſome, eſpecially if the Patient be weak, or a Woman with Child; or in caſe the Patient be a Child, or laſtly, if the ſick party be very aged. When the <hi>Pus</hi> is evacuated, if either pain manifeſt it ſelf, or elſe any reliques of the matter not ſuppurated appear in the circumference, and it be ſo that the <hi>Pus</hi> it ſelf be not wel and perfectly ripened; then the pain is to be mitigated, and more eſpecially the remainder of the matter is ſpeedily to be converted into the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> by ſome concocting Medicament, which they commonly call a Digeſtive. And ſuch is that which is made of the Oyl of Roſes, and the Yelks of Eggs: for it greatly mitigates the pain, and helps forward the generating and breeding of the <hi>Pus</hi> ſo often mentioned. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Turpentine one ounce, one Yelk of an Egg, the Pouder or Duſt of Frankincenſe one dram, Oyl of Roſes three drams; mingle them wel together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Likewiſe the Emplaſter <hi>Diachylon ſimplex</hi> is very profitable in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>When this is once accompliſhed, even while the concoction doth yet appear, we muſt come to thoſe things that throughly cleanſe and purge it: for neither can there fleſh be bred, nor any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination (by drawing together the Lips of the Impoſtumated part) be made, unleſs the part be firſt cleanſed. Which to effect,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Clear Turpentine one ounce, Honey of Roſes ſix drams, the Yelk of one Egg; let them boyl together a little, and afterward add of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron one ſcruple, and a little quantity of Barley meal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If there be need of a greater cleanſing, you may then add the juyce of Smallage. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of crude Honey, Barley meal, of each a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, one ounce; of the Juyce of Smallage half an ounce, Saffron half a ſcruple; and mingle them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If yet there be occaſion for a more forcible cleanſer, there may be added of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngueut E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptiack</hi> as much as wil ſuffice.</p>
                     <p>Centaury the leſs, and round Birthwort is here likewiſe very uſeful. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the juyce of the leſſer Centaury two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Smallage one ounce, Honey three ounces; let them boyl together, and after add of Barley meal,
<pb n="2441" facs="tcp:49110:24"/> and the Vetch</hi> Orobus, <hi>of each ſix drams: when they are taken from the fire, add of Turpentine one ounce, of the Pouder of the Flower-de-luce root one dram; mingle them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Impoſtume being throughly cleanſed, ſuch Medicaments as breed &amp; cauſe fleſh are to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred. Now of what ſort theſe are, <hi>Galen</hi> in his third Book of the Method of Phyſick, the ſecond, third, and fourth Chapters teacheth us at larhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we have likewiſe declared them in our Book of Inſtitutions. As for example,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Frankincenſe, Maſtick, of each half an ounce, Colophony two ounces, Oyl of Roſes and Honey, of each as much as is ſufficient; let them be mingled.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>The greater Comfrey one handful, Beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Saint Johns-wort, Horſ-tail Graſs, of each half a handful; boyl them in Wine, and bruiſe them wel: out of the maſh of them ſqueez forth a Juyce, and add of Frankincenſe and Maſtick of each one ounce &amp; half; Dragons blood an ounce, Honey and Turpentine, of each a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; boyl them until the juyce be conſumed, and make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Myrrh, Aloes, Sarcocol, of each an ounce; Honey ſix drams, White Wine as much as wil ſuffice; boyl them to an indifferent thickneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Ulcer is filled up with Fleſh, then thoſe Medicaments which we cal <hi>Epuloticks,</hi> that is, ſuch as bring to a Scar, are to be adminiſtred; of which we have in like manner ſpoken in our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; ſuch as are, the Emplaſter <hi>Diapalma</hi> or <hi>Diachalciteos, de minio</hi> of <hi>Vigo,</hi> and others, which are every where known.</p>

                  <p>BUt it oftentimes ſo happeneth, that although the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> or ſnotty filth be emptied forth of the Impoſtume, yet notwithſtanding it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes again repleniſhed; from whence it comes to paſs that the adjacent Skin doth not cloſe, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten and grow together with the Fleſh that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath it; but there is a certain cavity or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs left to remain; and at length there ariſeth a certain difficulty, if not impoſſibility, of cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and conjoyning the skin with the Bodies lying underneath; which affect the Greeks cal <hi>Colpos,</hi> and the Latines term it <hi>Sinus;</hi> to wit, when the enterance into the Impoſtume and Ulcer appears narrow enough: but the deeper and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found part thereof diffuſeth it ſelf into a breadth.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>Now for the moſt part, the Cauſes of this <hi>Sinus</hi> are Impoſtumes or Suppurated Tumors, over-ſlowly opened, or not wel cleanſed. For the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption if it be longer deteined in the deep place than it ought to be acquireth a certain kind of ſharp corroding quality, and there cauſeth divers winding paſſages and turnings, ſuch like as we find in Coney-borrows; and ſo unto the part in this manner affected there flow together from the neighboring parts, yea from all the whole body, ſuch excrements and ſuch humors as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound; from whence afterwards it chanceth, that this kind of <hi>Sinus</hi> or windings to and fro can very hardly be conglutinated and filled up with Fleſh.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="differences">
                     <head>The Differences.</head>
                     <p>But now of theſe <hi>Sinus</hi> there is an exceeding great diverſity: for they differ not only in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion of quantity (that one ſhould be leſs and ſhorter, and another more deep or broad) or in their figure (that one ſhould be ſtraight, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full of turnings, of this or that figure) but moſt eſpecially they differ in the manner of their ſcituation and poſition; becauſe that kind of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference doth not a little vary the Cure. For that which tends upwards affords us a better hope and ſurer expectation of cure, ſeeing that by its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the <hi>Pus</hi> may the more readily flow forth and be evacuated. But that which tendeth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards doth longer retein the ſaid <hi>Pus;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept in doth further corrupt and corrode the parts. Wherefore ſuch a <hi>Sinus</hi> is not to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unleſs you open it on the adverſe or oppoſite part, that ſo the <hi>Pus</hi> may freely come forth out of it. Now that the Phyſitian may not be ignorant of theſe Differences, but that he may know and well underſtand whither the <hi>Sinus</hi> reacheth, and how great it is, an exact and ſtrict ſearch muſt be made thereinto by Tents, or otherwiſe with thoſe Silver Inſtruments (we cal them Probes) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chirurgeons are wont to ſearch unto the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of deep Wounds; as likewiſe by Wax Candles (or the like) gently conveyed down into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deepeſt part of the <hi>Sinus.</hi> And withall we muſt do our utmoſt endeavor, that the <hi>Sinus</hi> may be ſpeedily cured; for unleſs it be ſpedily cured it contracts to it ſelf a certain callous or brawny ſuperficies; and in proceſs of time it becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hard; neither will it afterward be cured without much difficulty and danger.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, what hopes there may be, the qualities of the part it ſelf that is affected do evidently demonſtrate, and chiefly the matter which flows forth out of the <hi>Sinus.</hi> For if it be much, not digeſted; if there be pain ſenſibly felt in the <hi>Sinus,</hi> or if a Tumor or Swelling appear, as yet there is but ſmall hopes of its Cure: but then if the <hi>Pus</hi> be but little in quantity, if it be good, white; if there be preſent no pain, and all the whole place be equal; it is a great and ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the <hi>Sinus</hi> is already filled with Fleſh.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>As for what concerns the Cure; ſince that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs &amp; ſolution of Unity are the Cauſes of the
<pb n="2442" facs="tcp:49110:25"/> 
                        <hi>Sinus,</hi> the ſolution of Unity points us out to the procurement of an uniting; but the Cavity inſtructs us, that repletion ought to be endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But now thoſe things that ſtand at a diſtance cannot be united, unleſs firſt that which is hollow be filled up; whereupon the Cavity muſt in the firſt place be repleniſhed. But the Cavity can by no means be filled with fleſh, unleſs the temper of the part be right as it ought; and that the ſaid <hi>Sinus</hi> be free and clean from al its impurities. And therefore we muſt primarily provide by a ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous endeavor, that if there be any diſtemper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it may be removed, and that the <hi>Sinus</hi> may be wel and throughly purged. And moreover, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that either the Orifice of the ſaid <hi>Sinus</hi> look downward, or that the Member may be ſo placed that the matter may freely flow out of it, before any thing elſe be done a way muſt be opened, and a paſſage forth made for the <hi>Pus</hi> or filthy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the Orifice of the Impoſtume lie open toward the inferior parts, the filth hath then a free paſſage forth, and ſuch a like <hi>Sinus</hi> by the application of Cleanſers is eaſily cured. But then if the Orifice be in the ſuperior place, there is a neceſſity that we forthwith aſſay to open a free vent and paſſage forth for the corruption.</p>
                     <p>And this may be done in a twofold manner; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by diſſecting the whol Cavity, or at leaſt by opening the Orifice in the inferior part. Now of a truth it is the more convenient of the two that we open al the whol <hi>Sinus;</hi> ſince that by ſo doing the Ulcer may the more eaſily be purged and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But becauſe we are not evermore allowed to put this in practice, to wit, when the <hi>Sinus</hi> is great, and that the whol part may not be diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted without danger; therefore ſometimes we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>n the <hi>Sinus</hi> in the bottom thereof. Which being done, and the <hi>Sinus</hi> opened, it is carefully and throughly to be cleanſed and dried, leſt that there be any of the <hi>Pus</hi> left remaining. For if there be any of it left behind, from thence Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's and recidivations o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Relapſes are wont to take their Original. And although the parts may ſeem to be conglutinated, yet notwithſtanding they do not rightly cohere or ſtick together, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they do again part aſunder. But now, to the furthering of the evacuation of the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> the uſe of Swathbands &amp; Pillows doth very much conduce, if with them we ſtreightly compreſs and ſtrictly keep down the part affected from the higher part of the <hi>Sinus</hi> towards its Orifice. Now the Medicaments fitted for this uſe and purpoſe are, the Water of the Decoction of Barley, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licrate</hi> (that is, Water and Honey ſodden toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) which is of it ſelf ſufficiently purgative, ſo that alone it is able to render that <hi>Sinus</hi> whoſe orifice is in the inferior place apt and fit for gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or cementing together; <hi>Mulſum,</hi> that is, Wine and Honey ſodden together, which both corroborate, and together withal purgeth; Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin, Turpentine, Honey of Roſes, Barley meal, Bean meal, the flour of <hi>Orobus</hi> or bitter Vetch, of Lupines, Lee, Spirit of Wine, Bath-Water, Allum Water, Oxymel, Unguent Aegyptiack; which are the ſtronger ſort of them, and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred only (or at leaſt chiefly) in the moſt impure and naſty Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>Out of thoſe before mentioned divers others may be made and compounded: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Honey of Roſes ſtrained ſix drams: Barley meal a ſufficient quantity, to give it a thick Body.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Honey of Roſes ſtrained ſix drams: cleer Turpentine one ounce: the juyce of Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and Wormwood, of each half an ounce: let them boyl together: and afterward add of Bean, Barley, and Lupine Meal, of each alike, as much at will ſuffice, and then mingle them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But when (as now and then it happens) the <hi>Sinus</hi> are manifold, or otherwiſe when they are of an extraordinary depth, ſo that to open them is altogether impoſſible; neither alſo can the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents poſſibly penetrate throughout their whol Cavity; then (in this caſe eſpecially) liquid ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſives are chiefly approved of, as ſuch which can inſinuate and convey themſelves into al parts of the <hi>Sinus.</hi> And ſuch kind of Medicaments ought to be injected by a Tunnel, or by a pipe; and ſo ſoon as the Medicament is caſt in, the Orifice ought ſomtimes to be ſtopt up with a Linnen cloth or Napkin; or elſe with a piece of Silk, to prevent the immediate flowing back again of the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of whol Barley three pugils or ſmal band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls: Centaury the leſſer, and Wormwood, of each alike two pugils: boyl them in Melicrate, and make an injection.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Water of decocted Barley, Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, of each two ounces: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent Aegyptiack half an ounce; mingle and inject them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thereupon, if by theſe kind of Medicaments the Ulcer be ſufficiently cleanſed and purged, then thoſe Medicaments that produce and breed fleſh are to be adminiſtred. For albeit Nature her ſelf generate and breed fleſh; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Art doth by Medicaments ſo far forth aſſiſt Nature, as it removeth and carrieth away the excrements which much hinder her in her operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it is generally wel known that any part whatſoever (although it be ſound) doth generate a twofold excrement, and drive it forth without the body; one whereof is more thin, which for the moſt part breathes forth by inſenſible tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and is alſo not unuſually evacuated by ſweat; the other more groſs and thick, which outwardly adheres unto the body, and by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral name is termed Scurf, filth, or naſtineſs. Theſe excrements whenas they are reſident in the aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved part, being weak and infirm, and cannot by the ſtrength of Nature be expelled and driven
<pb n="2443" facs="tcp:49110:25"/> forth of the Ulcer, they ſtil perſiſt to ſtick there in the Ulcer, and the thick excrement renders the Ulcer filthy and foul; but the thin excrement makes the Ulcer to become moiſt. Which ſaid excrements ſince that they are an impediment to Nature in the breeding of fleſh, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore altogether to be removed and taken away; and to ſpeak more perſpicuouſly and plainly, the filth and impurities thereof are to be throughly cleanſed and wiped away from off the Ulcer, and the moiſture is to be dried up.</p>
                     <p>Now thoſe Medicaments which accompliſh the aboveſaid intentions are called <hi>Sarcoticks,</hi> i. e. Breeders of fleſh; not that they themſelves can indeed really generate fleſh (which is the peculiar work of Nature alone) but becauſe (as we have ſaid) they take away the impediments, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Nature with ſo good a blood, that from it good fleſh may eaſily and ſoon be ingendred. Now ſuch like as theſe are dry, yet are they not of an over dry quality, but of ſuch a faculty as very little (and that likewiſe moderately) exceeds the temperament of the affected or grieved part. But ſince that there is not the ſame kind or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of drineſs in al Bodies and Members, thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame matter is not uſeful for the engende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and breeding of fleſh in al bodies and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but thoſe bodies and members which are drier require and need the dryer Medicaments; but thoſe that are more humid and moiſt cal for Medicaments that are leſs drying. The more mild and gentle of them are, Frankincenſe, Barley meal, Bean meal; the ſtronger are, the meal or flour of <hi>Orobus</hi> or bitter Vetch, Flower-de-luce root, Root of <hi>Ariſtolochia,</hi> Myrrh, Tutia, Pompho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyx, and the like. From which we may very fitly and commodiouſly prepare Compoſitions for the preſent occaſion. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Turpentine two ounces: Frankincenſe, Maſtick, Colophony, of each half an ounce: Wax, Oyl of Roſes, of each ſufficient; make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this following is ſomwhat ſtronger and more forcible. Viz.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Round Ariſtolochia, Flowerdeluce, the greater Comfrey, of each two drams: Maſtick, Frankincenſe, Myrrh, Aloes, of each one dram: Honey and Turpentine, of each ſufficient, and throughly mingle them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the body be more than ordinary dry, and if that hard fleſh be to be generated, and that the Ulcer it ſelf lie open, we may alſo then adminiſter Medicaments in a dry form, and make up Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Pouders, to ſtrew thereupon. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Frankincenſe, Maſtick, Colophony, of each alike: make a Pouder.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Aloes, Frankincenſe, Sarcocol, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons blood, of each as much as ye will, and make a Pouder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Sinus</hi> be not open, then liquid Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks are by a Funnel to be injected after the ſame manner as the cleanſers were; and the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice being cloſe ſhut up, they are for a while to be left in the <hi>Sinus.</hi> For which end and purpoſe there may be injected auſtere or ſharp Wine in which Frankincenſe hath been boyled; or the Decoction of Ariſtolochia, the great Comfty which ſome cal Wall-wort, Horſetail, Roſes, and the like, with Wine; unto which may be added, Frankincenſe, Myrrh, Aloes.</p>
                     <p>But now whether or no by means of theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments the deeper parts of the <hi>Sinus</hi> are wel cemented and exactly conjoyned, that which floweth forth wil evidently demonſtrate: which if it be but little in quantity, and wel digeſted; and moreover if there be no pain perceived in the <hi>Sinus</hi> it ſelf, it is an argument that there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conglutination effected. But if the fourth, or (at the utmoſt) the ſeventh day ſhal be paſt, and yet notwithſtanding a crude raw humor ſhal iſſue forth of the Ulcer, it is a ſign that as yet the <hi>Sinus</hi> is not exactly united and conjoyned, and that fleſh is not as yet therein bred; whereupon thoſe Medicaments that more forcibly dry (yet notwithſtanding without any kind of mordicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or biting) are then to be adminiſtred. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now the <hi>Sinus</hi> is in a manner filled up, ſome one or other of the agglutinating Remedies ought to be applied, which may gently and without any the leaſt acrimony cloſe together the tender fleſh that is generated and bred (of which ſort are thoſe which by the Greeks are called <hi>Enaima;</hi>) that ſo they may as it were conjoyn the divided parts, and may likewiſe cure the new made Wounds: of which ſort <hi>Galen</hi> (in his ſecond Book of the compoſition of Medicaments accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeveral kinds, Chap. 21. and 32.) hath given us a deſcription of good ſtore of them.</p>
                     <p>After that the agglutinating Medicament hath been applied and laid to, <hi>Galen</hi> directs us to caſt round about it a new Spunge made as ſoft as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may be with ſweet Wine, or with <hi>Mulſum, i. e.</hi> Wine and Honey ſodden together; which ſaid Spunge others alſo uſe to throughly ſoak, and thereby ſil it ful with the Decoction of Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Rinds, Roſes, and the like; to wit, that it may dry it, and receive in the filthy corruption iſſuing forth of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> which might otherwiſe eaſily corrode the part, or excite and cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an intollerable itching: and this ſaid binding round about he would have to begin from the bottom of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and from thence that it tend toward the orifice. And likewiſe about the bottom thereof let Swathbands be rolled as hard and ſtreightly as may be (provided ſtil notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that it cauſe not pain) and then let them be looſened by degrees, and by little and little, until you come to the very mouth of the <hi>Sinus;</hi> in the which ſaid mouth let the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be tied unto it after a looſe manner; neither let it too cloſely ſtop up the orifice, but leave a
<pb n="2444" facs="tcp:49110:26"/> paſſage forth for the <hi>Pus</hi> or ſnotty matter; unto which end, and for which purpoſe alſo let the Emplaſter which is laid thereon have a hole cut (with a pair of Shears) in that ſame very place.</p>
                     <p>And this was the way and method uſed by the Ancients for the curing of a <hi>Sinus,</hi> and generally al ſorts of hollow winding Ulcers; and to ſpeak truth, it was ſufficiently uſeful and commodious. Yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Franciſcus Arcaeus</hi> in his ſecond Book of the Curing of Wounds, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter, tels us of another far more eaſie and compendious courſe that he himſelf had found out and diſcovered in curing Apoſtems newly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; whereby on the third, or on the fourth day at the furtheſt, all the aforeſaid Cavity of Apoſtems might be remedied, and perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by drawing together what was divided; (which operation we cal commiſſion and conglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination of the Impoſtume) ſo that nothing ſhould be left gaping, beſide the opening or inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on place, which was made by Art to the end that thereby the <hi>Pus</hi> might flow out, and be preſſed forth; and that al this ſhould be effected without any the leaſt danger to the ſick party, without much (if any) pains and labor, or any other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. Now his way and method of Curing was as followeth. If the Tumor or Apoſtem be great, then (ſaith he) in the firſt place let it be opened in the beſt manner that may be; ſo that the little finger may be put into the orifice, and that thereby al the <hi>Pus</hi> that is contained within the Impoſtume may be permitted to flow forth; and may likewiſe be thence expelled by a gentle compreſſion of the place it ſelf. The <hi>Pus</hi> being once expelled and evacuated, let the mouth of the <hi>Sinus</hi> be ſtopt with a Tent; and then an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Pillow or Cuſhion being laid and faſtened down thereon, let it ſo remain (without removal) until the next day following. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Ligature being looſened, let the Ulcer be purified and carefully cleanſed from al the <hi>Pus,</hi> if haply there be any left remaining underneath. After this is done, let a Pipe or ſmal Cane of Lead be put into the orifice; the which let it be as big and large as is the Orifice it ſelf; and let it reach even unto the Cavity or hollow place; but let it not by any means be forced any further. Upon this let the Baſilick Emplaſter ſpread upon a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Cloth be impoſed; in the which alſo the pipe may be contained, that it fal not forth; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs leave a hole at the very Orifice of the Leaden Pipe or Cane. Afterwards, on either ſide of the Cavity let there be put triangular Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows or Cuſhions (of which before) on either ſide one, ſo that al the hollow ſpace may be filled up with either Pillow, &amp;c. But let the Orifice of the <hi>Sinus</hi> in which is the Leaden Pipe be left free and open; neither let it be ſtopt up by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Pillow, nor any waies obſtructed by the Ligature or binding; that ſo al the <hi>Pus</hi> that lieth underneath may be throughly purged out: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward let the place covered by the Pillows be rolled about with a Swathband, ſo that it may be without the leaſt pain; and let it be ſo ordered, that the Ligature may begin at or from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and tend toward the orifice; that ſo by this means al the <hi>Pus</hi> or filth that is within may be forced toward the Orifice, and through it may be preſſed forth. The <hi>Sinus</hi> thus bound about is to be left in this manner until the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; on which, the Ligature being looſened, we ought by making ſtrict enquiry to find out how much of the Cavity remains; that ſo we may be throughly certified, Whether or no the aforeſaid Pillows or Cuſhions did touch upon the places. For al thoſe places which were ſubjected by the Pillows &amp;c. wil al of them be found conglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and faſt cloſed together. The which when we have diſcovered, the Pillows are again to be tied and faſtened after the ſame faſhion as they lay before; and ſo they are to continue until the next day. But now if ſo be that any of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, or of the <hi>Pus</hi> ſeems to be left in any place, this (as before) is to be preſſed forth with the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows faſtened by the Swathband; together with which the gaping place doth coaleſce and joyn cloſe together. In this manner ſo ſoon as the parts are cloſed together, let the Pillows be removed; and then let there be impoſed upon the Ulcer a Linen cloth ſpread over with the Authors <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi> Emplaſter, or ſuch other like Plaiſter, as ſuppoſe the Emplaſter <hi>Diapalma;</hi> and you may not forget to wipe and cleanſe it ſix or eight times every day.</p>
                     <p>But yet notwithſtanding, as touching this way and manner of curing the <hi>Sinus</hi> and Cavities, it is firſt to be taken notice of, that this ſame doth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed moſt happily in Apozems newly opened, and in them only: for as for an old <hi>Sinus</hi> (where all is not wel within, and which almoſt declines unto callous Ulcers and Fiſtula's) the former way and manner of curing it is far better and ſafer. Moreover, this is likewiſe to be obſerved, that we ought wel to look, whether or no there remain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny relicks of the indigeſted matter, ſpread tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-out the part; which eaſily comes to be known by ſome apparent Tumor or Swelling; as alſo by its redneſs of colour. For otherwiſe, and as long as any thing preternatural ſticks in the part, agglutination (as we term it) or cloſing up of the Orifice is not to be expected; neither is it to be ſo much as hoped for. And therefore be ſure that the <hi>Pus</hi> it ſelf be likewiſe cleanſed and purged in the beſt manner that poſſibly you can.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This alſo is to be heeded, to wit, whether or no the place may conveniently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be rolled about with Swath-bands, and likewiſe whether the aforementioned Pillows or Cuſhions be ſtreightly faſtened, and tied down cloſe enough, that ſo they may both compreſs and
<pb n="2445" facs="tcp:49110:26"/> keep down the ſevered and diſunited parts, and alſo preſs forth the <hi>Pus</hi> or filthy ſnot-like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For if ſo be that the Swath-bands gape, and that the Pillows preſs not down the part as they ought, then neither is there any <hi>Pus</hi> preſſed forth, nor doth the part coaleſce and meet together.</p>

                  <p>This Tumor is moſt an end by Phyſitians rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Cholerick. But yet there is ground and cauſe enough of doubting, from what humor it derives its beginning and Pedigree. For <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf ſeems now and then to ſtagger, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to ſtand to what he had ſpoken concerning it. For in his ſecond Book to <hi>Glauco,</hi> and firſt Chapter, he expreſly writes, that the moſt thin and hot Blood, or Choler together with Blood (to wit, when both of them are hotter than is behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) is the Cauſe of an exquiſite <hi>Eryſipelas;</hi> and there he determines that meet &amp; pure Choler is not the original efficient cauſe of this ſaid Tumor, but rather of that which we uſually call <hi>Herpes.</hi> And in his Chap. 9. concerning Tumors he aſſerts, that <hi>Herpes</hi> is bred or cauſed, when a cholerick fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (being indeed purely and exactly ſuch) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be excited, and to exulcerate the Skin; but that when this ſaid cholerick flux is mingled with a wateriſh matter and with blood, &amp; ſo is leſs ſharp, and when it rather ſwels up the part into a Tumor then exulcerates it, that then an <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas</hi> is excited. But contrariwiſe, in his Book of black Choler, Chap. 5. in his fourteenth Book of the Method of Phyſick Chap. 1, 2, 3. and B. 17. Chap. 2. in his Book of the Differences of Feavers, Chap. 5. and in his Book of the way of curing by Blood-letting, Chap. 8. and in divers other places, aſſerts that Choler is the cauſe of this Tumor: which latter opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> moſt of our Phyſitians follow.</p>
                  <p>But truly, if we lay aſide the Authorities and Opinions of the Ancients, and look wel into the thing it ſelf, and if we confer the name of an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> upon that Tumor that is ſo well and commonly known unto our Country-men; and laſtly, if we take good notice of thoſe things that dayly befall the ſick Perſons in a Diſeaſe ſo well known; we ſhall then (without any ſcruple) judg the Opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> (which he propounds unto <hi>Glauco,</hi> in his ſecond Book and Chap. 1. and in his Book of Tumors, Chap. 9) to be by far the more true and probable.</p>
                  <p>For the very colour it ſelf of the part affected (being altogether roſie) inſtructs us, that Blood rather than Choler is the cauſe of this Tumor. And although this kind of Tumor doth now and then from red or ruddy become yellowiſh, yet notwithſtanding this is not altogether true of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> but only of ſome one certain ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and difference thereof. Moreover, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor that excites and cauſeth this Tumor is not altogether ſo ſharp and tart as is Choler; and for this cauſe doth neither exulcerate, nor produce extream heat, or over vehement pain. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Blood that excites this Tumor is the thinneſt and moſt intenſely hot, and it is vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be bilious or cholerick; the ſame that <hi>Galen</hi> alſo tels us in his ſecond Book to <hi>Glauco,</hi> Chap. 1. where he writes, that Choler alone (when it lieth hid and ſecret, and conſiſts in ſome one member) doth excite and cauſe the Tumor <hi>Herpes.</hi> But then if ſo be that the fluxion ſhall be mingled, and conſiſt of blood and yellow cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, (being both of them hotter than is meet) or elſe from the blood in this manner waxing hot, and being according to its ſubſtance moſt thin, we then call it an <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi> For albeit that <hi>Galen</hi> in very many other places aſſerts an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> to proceed from Choler; yet not withſtanding, what he means and intends by Choler, he hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared in the place before alleadged. And if we conſult experience, and thoſe accidents that betide the ſick Parties, we ſhall then find that he could not intend any thing but that Choler which they term natural and alimentary or nouriſhing, that is to ſay, the hotteſt and thinneſt part of the blood, but ſuch as is now grown extreamly hot, &amp; therefore the neereſt that may be to Choler. But now, whatſoever kind of Choler we aſſign to be the cauſe of this Tumor, whether yellow, or pale, or like the ruſt of Braſs, or Leek-coloured, they wil not any of them agree with thoſe things that happen in this Tumor. Furthermore this humor hath conjoyned with it a depraved quality, and a peculiar ſort of corruption; and before ſuch time as it breaks forth it exciteth and cauſeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great ſtreights, not much unlike to thoſe that the Plague (upon the firſt invaſion) is wont to produce; and therefore the ſame kind of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xipharmaca</hi> or counterpoyſons that we make uſe of in the Peſtilence are here likewiſe to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, for the expulſion thereof.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, the words of <hi>Galen,</hi> and of other Authors (that affirm the original of this Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor to ſpring from yellow Choler) may be drawn to a better ſence; I mean, that they may be more
<pb n="2446" facs="tcp:49110:27"/> rightly interpreted, if we ſay, that by Choler is to be underſtood the natural part of the blood, which is more thin and hot, and which is very commonly called Choler; but it were more fitly and properly named a bilious or cholerick blood; the which ſo ſoon as it begins to wax intenſly hot, and to boyl, it then excites this kind of Tumor. And very frequently there is alſo herewithal ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a certain portion of a moſt ſubtile thin and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſly hot whey (the which if thou haſt a mind, and art pleaſed to cal it a bilious &amp; cholerick whey I wil not gainſay or oppoſe thee) and then there is bred an exulcerated <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> yet only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially; like as oftentimes it is wont to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the Face, when there ariſe and appear lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bladders ful of a wateriſh humor; and then the Skarf-skin alone is affected, and parts aſſunder. But if (together with it) the Skin it ſelf ſhal be exulcerated (which ever and anon chanceth in the Thighs) then we may conclude that aduſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are therewith mingled; and this kind of <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is ſaid to be, not pure, or if you will impure.</p>
                  <p>But of this Tumor enough hath been ſpoken in the ſecond Book of Feavers, Chap. 16. which here we judg it not fit to repeat, in regard that there the Reader may by peruſal be fully acquainted with what hath been written. I wil only repeat this, that the firſt riſe of this affect is from a Feaver, or move plainly, that the affect is primarily and originally a Feaver. For neither doth an <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas</hi> (or Roſa) invade the part but with a Feaver; which oftentimes a day or two before it breaks forth is wont exceedingly to afflict and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciate the ſick Perſon. But this Feaver is cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically determined (as we wont to expreſs it) and the Patient freed therefrom by means of this Tumor: and thereupon it is, that oftentimes a pain or ſome kind of ſwelling is perceived in the Glandules under the Arm-pits, or elſe in the Groyns; until that at length Nature ſhall have driven forth the matter unto ſome extream part of the Body: for then the Feaver is wont to ceaſe, albeit the Tumor is wont to ſtick and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the part affected, for a certain ſpace af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Cure, this likewiſe is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (like as it hath been more at large declared in the place before alleadged) that it ought to be altogether perfected and compleated; and we muſt uſe the utmoſt of our endeavor, that the humor (the conteining cauſe thereof) may be called forth and not retained therein; ſince that by the deteining thereof greater evils are wont to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced and made way for: which may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appear even by the example of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man (or Peaſant) mentioned by <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius,</hi> in his firſt Century, Obſerv. 82. who having an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> in his left Hand (and by the advice of a Barber-Chirurgeon for ſome daies anoynting his Hand and Arm with Oyl of Roſes) a Pain, an Inflammation, and other ſymptoms were from day to day more and more augmented; inſomuch that at length the whol Hand was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted (and altogether rendred incurable) by a Gangrene.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Bubo</hi> likewiſe appertains unto Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For a <hi>Bubo</hi> (as <hi>Galen</hi> defines it, in his Book of the Difference of Feavers, Chap. 5. and in his ſecond to <hi>Glauco,</hi> Chap. 1.) is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Glandules in the Groyns. For the Glandules being by Nature ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that unto them the ſuperfluous Humors ſhould be expelled from the principal parts; if they (and together with them the blood) ſhal chance to be thruſt forth altogether (and as it were by heaps) unto the Glandulous parts, then an Inflammation is excited; and this happens moſt an end, and eſpecially in the Groins; and ſomtimes alſo under the Arm-pits, and behind the Ears; which latter Inflammations behind the Ears are commonly termed <hi>Parotides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now, The Humors that ſtir up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Nature unto the aforeſaid expulſion being very various, hence it is that the differences ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from <hi>Bubo</hi> are likewiſe exceeding various and different. For one while the Humors are ſaid to be ſimply vitious or vitiated, ſo that they have no malignity conjoyned with them; and from theſe originally proceed thoſe <hi>Bubo's</hi> that are not malignant: but then again (otherwhiles) the matter is malignant, and thence the malignant <hi>Bubo</hi> is produced; and this again according to the variety of the malignant matter, is either pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent, or elſe that which we call venereal. But in regard that we have already treated of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent <hi>Bubo</hi> in our Book of Feavers, and that the other which we call Venereal belongs unto the Tract touching the French Pox, therefore we wil diſcourſe of the <hi>Bubo</hi> at large only, and handle it as it is in the general.</p>

From whence alſo the antecedent, yea and the external cauſes likewiſe which make for the generation of that humor are very various.

                        <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines, that ſome kind of <hi>Bubo's</hi> have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and original only from the ſtore of Blood, and that certain of them by the way of expulſion are bred from the vitious blood; and that the other Diſeaſes follow, and are excited at the time and Inſtant of the <hi>Criſis.</hi>

                     <p>When a <hi>Bubo</hi> that neither is Peſtilent nor Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal is excited (Nature unburdening her ſelf of that, whatever it be, that is offenſive and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome unto her and expelling it unto the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ignoble parts) Natures operation and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor is by no means to be hindred, nor the matter to be driven back again unto the internal parts. And firſt of al, we muſt duly weigh, whether or no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath excited the <hi>Bubo</hi> by the <hi>Criſis</hi> (and that a perfect one) and that thereupon the ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be diſcharged of the Diſeaſe, and that there be preſent and apparent the ſigns of a good <hi>Criſis</hi> or judgment; for then in this caſe (according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Precept, Book 1. Aphoriſm 20.) there ought nothing to be moved; but the whole buſineſs is to be committed to Nature; and means muſt be endeavored, that either the <hi>Bubo</hi> may be diſcuſſed, or elſe that it may moſt ſpeedily be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turated and brought to a ripeneſs. But then if in truth the <hi>Bubo</hi> be critical, and that the <hi>Criſis</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be an imperfect one, the humor is then yet further to be attracted unto the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the application of Cupping-glaſſes, or by Medicaments made of Leaven, black Soap, old Hogs greaſe, the Roſin of the Pine Tree, <hi>Diachy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> with Gums, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Again, If there be a <hi>Bubo</hi> generated, no other Diſeaſe preceding, neither then (as hath been ſaid) is Natures motion in the leaſt to be impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

                     <p>The remaining part of the Cure in al theſe <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo's</hi> which are not malignant and contagious is to be ordained and ordered like as in other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations. Yet notwithſtanding this one thing is wel to be obſerved in the firſt place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſuch Digeſtives as are adminiſtred ought to be of the ſtronger ſort, and more forcible than in other Inflammations; in regard that the Glandules are parts that are more cold than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and more ignoble than the other, and have not any exquiſite ſenſe; we adviſe therefore, that a Cataplaſm be made of Barley meal and Lupines mingled with Honey. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Roots of white Lillies, Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the wild and ſpirting Cowcumber, of each one ounce: the Leaves of Pellitory of the Wall, and Parſley Leaves, of each an ounce and half: boyl them in Wine unto a ſoftneſs, and then bruiſe them well: being throughly bruiſed and paſſed through an hair ſieve, add of the meal of Lupines two ounces: Oyl of Camomile and white Lillies, of each a ſufficient quantity, and ſo make a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Humor be not digeſted it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into <hi>Pus,</hi> and the <hi>Bubo</hi> is to be maturated or ripened; and this for the moſt part is the ſafeſt courſe. For unleſs this be done, as I have often obſerved, after ſome ſhort interval of time, a new <hi>Bubo</hi> is wont to ariſe either in the ſame or ſome other part. Now the very ſame Maturatives that are wont to be propounded and preſcribed in an Inflammation are here to take place, and to be made uſe of.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pus</hi> or filthy corrupt matter being bred, the Tumor is then to be launced, that ſo the <hi>Pus</hi> may moſt ſpeedily be evacuated; and (the truth is) the ſection or cutting ought then to be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and inſtituted (in the Groyn) in a tranſverſe or overthwart manner; ſince that the Tumor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleanſed after this faſhion, the skin may the more eaſily coaleſce and come together; becauſe that whilſt the Thigh is bending the Skin is united.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pus</hi> being evacuated and emptied forth the Ulcer is to be made clean, fleſh to be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and at length the Ulcer is to be ſhut up with a Cicatrice or Scar as we uſe to cal it.</p>

And thus the <hi>Furunculus</hi> ariſeth in the Skin, and in the fleſhy parts that are under the Skin. But there ſeldom breaks forth one alone, but for the moſt part many of them break forth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>But now of theſe <hi>Furunculu's</hi> there is a certain difference.

And then it is truly ſaid to be gentle and dangerleſs, when it reſides only in the Skin; but miſchievous and deſtructive, and not to be cured without great difficulty, whenas its Roots being deeply fixed it breaks out upon the Skin. Theſe <hi>Furunculu's</hi> are ſomtimes likewiſe ſaid to be <hi>Sporadick</hi> (that is, ſuch as here and there privately ſeize upon, and differently afflict the ſick perſon, when they come not after an ordinary manner) and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo they are Epidemick or Univerſal.</p>

                     <p>The Signs of a <hi>Furunculus</hi> are, a ſmal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Inflammation in the firſt beginning thereof, and a Puſtule or bliſter by degrees and by little and little growing forth, and ſtil tending towards an acute and ſharp point (not exceeding the bigneſs of a Pigeons Egg) with a certain kind of pain and redneſs of color, whenas it hath arrived at its ſtate and perfection; which happeneth much about the eighth, ninth, or (at the furtheſt) the tenth day; and a <hi>Furunculus</hi> differs from an Inflammation in reſpect of its ſmalneſs in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion: and then again, the matter which is in a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> or Inflammation is good blood; whereas in a <hi>Furunculus</hi> it is thick and vitious: and from a Carbuncle it differs, in that the matter of a <hi>Carbuncle</hi> is worſe and more aduſt or burnt, and thereupon attains not unto a ſuppuration; whereas a <hi>Furunculus</hi> may attain unto maturati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and may be ſuppurated.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Furunculus</hi> be Epidemical and Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential, it is then black and green; and there is preſent to accompany it a malignant Feaver, together with other evil ſymptoms.</p>

                     <p>Whereas then that a <hi>Parotis</hi> is an Inflammation, it muſt neceſſarily follow that the neereſt and containing cauſe thereof is the blood. But this blood notwithſtanding is very ſeldom pure, but moſt an end Choler, Phlegm, or Melancholy, yea,
<pb n="2451" facs="tcp:49110:29"/> oftentimes alſo there are malignant and peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial humors therewith mingled; from whence it is, that there are malignant and peſtilent <hi>Paroti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> proceeding therefrom. And it is a moſt rare thing that blood that is faulty in nothing but that there is too great ſtore thereof ſhould ſtir up and provoke Nature ſo far forth that it ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſuch a kind of excretion or ſeparation; but it happeneth from the vitious and depraved Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, by which Nature being irritated and ſtirred up is wont to thruſt forth unto the external parts ſuch like Humors together with the blood. For like as in critical bleedings (which Phyſitians u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually term <hi>Haemorrhages</hi>) it is not the blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that is principally faulty and peccant, but likewiſe the vitious humors; the which when that Nature cannot eaſily expel without the blood, ſhe thereupon aſſays and inſtitutes this Excretion, or (as we commonly term it) ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood: and this ſhe doth in ſuch a manner (to the end that ſhe may avert and turn away the vitious humors from the principal unto the more ignoble parts) that ſhe makes uſe of the blood, like as of a Vehicle or Conduit pipe. Now theſe humors are tranſmitted and ſent either from the whol body, or at leaſt from the Brain. And in good truth we have diſcovered that theſe kind of Tumors which we cal <hi>Parotides</hi> may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happen from vitious Humors bred in the body; but alſo from poyſons that ſhal by any accident be drunk or taken into the body; as (for inſtance) I remember the like done here at <hi>Wittenberg.</hi> For a certain Servant Maid (when ſhe was to boyl fiſh) unwillingly drawing water out of Veſſels into which a Bat or Dormouſe had accidentally fallen, and was therein ſuffocated and cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The principal Differences of theſe <hi>Parotides</hi> are taken from the matter, and from the manner of their Generation. From the matter, becauſe that the blood which exciteth the <hi>Parotis</hi> is either Cholerick, or Phlegmatick, or Melancholick, or in regard alſo that it hath malignant and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent humors mingled together with them. From the manner of their beginning or generation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that ſome of them have their original with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Feavers, or (as <hi>Celſus</hi> ſpeaks in his ſixth Book, and Chap. 16.) ſome of them in good and perfect health, Nature thruſting forth unto thoſe places ſome certain vitious humors either from out the whol body in general, or elſe more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and principally from the head: but then others of them appear upon Feavers; and thoſe again ſuch as are either long, or acute; and laſtly, ſuch as are either benign and inoffenſive, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe malignant and peſtilential. And this happeneth in the ſtate or declination thereof, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the <hi>Criſis</hi> driving forth the digeſted hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor (the cauſe of the Feaver) unto theſe more ignoble places; or elſe they ariſe ſymptomatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the very beginning or augmentation of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>

But then what kind of Humor it is that is mingled with the blood is known out of the ſeveral ſigns of the Humors that have been elſwhere propounded. If there be preſent a malignant or peſtilential humor, then there is evermore conjoyned therewith a Feaver of the like Nature.

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>In the Cure of the <hi>Parotides,</hi> we ought in the firſt place wel to conſider, whether they be critical or ſymptomatical; and what kind of Humor it is that they are bred of, and from which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. If the <hi>Parotis</hi> break forth critically, and ſo the diſeaſe from thenceforth be quite taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or at leaſt diminiſhed; then the whol work is to be committed to Nature (according to the Precept of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his firſt Book, and the twentieth Aphoriſm) and nothing elſe is then to be done, but only that thoſe things that mitigate pain (as they have been already propounded in the Chapter of an Inflammation) be laid thereupon; the which may likewiſe at one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant together help forward the ſuppuration. But then it muſt not be forgotten that in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotides,</hi> whether they be critical or ſymptomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; whether the matter be much or little; and whether it be benign or malignant; that however it be, yet Repellers or drivers back have no place at al (as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us in his third Book of the Compoſition of Medicaments according to the place affected, and ſecond Chapter) leſt that the matter be driven back from the more ignoble part unto that which is more noble, and eſpecially the Brain that lieth ſo neer thereunto. Yea moreover, if the Tumor break not forth ſufficiently, and the humor (that by reaſon of the diſeaſe fals and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles it ſelf in the affected part) be not by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of Nature in a ſufficient abundance thruſt forth, then in this caſe the gentler ſort of Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives (ſuch as are, the Oyl of Camomile, of Flower-de-luce, of Dill, and of Melilote) are to be made uſe of. But then the ſtronger ſort of them are not to be adminiſtred but with an eſpecial care and caution; leſt that the pain ſhould be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Natural powers and ſtrength deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p>After this we are to take notice, whether or no Nature attempt any reſolution and diſcuſſion; for which purpoſe ſhe is to be aſſiſted and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by diſcuſſive Medicaments; or elſe, whether (which indeed is alwaies far more commodious) it tends toward a ſuppuration; and in this caſe likewiſe Nature her ſelf is to be aided and holpen forward by thoſe Medicaments that promote concoction and digeſtion of the crude matter. Now the Medicaments of either ſort are before propounded (in Chap. 5.) where we treated of an Inflammation, and in the eighth Chapter where we diſcourſed concerning <hi>Bubo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſuppuration being made and paſt, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume is then to be opened, and (as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in its proper place declared) ſo to be cured.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Parotides</hi> that are Symptomatical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures endeavor (where it fals ſhort) is to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and promoted; and the overgreat abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the antecedent cauſe (if any ſuch thing be preſent) is to be leſſened and abated. For if that there be preſent either an abundant ſtore of blood, or elſe of vitious and naughty humors, we are not to fear that hereby Nature may be averted from, and hindred in her work of expulſion; but rather to expect that being eated of ſome part of her burden ſhe will afterwards the more eaſily expel that which remains and ought to be emptied forth.</p>
                     <p>If yet notwithſtanding (an evacuation of the antecedent cauſe preceding) ſhe be not as yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as ſhe ought ſufficiently to expel; then the expulſion is to be forwarded and holpen on by the application of Cupping-glaſſes, and other attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives.</p>
                     <p>And hence it is, that either a diſcuſſion of the matter, or (which indeed we uſually practiſe, as moſt requiſite) the converſion thereof into <hi>Pus</hi> or matter is to be procured by thoſe or ſuch like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments as are propounded in the eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where we treated of the <hi>Bubo</hi> Tumor. And yet notwithſtanding here in this caſe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter is to be heedfully regarded; ſo that if it be more than ordinarily cold and thick the Diſcuſſers that we uſe are to be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hotter and ſtronger; and if there be any cauſe to fear that the matter may be hardened, Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lients are likewiſe to be made uſe of.</p>
                     <p>After the ſoftening of the matter, as aforeſaid, (albeit otherwiſe the matter tend likewiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) a ſuppuration is by all means to be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and furthered, the Impoſtume to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and as we have already often declared, in this manner the Cure is to be effected.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it to be expected that this Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor ſhould be broken of its own accord, nor are we to wait til then, foraſmuch as the <hi>Pus</hi> being long reteined is oftentimes wont to produce many ſad and dangerous ſymptoms.

Unleſs any one will make this diſtinction out of <hi>Avicen,</hi> that what beginneth without puſtules and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is a Carbuncle or <hi>Pruna;</hi> but that which beginneth with puſtules, and bladders, and that likewiſe hath a moiſture flowing out of it, this may be called <hi>Ignis Perficus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Swelling is called by this name, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it hath over it a certain Cruſtineſs that is black like a Coal; for which cauſe it is alſo term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pruna,</hi> becauſe the Fleſh is black, and as it were burnt with a Coal; and moreover it is ſaid to be a Fire, in regard that the parts are burnt as by a Fire. But in truth, that which <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> have left written touching a Carbuncle ſeems yet ſcarcely in al things to anſwer to a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle in general, but only to ſome one ſpecies thereof; and haply unto a kind therof that is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical, and ſo a new Diſeaſe. For <hi>Celſus</hi> in his fifth Book, Chap. 28 thus writeth: <hi>From thoſe that befall extrinſecally we muſt now come unto ſuch things as are internally bred, ſome one part or other of their Bodies being corrupted. Among which there is none worſe than a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle: of this Carbuncle there are theſe Notes and Marks; there is a certain redneſs, and upon it there ſtand and hang out (but not very far) certain Puſhes or Puſtules, eſpecially ſuch as are black, and ſomtimes black and blewiſh or Lead-color'd, or Pale. In theſe there ſeems to be a rottenneſs and filth; beneath the colour is black: the Body it ſelf is dry, and more hard than it ought to be. About the which ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle there is as it were a Cruſt, and this is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by an Inflammation, neither can the Skin in that place be poſſibly lift up, but it is as it were fixed and cloſe faſtned unto the Fleſh underneath it. The ſick Perſon is extream ſleepy; and ſomtimes there ariſeth a certain kind of horror, or elſe a Feaver, or both. And this Evil creepeth along, there being drawn out as it were certain roots, ſomtimes more ſpeedily, and ſomtimes more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and likewiſe above when it firſt proceedeth forth it looketh of a whitiſh colour, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly it becometh Lead-coloured; and about it there ariſe little Puſhes or Puſtules. And if it happen to light upon the part neer the Stomack, and the Jaws, it then oftentimes ſuddenly ſtoppeth the Breath:</hi> thus far <hi>Celſus.</hi> But now <hi>Pliny</hi> (in his Book 26.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> Expreſly referreth it unto Diſeaſes new and never known before, and writeth likewiſe that they ariſe in the moſt hidden parts of the Body, and for the moſt part under the Tongue; that it is without pain, without itching, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſymptoms then ſleep; with which ſuch as are ſurprized are deprived of life in three daies

                     <p>The Conteining Cauſe of a Carbuncle (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the aſſection even of <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, in his Book of Tumors, Chap. 6. and in his ſecond to <hi>Glauco,</hi> Chap. 1. and his 14. of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 10) is a blood fervently hot, and thick, which (in his Book of black Choler, Chap. 4, and 5.) he affirmeth to be black Choler. To wit (as we may gather out of his ſecond Book of the Differences of Feavers, Chap. 19.) a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle ariſeth from a fervent thick Blood, putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and degenerating into the Nature of black Choler, or having black Choler mingled with it, and for the moſt part a certain malignity conjoyned therewithal. This Swelling although it may be generated in the Body by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and by degrees aſſume this ill and depraved Nature; yet notwithſtanding when it hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any degree of the ſaid pravity and malignity, it is then by Nature inſtantly and ſuddenly driven forth from the interior unto the exterior parts, that is to ſay, from the more noble members unto thoſe that are leſs noble and worthy. Which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe happeneth when the Blood is infected and corrupted by reaſon of ſome external Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; from whence it is, that a Carbuncle is never excited by the Congeſtion or heaping up of blood; but is evermore generated by a defluxion that is al at once made: and thereupon it is deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly accounted among Inflammations, and is ſaid to be very neer neighboring unto a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> or <hi>Inflammation.</hi> Neither is it only generated of black Choler, like as a Cancer, but it is bred by aduſt and burnt blood, degenerating into black Choler, or elſe having black Choler mingled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>

But before theſe Puſtules break forth there is a certain itching felt in the part, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there is one or more Puſtules ariſing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing: yet notwithſtanding the Carbuncle ſomtimes beginneth without any manner of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtule, and a cruſty Ulcer is excited, the cruſtineſs being one while ſomwhat blackiſh, another while having in it the reſemblance of the color of Aſhes; and then again in a very ſhort ſpace after it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth, and becometh like unto Bubo's, after a round acute figure, with an extraordinary great heat, burning and pain; al which are eſpecially exaſperated about the Evening; and then they ſo vex the ſick party that he can hardly withhold his hands, but that he muſt be rubbing of the part; from which rubbing there afterward ariſe very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the aforeſaid Puſtules. The fleſh that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth round about them waxeth hot, and hath in it at the heighth an extream great and burning heat; it likewiſe obtaineth a color ſomwhat blacker than is that in an Eryſipelas and a Phlegmone, like as if there were ſomthing of black choler mingled together with the red. There happen moreover o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Symptoms beſides the former, to wit, a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which (as <hi>Galen</hi> alſo teſtifieth in his four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Book of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 10) infeſteth thoſe that are ſurprized with a Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, more than thoſe that are affected with a Phlegmone or Eryſipelas; a nauſeouſneſs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a vomiting, a dejection of the Appetite, a trembling with a panting and beating of the heart,
<pb n="2455" facs="tcp:49110:31"/> frequent faintings and ſwoundings, dotage; all which ſaid ſymptoms do ſo much the more afflict and grieve the party, by how much the matter is the more malignant.</p>
                     <p>For there is a certain difference even of thoſe Carbuncles themſelves, not only in regard that with the aforeſaid aduſt blood (which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct cauſe of the Carbuncle) there is ſomtimes this, another while that humor mingled; but more eſpecially, in that one Carbuncle is Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and another not Peſtilent. For albeit eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Carbuncle be malignant, by reaſon of the hot Matter, being aduſt and putrefying (which hath in it a power and quality to corrupt the fleſh, and cannot wel return into any more benign or better nature; neither may it wel be ſuppurated:) yet notwithſtanding every of them is not Peſtilent; neither hath every of them any adventitious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, but ſometimes only beſides the Native malignity of the Carbuncle there chanceth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe another kind of malignity from the common ſtate, or the contagion of the Air. But now a Peſtilent Carbuncle is diſcerned from that that is not Peſtilent, firſt of al by the preſent Peſtilent conſtitution of the Air. For it is hardly poſſible that a Carbuncle ſhould ariſe at ſuch time as the ſaid Peſtilent Conſtitution is predominant, which in it ſelf ſhould not be Peſtilent. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over al the ſymptoms and ſigns that appear in the Carbuncle are both more frequent, and more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in a Peſtilent Carbuncle, than in a Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that is not peſtilent. For even the Feaver al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo which is adjoyned unto the Carbuncle reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth and carrieth along with it a Peſtilent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and although it ſeem outwardly to be more moderate and gentle than that which appeareth in the Carbuncle that is not Peſtilent (yea, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo that it can hardly be perceived) yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding at that very time it the more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the inward parts, and is by far the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: the freſh color of the face is changed, the tongue becometh black, and is dry; the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Belly are liquid and cholerick, the appetite is dejected; there is likewiſe preſent a nauſeouſneſs, and a vomiting of the moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and the worſt humors; a difficulty of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, a ſtinking breath; and there is alſo much ſweat, and this is either ſomwhat hot, or elſe (as we term it) a cold ſweat. The ſleep is ſomtimes very ſound, and ſomtimes watchings infeſt the ſick party; dotings alſo accompany the ſame, as likewiſe faintings and ſwooning fits. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is that there is more danger threatned by one Carbuncle, than there is by another. For although every Carbuncle be not pernicious; yet notwithſtanding (as <hi>Galen</hi> teſtifieth in the 3. of his Epidem. Comment. 3. tit. 2.) the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious of al is the Peſtilent, or that which beſides its own proper and particular malignity hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo adjoyned with it that which the conſtitution of the Air bringeth along with it, and which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all thoſe pernicious ſymptoms: which if they remit very much of their former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſneſs and vigor, there is then left remaining ſome hope of ſafety and recovery; but if from day to day they are heightened and become more vehement, there is then no ſafety or hopes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape to be expected.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. By how much the blacker the Carbuncle is, by ſo much the worſe is it, as being ſuch as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the moſt corrupt blood. The next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this is the wan and yellowiſh. Thoſe that are leſs malignant, and conſequently the leſs to be feared, are ſuch as have in them a reddiſh color; to wit, ſuch in which the blood hath not as yet altogether loſt and changed its Nature, but that it hath as yet retained ſomwhat of its native heat and color.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe Carbuncles likewiſe that are ſmal are leſs pernicious than thoſe that are great; and from a very little Puſtule they ſuddenly acquire and get an extraordinary greatneſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And ſo are likewiſe thoſe that are alone, than ſuch as have other Carbuncles conjoyned with them.</p>

For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being transferred unto the more inward parts often (if not evermore) proveth deſtructive and deadly.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There are ſome alſo who conceive that this is likewiſe throughly to be conſidered, to wit, Whether the Peſtilent Carbuncle ariſe before the Feaver, or elſe whether or no the Peſtilent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver going before it at length break forth. For they conceive that the Carbuncle that breaketh forth before a Paſtilent Feaver is more ſafe (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that no Symptoms follow thereupon) in regard it is an evidence that Nature is ſtrong, and able to expel the Peſtilent Poyſon before the Feaver, ere ever it can ſeize and ſurprize the heart. And (on the other ſide) that to be more dangerous which at length breaketh forth after a Peſtilent Feaver, foraſmuch as (the Heart being ſeized upon) it hath its original from the poyſon and the corrupt humors now diffuſing themſelves into al parts of the body.</p>

But here moſt eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſtrength and natural powers are to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and we are wel to conſider whether they be ſtrong, or elſe but weak. For that ſtrength that is but weak and languiſhing may be ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered and vanquiſhed even by a ſmal Diſeaſe. Whereas (on the contrary) that that is more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous oftentimes overcometh and maſtereth even

                     <p>The Indications in a Peſtilent Carbuncle are different from thoſe in a Carbuncle not peſtilent. In a Peſtilent <hi>Carbo</hi> or Carbuncle the fervent heat of the blood is wholly al the body over to be reſtrained; and withal, the Heart at the ſame time is to be fortified againſt that malignity, which (as we have ſaid) is here very ſeldom ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The reſt of the Cure is to be directed unto the Carbuncle it ſelf. But now in a Peſtilent Carbuncle there is a more poyſonous and peſtilent quality appearing than in the fervent heat of the blood; yet neither is this to be ſleighted or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>

                  <div type="cure">
                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>And therefore (as to what belongeth unto the Cure of a Carbuncle) there are two things that we are eſpecially to regard and have an eye unto; the Antecedent Cauſe, or the fervent and corrupt blood that is in the whol body; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct Cauſe, or that ſame Humor that now exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Carbuncle. A convenient Diet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being ordained, and a moderation obſerved in thoſe things we cal not natural, the extream fervent heat of the blood is by opening a Vein to be taken away. And yet this Veneſection is not raſhly to be made uſe of in al manner of Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; but if it hath any place at al, it is moſt chiefly in that that is not peſtilent; touching which likewiſe that aſſertion of <hi>Galen</hi> (in his fourteenth Book of the Method of Phyſick) and of other Authors (who conceive that the blood is to be drawn forth even until the ſick perſon faint and ſwoon) is to be underſtood. But in a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Carbuncle nothing is raſhly to be attempted, that may weaken and deject the Natural powers, (of which there ought to be the moſt ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had in the plague, and in peſtilent Feavers) amongſt the which Veneſection unto fainting and ſwounding is not the laſt (but rather the firſt) which together with the Spirits evacuateth that humor that is moſt agreeable and friendly to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and even that moſt excellent and precious Treaſury of the life. Nay indeed moreover, even ſomtimes when the peſtilent Carbuncle is juſt then breaking forth, we cannot ſafely enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and ordain Phlebotomy. For whereas the Carbuncle ſomtimes breaketh forth, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon the very firſt invaſion of the Plague, and peſtilential Feavers, but often afterward on the fourth daies (or haply on ſome other daies) the Natural powers wil not then bear the ſaid Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſection, in regard that they are now dejected by the diſeaſe, and have therefore entered the Liſts, &amp; are now conflicting with the ſaid diſeaſe. But now what Veins are to be opened, ſufficiently appeareth from that which we have ſpoken above, touching the evacuation of the blood, &amp; touching Revulſion, and Derivation, in the Cure of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation. This only is here to be obſerved, that we muſt beware, leſt that whilſt we evacuate the blood, we do not lead and draw the ſame either unto any noble Member, or elſe through any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Member, leſt that the ſaid Member ſhould be affected with its malignity.</p>
                     <p>And therefore we ſay that that Vein is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, by means whereof the blood may rather be drawn toward the part affected than drawn back from it. Wherefore if the Carbuncle ſhal be about the Head, or the Arm-holes, or in the Breaſt, the neereſt Vein in the Arm of the ſame ſide is then to be opened. But if it be below the Liver, then the Ankle Vein, or the Ham Vein of the ſame ſide. And this Phlebotomy ought to be put in practice inſtantly, and in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before the Feaver get ſtrength, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vigor be too much dejected.</p>
                     <p>But now in regard that by this blood-letting the naughty corrupt humors can ſcarcely be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, therefore ſome conceive that there is need of purgation, by which the ſaid depraved humors may be evacuated, leſt otherwiſe the Native heat ſhould be ſuffocated and extinguiſhed by them; and that Nature may afterward the more rightly moderate the expulſion; and that ſo the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected may not be corrupted by the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Humor flowing thereto.</p>
                     <p>But then we ought to be extraordinary careful, leſt that by the purging Medicament, the Humor that Nature endeavoreth to thruſt forth unto the external parts be drawn unto the internal: and this is moſt of al to be feared in a peſtilent Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle. We conceive indeed that it may more ſafely be ordained and appointed in a Carbuncle that is not malignant. But when a Feaver is therewith joyned (and that an acute one) the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the matter then for the moſt part forbids it; and to ſpeak truth, there is hardly a Carbuncle to be found in which there is not ſomthing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity; and therefore the malignant matter is with more ſafety thruſt forth unto the ſuperficies of the body by thoſe Medicaments we term <hi>Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmaca,</hi> then drawn to the more inward parts by Medicaments that purge.</p>
                     <p>That fervent heat alſo of the aduſt blood is to be altered; and the malignity to be oppoſed by convenient Medicaments, as the juyce of Citron, of Pomegranates, Sorrel, Borrage, Bugloſs, Water Germander, Succory, and the like; with which (in a peſtilent Carbuncle) other Alexipharmaca may alſo be firly mingled. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Conſerve of Sorrel, Borrage, Bugloſs, of each one ounce and half; the ſpecies of Diamar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garit. frigid. Confection of Hyacynth, Elect. de Gem. of each half a dram; of candied Citron rind ſix drams; the candied roots of Scorzonera (or Vipers Graſs) half an ounce; with the juyce of Citron make an Electuary.</hi>

                     <pb n="2457" facs="tcp:49110:32"/>
                     <p>Unto which (in a Peſtilent Carbuncle) we may add Bole-armenick, <hi>Terra Sigillata</hi> or ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Earth, Harts horn, Bezoar ſtone, and the like. Very many there be that in a Carbuncle do much commend <hi>Scabious,</hi> and they conceive that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ought to be paſſed by; and they write, that either the Juyce, or the Water, or the Decoction thereof, is of ſingular uſe and benefit in a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle.</p>
                     <p>It wil not likewiſe be amiſs to fence and guard the Heart with Topicks, by Epithems that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe known, applied to the Region of the Heart and the Pulſes; that ſo by all manner of means the Heart may be preſerved ſafe and ſound from all the malignity.</p>
                     <p>Afterward (as for what concerns the conjunct cauſe, or the Tumor it ſelf) the way and means of curing a Carbuncle is not altogether the ſame as in other Inflammations, unleſs haply there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be in it very little of an offenſive quality. Neither muſt we make uſe of Repellers (but the malignant and poyſonous matter is rather to be attracted from the more inward unto the external parts) unleſs perhaps they may be adminiſtred for the mitigating of the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the pain; touching which more hereafter. And therefore ſo ſoon as Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection hath been adminiſtred, the part affected is forthwith to be ſcarified, and that likewiſe with lancings that go deep enough, that ſo the corrupt, malignant, and poyſonous blood (which unleſs it be inſtantly emptied forth of the part affected corrupteth the parts neer adjoyning) may be quite drawn forth. Immediately upon this the part affected is to be cleanſed and throughly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with warm ſalt water, or with ſome other convenient liquor, leſt that the blood ſhould clod, and ſo grow together in the part. Now if the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt blood ſeem not as yet to be ſufficiently eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, the ſcarifications ought then to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. We are likewſe allowed (when the place is ſcarified) to apply thereto Cupping-glaſſes or Leeches. Yet notwithſtanding i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſuch is the following Cataplaſm:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Arnogloſs</hi> (we commonly term it Lambs-tongue, or Way-bread) <hi>Lentiles, Bread that is neither wholly purged from its bran, neither yet ſuch as is altogether branny, of all theſe a like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; let them boyl in Water or Wine, and ſo make a Cataplaſm:</hi> which is to be applied twice or thrice every day.</p>
                     <p>But now this ſaid Medicament that we have mentioned, or ſuch like, is not to be impoſed and laid upon the very Carbuncle it ſelf, but only neer about it, ſome three fingers diſtance from it. For by this means the malignant matter it ſelf is not driven back, but only the extream heat and pain is mitigated, the flux of matter is ſomwhat retarded; and hereby is prevented the retreating back again of the matter unto the more inward parts. But yet neither muſt this be paſſed over in ſilence, that it is not evermore requiſite to fence the Carbuncle with ſuch a guard: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this for the moſt part i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Moreover, the place being ſcarified, there are not to be applied thoſe Medicaments that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are wont to be laid on (in regard that they promote and further the <hi>Pus</hi> or purtilent matter, and by this means may encreaſe the putrefaction and rottenneſs; ſince that a Carbuncle in putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying evermore creepeth and ſpreadeth ſo that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often a Mortification chanceth unto ſuch parts; but rather thoſe Medicaments that are drying, and ſuch as reſiſt putrefaction. For which end and purpoſe we may adminiſter the Paſtils, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, of <hi>Andro, Muſa, Polyidas,</hi> and <hi>Paſio;</hi> which are to be diſſolved firſt of al in Wine, and then alſo afterward in Vinegar; touching which ſee <hi>Galen</hi> in his Compoſition of Medicaments in general, the fifth Book, Chap. 11, and 12. They commonly likewiſe make uſe of the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiack Unguent. There may alſo be made a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm of the Meal of the Pulſe Orobus with Oxymel. <hi>Morſus Diaboli</hi> or Devils-bit, is likewiſe very much commended; if while it is yet green and wel bruiſed it be laid on; or elſe boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Wine and drunk. There be many like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that here make uſe of thoſe things that are experimentally found to be helpful by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of their ſubſtance; among which <hi>Scabious</hi> is eſpecially commended, as alſo <hi>Morſus Diaboli</hi> or Devils-bit; they take (to wit) the <hi>Scabious</hi> whileſt it is green, and bruiſe it wel, and then they add thereto the Yelk of an Egg, Hogs greaſe that is old, and a little Salt; and herewith they make a Cataplaſm; which is often to be renewed. Some likewiſe take the Herb Comfry for the ſame uſe, and with it they prepare and make ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament as this that followeth:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Juyce of the greater Symphytum (or great Comfrey) Scabious, Cranes-bill (or Doves-foot) of each one ounce: of Barley Meal two ounces and an half; and mingle them for a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others there are who (if there be preſent an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream heat and pain) commend this, Viz.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Plantane Leaves, and Sorrel Leaves,
<pb n="2458" facs="tcp:49110:33"/> of each two handfuls, boyl them to a ſoftneſs; then let them be bruiſed; when they are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bruiſed, add to them the Yelks of four Eggs, Treacle two drams, Barley meal a ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and ſo make a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many likewiſe there are that commend thoſe Wallnuts that are old and Oyly, being bruiſed; of the which ſome make ſuch a Cataplaſm as this that followeth.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Kernels of Walnuts (ſuch as are old, and rancid or mouldy) in number three; dried Figs, and Raiſins, an equal proportion; boyl them in ſtrong white Wine to a ſoftneſs, and then bruiſe them; adding thereto a dram of Salt, and two Yelks of Eggs; mingle, and then make a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now if there be any that wil not endure Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification; or if otherwiſe the Carbuncle wil not yeild unto theſe Medicaments; and it be ſo, that the corruption, the blackneſs, and the ſigns ſeem alwaies to be augmented; we muſt in this caſe have recourſe unto Cauteries; and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanly and with all poſſible ſpeed,<note place="margin">Cauteries.</note> for even the leaſt delay may caſt the ſick Perſon into an extream peril, yea into the greateſt danger even of death it ſelf. But here Potential Cauteries may not ſo ſafely be adminiſtred; in regard that the Cruſt which is drawn over them ſals off more; and ſo the exhalation of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and malignant humor it hardened. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual is therefore by moſt accounted the ſafer. For why, the Actual Cautery, by the heat and drineſs of the Fire, doth eſpecially reſiſt putrefaction, and preſerveth the ſound parts, leſt that they alſo ſhould be infected with putridneſs; and it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe attracteth from the depth and the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom all the malignant and corrupt Matter; and for this cauſe it is hereby the moſt commended as the moſt effectual Remedy; who conceive that here (in this caſe) this is not ſo grievous a Remedy, ſeeing that the ſick Perſon is hardly ſenſible of it, in regard that the Fleſh is dead; and becauſe that the uſe of it muſt be ſo long continued, even until in all parts thereof there be a ſenſe of pain. Yet notwithſtanding even the Actuall Cautery hath alſo in this diſcommodity, that it induceth and cauſeth a Cruſt or Eſchar, which it ſelf ſo hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the malignant and poyſonous matter cannot exhale. If therefore any will uſe this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he muſt be altogether careful, that the Cruſt drawn over it hinder not the exhalation of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and malignant humor; and therupon he muſt uſe his endeavor, that the Cruſt may ſpeedily (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven within the ſpace of twenty four hours) be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; in regard that there may be danger in the delaying thereof. And indeed (for this purpoſe) they commonly uſe Butter, the Suet or Fat of a Hog, the Fat of a Gooſe, and ſuch like moiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſuppurating Remedies. But the Truth is, that <hi>Horatius Augenius</hi> and <hi>Gulielmus Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius</hi> do rightly inform us, that (in thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the which there is otherwiſe ſo extream a danger threatned from putridneſs) theſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may not with any ſafety at all be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred; foraſmuch as by their humidity, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſtick virtue, they do in a wonderfull manner encreaſe the putridneſs, &amp; cauſe that the rottenneſs and corruption of the part creep ſo much the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and moreover theſe do but very ſlowly take away the Cruſtineſs. And therfore theſe conceive that we ought rather to uſe thoſe Remedies that do greatly cleanſe and dry, reſiſt putrefaction, and break aſſunder thoſe ſmal ſlender fibres by which the Cruſt adhereth unto the part affected. <hi>Galen</hi> (in his ſecond Book to <hi>Glauco,</hi> Chap. 9.) for the taking away of the Cruſt (after burning) in the caſe of a Gangrene, uſeth the Juyce of a Leek with Salt. <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius</hi> for the falling off of the Eſchar, and for the cleanſing of the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer commendeth this following Unguent.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the meal of</hi> Orobus <hi>(or bitter Vetch) the root of Ariſtolochy, or Birthwort, the Flower-de-luce of Florence, and the leſſer vernal Gentian, of each half an ounce; Treacle two drams, with a ſufficient quantity of Honey of Roſes; and ſo make <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Horatius Augentius</hi> commendeth this.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Vitriol two drams, the beſt Honey half an ounce, Hogs greaſe two drams, and mingle them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that the Ancients did not alwaies uſe moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriers and thoſe Remedies that forward the <hi>Pus</hi> or Purulent matter, for the removal of the Cruſts, is ſufficiently evident out of <hi>Galen</hi> his ſixth Book of the Compoſition of Medicaments according to the place affected, Chap. 6. and <hi>Paulus Aegine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> his fourth Book, and Chap. 19. in the which ſaid place there are many more ſuch like Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>And as for my own part, I had rather (for the taking away of the Cruſts which for the moſt part the Carbuncle contracteth) uſe ſuch like Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, then Cauteries, whether Potential or Actual. For here the Putridneſs is not ſimple, as in a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, and other corruption of the parts (where that that is putrid is moſt commonly ſeparated from the ſound part; ſo that we may ſafely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough burn away what is corrupt and putrid. But in a Carbuncle there is preſent a malignant humor, and that diffuſed throughout the whole part; and therefore we are to make uſe of thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that extract, that ſo by this means what is as yet ſound may be preſerved from purridneſs and Corruption. <hi>Aetius</hi> writeth, that wild Rue impoſed in a Cataplaſm with Honey and Raiſius of the Sun, doth likewiſe inſtantly ſeparate the Cruſts of Carbuncles: and therefore even thoſe medicaments alſo that reſiſt malignity (as Treacle and the like) are for the moſt part very properly herewith mingled. And therefore we conceive that the Unguent of <hi>Gulielmus Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> erewhile mentioned, is exceeding profitable
<pb n="2459" facs="tcp:49110:33"/> in a Carbuncle, not only after the burning, but likewiſe at all other times. Others compound ſuch a like medicament, which (as they affirm) wil in two daies ſpace ſeparate the good and ſound Fleſh from the corrupt.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Rue one handful, Leaven one ounce, dry Figs three in number, Pepper a dram, Salt a dram and half; make a Cataplaſm which may be applied mornings and evenings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In general, in Peſtilent Carbuncles, to extract the Poyſon we muſt prevent and hinder the cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and further ſpreading of the putridneſs.</p>
                     <p>For the taking off the Scar this Emplaſter is principally commended.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the beſt Treacle, and Mithridate, of each half an ounce, Leaven and Turpentine of each two ounces, Honey of Roſes one ounce and half, freſh Butter two ounces, common Salt one ounce, Chimney Soot two ounces and half, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racen Soap three ounces, Saffron three drams, three Yelks of Eggs, bake them altogether, and make an Emplaſter.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Scabious, the greater Comfrey, of each two ounces, of ful and fat Figs dryed three, an Onion roaſted in Embers, Squils half an ounce, Raddiſh root cut into ſmal pieces two ounces, two Yelks of Eggs, Salt two ounces, Leaven and Chimney Soot of each one ounce, Honey &amp; Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, of each as much at wil ſuffice; and ſo make a Cataplaſm: and having ſpread it upon a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Cloath lay it on hot, and let it be ſhifted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every hour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If now we perceive the Cruſt to become round and a circular redneſs appearing, it is then a ſign &amp; token of enſuing health and recovery, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt teſtimony that Nature hath now ſeparated the corrupt from the ſound. When the Cruſt is wholly taken away the Ulcer is then to be throughly cleanſed with <hi>Honey of Roſes, and the Juyce of Smallage,</hi> and ſuch like. After the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it is to be filled up, joyned together, and at length with a Cicatrice to be ſhut up.

He firſt of al a little fomenteth the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with Cows Milk in which Camomil flowers, Melilot flowers, the ſeeds of Fenugreek and Quinces were firſt boyled. And then by little and little he diſſected the ſuperficies of the Skin. The Skin being ſhaven away, there appeared ſmal red ſpots; which being cut with the edg of a knife, he findeth under the Skin a drop or two of red Water. That being evacuated, he applied a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Cloth dipt and moiſtened in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> in which there was diſſolved a little Treacle. By thus doing he ſoon qualified and quite took away the pain; and by this one only Remedy the very next day the finder was healed.</p>
                     <p>And likewiſe in another Matron, that for three daies together by reaſon of the vehement pain of the Patonychia could not ſleep, not take any reſt at al (the skin being ſhaven off) he findeth under the skin in the very tip of the finger, a ſpot of this bigneſs O, in the which there was contained ſcarcely one ſmal drop of the Ichorous excrement. The ſpot being opened, &amp; thereto applied Cotton dipt in <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> wherein there was Treacle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and about the whol hand and wriſt a linen cloth (after it had been firſt wel ſoaked in vinegar and water) doubled and wrapped, the pain imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ceaſed; inſomuch that the very next day following the finger was fully and perfectly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

For the Skin in that place is of an extraordinary thickneſs; ſo that the matter of the <hi>Paronychia</hi> (which in it ſelf is malignant) when it can by no means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale, it then acquireth the greater acrimony and poyſonfulneſs; and the finger alſo, yea, and the whol hand (by reaſon of the vehemency of pain) is ſwoln and blown up: and this inciſion very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing availeth, unleſs that the matter be firſt concocted and converted into <hi>Pus.</hi>

                  <p>THere is alſo found a peculiar kind of Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marion, which they term <hi>Perniones;</hi> the Greeks cal this Affect <hi>Chimethlon</hi> and <hi>Chemeith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
                     <pb n="2461" facs="tcp:49110:34"/> (from the Greek word <hi>Cheimon</hi>) in regard of their appearing in the Winter time only. And it is ſuch a kind of Inflammation as in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time ariſeth in the heels, and on the toes and fingers. I once likewiſe ſaw a Noble-man that had ſuch a kind of Inflammation on the very tip of his Noſe.</p>

                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>Now this kind of Inflammation ariſeth from the Winters cold, whileſt that by it not only the part is weakened and made more apt to receive, but that likewiſe from the pain there is cauſed an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of blood unto the part.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding this is worth conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how it cometh to paſs that he who hath in the Winter time undergone and ſuffered ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cooling of the extream parts ſhould yet notwithſtanding be wel, and altogether inſenſible of it during the Summer, and the Winter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again (and thus to continue for ſome yeers, and until the Malady be wholly removed and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by cure) ſhould be ſo ſenſible of an extream itching, pain, and ſwelling in the part that was over cooled as aforeſaid; and that although in the Summer time he felt no ill, inſtantly in the very firſt entrance of the Winter the Malady ſhould again get head and return, and an itching be again felt in the part affected: al which argueth that there was ſome ſtrong impreſſion left behind in the part. For thoſe that are thus greatly cooled do not only ſuffer a bare alteration; but that there is likewiſe ſomthing that is ſubſtantial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto the part affected, appeareth even by this. That Apples and Eggs when they are frozen, if they be caſt into cold Water, there is then an Ice taken out of them, ſo that it outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſticketh faſt unto them like unto a cruſt, and then theſe Apples and Eggs return again to their former Natural ſtate; whereas on the contrary, if they be put into warm Water, they become flaggy, turn black, and are corrupted; which notwithſtanding could not poſſibly happen if there were only a meer and ſimple alteration; and therefore we may conclude, that by the pain that afflicteth the part there is blood attracted to the part affected, that exciteth and cauſeth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.</p>

                     <head>The Preſervation.</head>
                     <p>Leſt that the parts ſhould be hurt by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cold, it is requiſite that in the Winter time they ſhould be ſufficiently fenced and provided for againſt the injuries of the aforeſaid external cold Air. And more particularly (leſt that the feet be hurt) it wil be expedient to wear Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harneſſes (as they cal them) or linen Socks wel moiſtened in the Spirit of Wine, eſpecially in that part of them by which they cover the feet. But ſeeing that it cannot wel be that al the parts ſhould be ſufficiently kept from and defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the cold, yet notwithſtanding, leſt that any one (after he hath for a while been in the cold Air) ſhould ſuffer any dammage, the refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted parts are not firſt of al to be altered with the contrary quality; but rather we ought to do our endeavor, that the cauſe which hath inſinuated it ſelf into any part may be removed and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And therefore (as it is commonly wont to be done in the cold Septentrional Regions; and of which as of a thing very wel known, <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius</hi> takes notice in his Treatiſe of a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> and <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> Chap. 10.) the refrigerated part is not to be put cloſe to the fire, neither are thoſe things that are hot to be impoſed thereon; (for if this be done, the coldneſs, or indeed rather the cold Atomes retained in the part being by this means thruſt down into the deeper parts of the place affected, a moſt intollerable pain hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth thereupon to ariſe, yea and ſomtimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Gangrene is produced and excited) but the cooled part is to be wel rubbed with Snow that ſo by its like the coldneſs (or cold thing) may be extracted out of the affected part, after the ſame manner as Apples or Eggs being frozen and caſt into the coldeſt water are reſtored unto their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Nature, the extracted Ice ſticking faſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unto the rinds of the one, and ſhels of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for this very reaſon the Inbabitants of the abovementioned Northern Regions, when they have been travelling do not accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to enter into Stoves or Hot-houſes, or ſo much as to draw neer unto any fire, until they have firſt throughly rubbed their Hands, Noſe, and the extream parts (or tips) of their Ears with Snow; or have plunged (as we may ſo ſay) their almoſt frozen feet into cold Water, or
<pb n="2462" facs="tcp:49110:35"/> Snow. And the ſame <hi>Fabricius</hi> (in the place alleadged) relateth, That a Noble man of good eſteem and reputation told him, that when he travelled in thoſe Regions he himſelf on a time lighted upon one travelling as he was upon the Road; whom finding to be ſtiff with cold and almoſt dead he cauſed to be put into a Cart; and having brought him into an Iune, his Hoſt (the man of the houſe) immediately plunged him over head and ears, as we ſay, in cold water; which was no ſooner done, but inſtantly there iſſued forth from al parts of him a kind of froſtineſs, in ſuch a manner that his whol body ſeemed as if it had been al over covered with Ice, like as with an Iron ſhield: and then he gave him to drink a Cup of Hydromel, putting thereinto the pouder of Cinnamom, Cloves, and Mace; upon which he fel into a ſwear in his Bed; and ſoon after the ſick perſon returned unto his former ſtate, and became perfectly wel recovered.</p>

It wil be likewiſe very commodious (this being a remedy that is alſo very wel known) to thruſt deep into warm Water (in which Rape Roots, eſpecially thoſe that were formerly congealed and frozen with cold have been boyled) the Hands or the Feet.

                  <p>THere is likewiſe ſomtimes poured forth blood (the Skin continuing ſtil whol and ſound) into the ſpaces of the parts; from whence there ariſeth an Affect, which by the Greeks is termed <hi>Ecchymoma</hi> or <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> and by the Latines <hi>Effuſio, Suffuſio, Sugillatio.</hi> For an <hi>Ecchymoſis</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>Chymeon ecchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> that is, an <hi>Effuſion</hi> or pouring forth of the Humors, to wit, the blood, into the next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning ſpaces, by reaſon of the opening of the Veins; to wit, if the Skin abiding whol the Veins pour forth that juyce which they contain, that is the blood, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaketh in his ſecond Book of Fractures, Comment. 16. and either the orifices of the Veſſels gape (which happeneth in an Anaſtomoſis) or elſe the blood doth as it were ſweat forth and ſtrain it ſelf out through the Tunicles of the Veſſels being rarefied; which the Greeks cal <hi>Diapedeſis;</hi> or elſe by contuſion the Veſſels are looſened; which chanceth if one fal from an high place, or elſe be oppreſſed and over laid by the weight of ſomthing that is heavy ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him; or elſe be ſmitten and hurt with a club, ſtone, ſtump of a Tree; or elſe laſtly, that by ſome violent motion and extenſion a Veſſel be broken. Then (the Skin remaining who) the blood is poured forth into the neer adjoyning ſpaces; whereupon the color of the part is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and at firſt indeed it ſeemeth reddiſh; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it becometh Leaden colored, then yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh, green, blackiſh: whereupon it is that <hi>Galen,</hi> in his Book of Preternatural Tumors, Chap. 10. and tenth Book of the Compoſition of ſimple Medicaments, Chap. 9. maketh two ſpecies of this <hi>Ecchymoſis;</hi> one (which by the general name he calleth <hi>Ecchymoma</hi>) when the part obtaineth a middle color betwixt red and black; which indeed may properly be termed <hi>Pelidna,</hi> that is, of a livid or leaden color; and the Affect may likewiſe be called <hi>Livor,</hi> to wit, paleneſs, or wanneſs: the other he termeth <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſmata,</hi> that is, blackneſſes; which latter are eſpecially familiar unto old perſons, as often as their Veins are bruiſed, or opened upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, and theſe happen upon any ſmal or ſleight occaſion; like as on the contrary, <hi>Pelidna</hi> and <hi>Livores</hi> befal Children and thoſe that are young, and Women, and ſuch as are of a white color.</p>
                  <pb n="2463" facs="tcp:49110:35"/>
                  <p>But now, although oftentimes, and indeed for the moſt part, the part is not lift up into a Tumor or Swelling, but the Blood poured forth doth ſo inſinuate it ſelf into the ſpaces of the parts that there is no Tumor at all appearing: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſomtimes the part doth ſwell up, if there be great ſtore of Blood poured out; and this alſo is now and then wont to happen after Venefecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit, if the whol Vein be ſmitten, or if the Wound that is in the Skin ſhall be cloſed up, but that which is in the Vein it ſelf left open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhut. For from hence by that Wound that is in the Vein the blood is poured forth, for which when there is no iſſue or paſſage open (the Wound in the Skin being cloſed up) it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under the Skin poured out into the whole Arm; and ſomtimes it exciteth alſo a certain ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but however, it alwaies dyeth the Skin of a Red and livid or leaden colour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ecchymoſis</note>But the Affect is various and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and the <hi>Ecchymoſis</hi> ariſeth in a different manner, ſince that the blood is not evermore poured forth without the Veins; but oftentimes by reaſon of the great abundance of the Spirits and Blood the Veins and Arteries that are terminated in the Skin are filled full of blood, and thereupon the Body becometh colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; as appeareth out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Epid. 2.

                  <p>And to tel you the truth, in what place ſoever there is ſuch an effuſion of Blood, it may in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral be called <hi>Ecchymoſis:</hi> yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his fourth Book, Chap. 30 (according to the diverſity of the parts affected) reckoneth up three kinds or ſpecies, all which may be called by their ſeveral diſtinct and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar names. The firſt is thoſe which we call <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popia</hi> (and by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> named <hi>Hypophthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>) that is, <hi>Subocularia,</hi> to wit, paleneſſes, or wanneſſes under the Eyes. Now it is termed <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popion</hi> from <hi>Ops,</hi> that is, the Eye, becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth under the Eyes; and it is an Affect diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from that we call <hi>Hypopyon</hi> (the difference lying in this, that the former is written by ω and ι, the latter by ο and υ,) from <hi>Pus</hi> (which the Greeks call <hi>Pyon</hi>) becauſe it is a collection of <hi>Pus</hi> or purulent matter under the <hi>Cornea</hi> Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. The ſecond Species is <hi>Hypoſphagma,</hi> which ſome in ſpecial term <hi>Suggillatio,</hi> to wit, an effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood into the <hi>Adnata</hi> or <hi>Cornea</hi> (both of them Tunicles) of the Eye; touching which we have already ſpoken in the firſt Book of our Practice, Part 1. Sect. 2. Chap. 32. The third Species is that which is cauſed by the Contuſion or bruiſing of the Nails; this Species <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> calleth <hi>Hyponychos,</hi> and the Latine Authors term it <hi>Subungulus,</hi> in regard that it is an Affect under the Nails.</p>

By reaſon of this his ſo ſudden and unexpected death the Phyſitians were que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd and called to an account, for that they had not rightly and as was fitting managed the Cure.

                     <p>But in very truth, when from a fal from ſome high place, beating and bruiſing (and the like Cauſes) the blood is not only gotten together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Skin and the external parts, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo is poured forth into the more inward parts, after the ſame manner as it is in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Body when the Veſſels are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or broken (which ſaid blood is there clotted and corrupted, and is wont to cauſe Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the worſt ſort of Feavers, dangerous Symptoms, and very frequently death it ſelf) we muſt therefore uſe the beſt of our endeavor that the clotting and growing together of the aforeſaid blood may be hindered, that it may be diſſolved, and that it may be evacuated by ſtool, urine, or ſweats, and that with al due and poſſible ſpeed. For when once the blood hath gotten a putridneſs the Malady is not ſo eaſily cured, nor indeed at al without the moſt exquiſite and ſingular extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Remedies. Wherefore ſo ſoon as there is any the leaſt ſuſpition that the blood is fallen forth without the Veins into the more inward parts, and that it cannot be diſſipated by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Remedies, we muſt then uſe theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: to wit, <hi>Rheubarb, Rhapontick, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſigillat. Sperma Ceti</hi> (in the Shops termed Patmaſitty) <hi>the Eyes of Crabs, Mummy, red Corals, Harts-born, Madder</hi> (ſuch as the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers uſe in coloring) <hi>with the Waters of Chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foyl, Carduus, Marjoram, St. Johns wort, Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory, Alkekengy, Card. benedict. Scabious, the Syrup of Sorrel, Syrup de Acetoſitat.

                     <p>Take <hi>Rheubarb, Terra ſigilat. Bole arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, Mummy, of each one dram; make of theſe a Pouder:</hi> of which give one dram at once, with the Water of Cherefoyl, or Shepherds-Pouch. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Terra ſigillat. Crabs Eyes, of each one ſcruple; Sperma Ceti, Goats blood prepared, Angelica and Gentian Roots, choyce Rheubarb, of each half a ſcruple; ſeeds of Carduus Bened. ſeven grains; Cloves three grains:</hi> Make of theſe a Ponder for two Doles, to be taken at twice, and drunk with the following Waters:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Water of the Infuſion of Lavender one ounce; the Waters of Cherefoyl, St. Johns wort, Strawberries, of each one ounce and half; Wine Vinegar half an ounce, for twice.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Terra ſigillat. Madder, Mummy, great Comfrey, Rheubarb, of each a ſcruple: mingle them, and make a Pouder.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Rheubarb, the Root of Madder, Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Crabs Eyes, the ſeed of Carduus Mariae, or Mary Thiſtle, the Root of round Ariſtolochia or Birthwort, of each one dram: mingle and make
<pb n="2465" facs="tcp:49110:36"/> a Pouder:</hi> give hereof a dram at once, with the Syrup of Sorrel.</p>
                     <p>Some there be likewiſe that commend the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Nuts.</p>
                     <p>They commonly adminiſter one dram of <hi>Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Ceti</hi> diſſolved in Vinegar, or ſome fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Water.</p>
                     <p>There are likewiſe ſome that make uſe of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, and that with good ſucceſs alſo; which are likewiſe taken into the Body, and are therefore ſtiled Potable; as for inſtance, the Potable red Unguent of the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Practitioners. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Green Sanicle four ounces; the Leaves of Betony, Fennel ſeed, Juniper Berries unripe, of each three ounces; the Root of Elecampane, of the greater Comſrey, Rue, Ground Ivy, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Rhapontick root, of each two ounces: all theſe being ſhred very ſmal, let them be ſtirred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and incorporated with three pound of freſh Butter: Set them then in the Sun for eight daies: afterward put thereinto one Cyath or little Cup ful (about two ounces) of Sanide Water; then boyl it til the water and juyces be quite conſumed; and then let the Butter thus incorporated and moiſtened with the Juyces be preſſed forth, and kept for uſe.</hi> The Doſe is half an ounce twice a day, to be taken with warm Beer; the place affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted may likewiſe be outwardly anointed with the ſame, yet not at the firſt beginning and appearance of the diſtemper, but ſome while after. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take theſe Herbs, <hi>Wormwood, Southern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, of each two handfuls: the Herb Ladies Mantle, Motherwort or Mugwort, the leſſer Comfrey, the leſſer Sage, Germander, the leſſer Centaury, Croſswort, Fennel, Strawberries, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugreek, Ground Ivy or Aleboof, Hyſſop, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, Milfoyl, Marjoram, Balm, Bugle, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyroyal, Pyrole or Winter green, Pimpernel, Roſemary, Sage, Sanicle, Savory, Spicknard, Betony, Vervain, of each one handful; the roots of Marſh-mallows, Clove-gilliflowers, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conſound, Angelica, Pimpernel, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil, of each of theſe one ounce.</hi> Theſe Herbs and Roots gathered green in the month of <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June,</hi> boyl in ſix pound of <hi>May Butter;</hi> adding thereto as much <hi>Wine</hi> as you judg ſufficient: let them boyl together, until they be boyled enough, ſtil taking heed that they burn not to; and in the end adding of the Oyl of Bayes freſh and new, four ounces; <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> half a pound; Make here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with an Unguent of a green color: the Doſe is one ounce, in Vinegar or Beer; and this may likewiſe be outwardly applied unto Wounds. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Roots of Tormentil, Dittany, Sani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, the greater Conſound, Conſound Sarracen, of each two ounces; Caſtoreum one ounce</hi> (that ſort of it that is offenſive by reaſon of its unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing taſt may be omitted) <hi>Madder three ounces; May Butter three pound; red Wine as much as will ſuffice: mingle and boyl them till the Wine be conſumed; herewith make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto of Sperma Ceti one ounce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Topicks, at the firſt beginning ſome Aſtringents are to be mingled with the diſcuſſive Medicaments. For when the Tunicles of the Veins (out of which the blood is poured forth) are ſomwhat bruiſed, they ought then to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtrained together, bound faſt, and condenſed, leſt that the new matter drawn thither by pain be poured forth; ſince that if in the beginning only Digeſtives be adminiſtred, they wil not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs the blood poured forth of the Veins, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and draw unto the part that blood that is in the bruiſed ſmal Veins. Afterward, that the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle contuſed or bruiſed Veins may return unto their Natural ſtate, Digeſtives alone are to be made uſe of. For this end and purpoſe, ſome there be (now this indeed is the beſt kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy eſpecially for thoſe that are beaten) that wrap about the ſick perſon the Skin of a Ram new flaid off, and whilſt it is yet hot, beſprinkled with Salt, Myrtle Berries, and the Pouder of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Creſſes; or if ſuch a skin may not convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be gotten, they anoint the Patient with the Oyl of Roſes, of Myrtles, and of Earthworms, with which they mingle the Pouder of red Roſes, or Myrtle Berries; and the day following ſuch a like Liniment may be adminiſtred;</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent Dialthaea three ounces; Oyl of Earthworms, Camomil, and Dill, of each one ounce; Turpentine two ounces; the meal of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugreek, the pouder of red Roſes, and Myrtles, of each half an ounce; Saffron one ſcruple: make a Liniment, or an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent with a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Wax.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If there be any particular Contuſion, ſuch a like Liniment may at the firſt be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred;</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Roſes, of Myrtles, of Camomil, of each one ounce; the white of one Egg; the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Myrtles and Roſes, of each two drams: mingle, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, on the third day, let the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted be fomented with the Decoction of Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, Wormwood, and Cummin.</p>
                     <p>The next following Liniment may likewiſe be adminiſtred. But now in the curing of the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillation the moſt efficacious Remedy is the Root of the Herb <hi>Sigillum Solomonis,</hi> or Solomons Seal; which either new gathered, or elſe in the Winter ſeaſon macerated in Wine, and bruiſed, and then applied in the form of a Cataplaſm of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in one only night wholly taketh away the Suggillation, ſo that the Native heat returneth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the part affected. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Roots of both the Conſounds, of each three ounces; Camomil and Melilot flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of each two ſmal handfuls; the meal of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Fenugreek, and Beans, of each one ounce; the pouder of Wormwood, half an ounce; Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min ſeed one dram; Saffron half a ſcruple:
<pb n="2466" facs="tcp:49110:37"/> Mingle them, and make a Decoction for a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is likewiſe commended a muſty or moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Nut bruiſed, Reddiſh Seed, with dried Figgs; Muſtard Seed with Vinegar, Rue with Honey. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Root of Wake-Robin or Cuckowpint while it is green, an ounce and half; Solomons Seal four ounces; theſe Roots being ſhred ſmal, pour upon them the water of Elder flowers, white Lillies, and Bean flowers, of each four ounces, Wine Vinegar two ounces, Alom ſix drams, one Gall of a Bull; let them ſtand and digeſt for the ſpace of eight daies, and every day during that time let them be well ſhaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Water let Linen Cloaths be well ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and ſo applied unto the part affected. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pigeons Blood, Cummin, Camomile, of each one dram; the meal of Fenugreek, half a dram; Celtick Spikenard one ſcruple, Malmſey as much as is ſufficient; make a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſpecial, in a Swelling (eſpecially if there be a Leaden and wan colour after Veneſection) there may be fitly applied the Oyl of Rue, and the Leaves of common Rue, boyled in common Oyl impoſed upon the place affected.</p>
                     <p>But if the Malady be not remedied by theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, neither the blood that is ſhed forth without the Veſſels may by them be diſperſed, then if the place wil bear it, Cupping-glaſſes are to be adminiſtred; which are the moſt effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the extracting of whatſoever is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a deep place; and moreover if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Scarifications are alſo to be made uſe of, that ſome of the Blood may manifeſtly be evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and emptied forth.</p>
                     <p>But now if by all theſe there cannot be made that Reſolution of the Blood that ought to be, and withal if there be preſent any tokens and ſigns of a ſuppuration, as for example, if the place ſwel up a little and appear ſoft to the touch; if there be a certain bearing pain, and a redneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to appear round about, then the ſuppuration (in the common and received Opinion and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chirurgeons) is to be holpen on and by all means to be furthered. The Suppuration being thus finiſhed and wrought, the Ulcer is then to be purged and cleanſed, filled up with Fleſh, and at length cloſed up with a Cicatrice. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the uſe of theſe ſuppuratives great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be had; and of theſe only ſuch as are gentle, mild, and moderate, are to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. For if there be any error committed in the uſe of theſe, and that we be not extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefull in this point, there may eaſily be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the part a ſordid and filthy Ulcer, and a putridneſs withal. When therfore ſome of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chirurgeons &amp; thoſe of our time wel conſider the Premiſes, and what we have ſaid, they adviſe, that when we perceive that the Contuſion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and turn'd into an Impoſtume, a perfect ſuppuration is not then to be expected. For if the <hi>Pus</hi> or purulent matter that is generated from the congealed and clotted blood be any long time detained and kept in the place affected, it may then excite and cauſe many evils, as Feavers, pains, and an extraordinary putridneſs; and may likewiſe corrupt the neer neighboring parts, the Nerves, and the Bones; whereupon afterward Ulcers of dangerous conſequence, and Fiſtulaes alſo even from hence oftentimes take their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Neither likewiſe do theſe admit of any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollient and ſuppurating Emplaſters and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms; in regard that by theſe a putridneſs, and thoſe other evils and miſchiefs that are wont from thence to ariſe, may eaſily be excited in the part. But they counſel and adviſe us rather that ſuch a place wherein there is contained any clotted blood (which now exciteth the Apoſtem) be forthwith opened with a Pen-knife; and that in the Wound made by Inciſion there be conveyed in a Tent anointed with Unguent Aegyptiack; and that the whol place be wel ſenced and covered with ſome fit and convenient Emplaſter that may preſerve the Native heat thereof, and defend it from putridneſs. And this they conceive is more eſpecially to be obſerved, if the contuſion be made in the Sides, the Belly, or the Back. For then there is diligent heed to be taken, whether or no on the third, fourth, or fifth day (in that place wherein the Contuſion or bruiſing happened) there ariſe any Swelling with a pain, and thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth from day to day encreaſe; and whether or no there be a beating pain excited; and that the ſick Perſon cannot wel endure that the ſaid place be touched; and whether there be another kind of redneſs appearing in the Circumference; and whether the breathing be difficult; and ſome kind of preternatural heat diſcovering it ſelf in the Body. For wherever theſe things appear, (albeit there be appearing no wanneſs or Leaden colour in the external parts) it is a ſign and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that the <hi>Pus</hi> or corrupt filth is gotten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that the Impoſtume is excited. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (leſt that the <hi>Pus</hi> convert it ſelf unto the more inward parts, and there raiſe as it were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-burrows (for ſo they term them) and gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſunder eat through the more inward parts, and ſo by this means haſten upon the ſick Party a ſudden Death, or long continuing Diſeaſes, the the place is ſpeedily to be opened; for the place being thus opened, the <hi>Pus</hi> very eaſily iſſueth forth. Let the Wound be afterward handled and ordered as we ſaid before; and herein we muſt not neglect or omit Veneſection, and Vulnerary Potions; but they conceive that there is ſcarcely any, or at leaſt very little benefit ariſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewing to the Patient from Emollients and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puratives.</p>
                     <pb n="2467" facs="tcp:49110:37"/>
                     <p>But if the Contuſion be great, or that any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror hath been committed in the Cure, or that the place begin to look black ahd blewiſh, and to be mortified (by reaſon of the ſuffocation of the Native heat, ſo that a Gangrene and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be feared, as like to enſue) then in the firſt place Scarification is to be adminiſtred; or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if need ſo require, Cupping-glaſſes are to be applied, that ſo the corrupt blood may be evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. After this the part is to be fomented with warm Vinegar, or the Decoction made of the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Root, of <hi>Serpentaria</hi> or Vipers Graſs, Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kowpint, Solomons Seal, and Wine as much as wil ſuffice. For ſuch like Remedies diſſolve the clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted blood, and draw it forth from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom unto the outmoſt part of the Skin. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter let there be applied the Diachylon-Flower-de-luce Emplaſter. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Southernwood, Cumin Seed, Camomilo Flowers, of each one dram; the Juyce of Wake-robbin or Cuckowpint as much as will ſuffice; make hereof a Cataplaſm.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oylan ounce and half, Wax an ounce, the Juyce of Marjoram an ounce and half; let them diſſolve together at the Fire, and then add of the Spirit of Wine one ounce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to conclude, that which <hi>Paraeus</hi> adviſeth is to be taken notice of; to wit, that in the contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Muſcles (and eſpecially thoſe about the Ribs) the Fleſh a little ſwelleth up, and beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as it were ſnotty and purulent; inſomuch that if it be preſſed down and ſqueezed together is ſendeth forth a flatulent Air, with a certain kind of low noyſe and gentle hiſſing, and withall the print and impreſſion of the Fingers remaineth, and is to be ſeen for ſome while after. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (in that void ſpace that the Fleſh ſeparating it ſelf from the Bones hath leſt) there is a purulent and rotten filth gathered together, by which there is cauſed a ſyderation and putrefaction. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſhal happen, the Malady is ſpeedily to be taken in hand, the beſt means uſed, and the part moſt ſtrictly and cloſely to be drawn together; and furthermore, <hi>Oxycroceum</hi> or <hi>Ireat Diachy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> or the like Digeſtives are to be adminiſtred.</p>
                     <p>And thus much ſhall ſuffice to have been ſpoken touching Tumors ariſing from the Blood; there now follow thoſe Tumors that ariſe and proceed from Choler.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But now <hi>Herpes</hi> is truly and properly a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor proceeding and taking its original from Choler. And it is termed <hi>Herpes</hi> from its cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; to wit, becauſe it ſeemeth to creep like unto a Snake; and for this reaſon, becauſe that no ſooner doth one part ſeem to be healed and wel, but the Diſeaſe inſtantly creepeth unto the next adjoyning parts. And although (to ſpeak truly) there are very many Maladies that Creep along; yet in ſpecial, that Tumor is by Phyſitians termed <hi>Herpes</hi> that is excited in the ſuperficies of any part (from yellow choler ſincere or ſimple, that is, ſevered from all other humors) and from thence creepeth along unto the parts next adjoyning. For as the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ariſeth from blood very than and choletick; ſo the <hi>Herpes</hi> proceedeth from excrementitious Choler. <hi>Celſus</hi> ſeemeth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and mention <hi>Herpes</hi> under the name and notion of <hi>Ignis Sacer,</hi> or the Sacred Fire: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other Latine Phyſitians underſtand an <hi>Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas</hi> under this appellation of <hi>Ignis Sacer.</hi>

                     <p>The Differences of <hi>Herpes</hi> are taken from the diverſity of the conteining Cauſe, and the humor: For although every <hi>Herpes</hi> hath its original from Choler and a thin humor; yet notwithſtanding, ſince there are certain degrees of its tenuity, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and purity; if that humor, or choler, be ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and of a thin ſubſtance, then the Affect that reteineth the general name is termed a ſimple or ſingle <hi>Herpes.</hi> But then if there be any portion of Flegm mingled therewith, there is produced an <hi>Herpes</hi> that cauſeth and raiſeth little Bladders in the Skin like unto the Millet, whereupon it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Herpes Miliaris.</hi> And laſtly, if the Choler

                     <p>That ſo therfore the <hi>Herpes</hi> may be cured, there ought to be a due regard had unto the Cauſe Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and Continent, as alſo unto the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and in the firſt place, and eſpecially of the Antecedent. Since therefore that <hi>Herpes</hi> hath its original from yellow Choler and a ſalt humor, the ſaid yellow Choler is firſt eſpecially to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the Body; for unleſs the Body be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the ſick Perſon wil never perfectly be cured and made ſound. For although upon the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Topical Medicaments, in ſome one place the part may ſeem to be found and wel; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it ſoon breaketh forth again in another. If the matter be extraordinary thin (as it is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in <hi>Herpes</hi>) then Sudoriſicks ought likewiſe to have their due and proper place. But if there be any thing of Phlegm, or of the ſerous wheyiſh humor therewithall mingled, then ſome of thoſe Medicaments that purge Flegm and Whey may therewith be mingled. The Diet likewiſe that is preſcribed ought to be ſuch as is fit and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent where Choler and the aduſt humor offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
                     <p>Now when we have in the firſt place done what is requiſite as to the Antecedent Cauſe, we are in the next place to take into conſideration that very Cauſe that we call conteining. And therefore firſt of all, when there is in the Skin an extream and intenſe heat of Choler, then Coolers are to be adminiſtred, that may both extinguiſh the fervent heat of the Choler, and likewiſe repell and drive back moderately; ſuch as are thoſe Refrigerating Medicaments that are commonly wont to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in the <hi>Eryſipelas;</hi> as for inſtance, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
<pb n="2469" facs="tcp:49110:38"/> Knotgraſs, and Navel-wort (which laſt ſome cal <hi>Venus</hi>-Navel, or Kidney-wort) and the like. After that the fervency of the heat is ſomwhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and qualified, that which remaineth behind is to be digeſted and diſſipated by Medicaments that are rather of a drying Nature than ſuch as moiſten: as for example, Linſeed boyled in Wine and Oyl, and the ſpume or froth of Silver. And theſe are more convenient in a ſimple heat. But now if Puſtules ſhal chance to happen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that they are ſomtimes broken and putrefie, (leſt that there be excited in the part a putridneſs) thoſe Refrigerating and Repelling Medicaments ought not to be cold and wateriſh, but cold and dry. And therefore in the firſt place, we are to make uſe of the yong Shoots of the Vines, the tops of the Black-berry buſh (or as ſome cal it the Dog-berry tree) the Leaves of the Sallow tree, and Plantane. Here is likewiſe uſeful the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm that is made of the Rinds of the Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and Barley meal boyled in Wine. There may alſo be adminiſtred, Galls, Cypreſs Nuts, Pomegranate flowers, Bole-armenick, and Terra Sigillata. And when at length there is need of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtives, there may be Cataplaſms compounded of the Meal of Millet, Beans, Flax, and Lupines, boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Wine. If the Puſtules break, and the <hi>Pus</hi> flow forth, there are likewiſe Cleanſers to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred. For this end and purpoſe, this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is fit and proper:</p>

                     <p>Take <hi>Barley meal, Bean meal, the meal of Lentils, of each one ounce and half; the pouder of red Roſes, Wormwood, the prickly Dock, of each half an ounce: boyl them in the Decoction of Pomegranate rinds, Pomegranate flowers, Plantane: add hereto afterward the Oyl of Myrtle, and Honey, of each a ſufficient quentity, and make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Unto which (if uſe and need require it) we may alſo add and mingle the flower of Braſs, and ſuch like. And the very ſame likewiſe are convenient in the <hi>Herpes Eſthiomenos;</hi> as for inſtance:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Sumach, Plantane, Galls, of each an ounce and half; of branny Bread one ounce; Pouder of Roſes half an ounce: boyl them all in Wine, and make a Cataplaſm.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>cleanſed Barley, Lentiles, Beans, of each one handful; Arnogloſs (or Lambs Tongue) two handſuls; Pomegranate flowers, Roſes, the grains of Myrtle, Sumach, of each half an ounce.

                     <p>This is likewiſe commended:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But if the Ulcer be already putreſied, we muſt then betake our ſelves to the Remedies that are ſtronger and more forcible; ſuch as are the little ſweet Bals of <hi>Andro, Muſa,</hi> and <hi>Polyidas:</hi> a for example;</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Litharge, and Ceruſs, of each two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the Rinds of Pomegranates half an ounce; Myrrh one dram; Frankincenſe a dram and half; the flower of Braſs and Allum, of each a dram; and with the Oyl of Myrtle and Waie (a ſufficient quantity of each) make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if theſe wil not ſerve the turn, and that the Ulcer and putrefaction creep further, and become broader, we muſt then have recourſe unto the ſtronger ſort of Remedies.</p>
                     <p>They refer likewiſe unto choletick Tumors thoſe that we cal <hi>Phlyctaenae, Impetigines, Liche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Sudamina,</hi> and <hi>Epinyctides.</hi> But becauſe that theſe little riſings or ſwellings proceed not from pure Choler, but from Choler mingled with ſerous and ſalt Humors, we wil therefore

                  <p>LIke as thoſe Tumors that we have already hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto handled, have their original from hot Humours; ſo there are likewiſe ſome certain pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Tumors that ariſe from cold Humors; and in the firſt place, <hi>Oedema,</hi> that hath its original from Flegm. For although <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and other ancient Phyſitians under the name of <hi>Oedema</hi> underſtand al other Tumors whatſoever in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; yet notwithſtanding thoſe of latter times by <hi>Oedema</hi> do underſtand ſome one certain kind of Tumor only, and this they ſpecially term <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dema;</hi> being a Tumor that is lax or looſe, ſoft, without pain, yielding unto the touch and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the ſingers, having its original from thin flegm, or elſe from the more cold and moiſt part of the Maſs of blood.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>The containing Cauſe of this Tumor is that flegm that is contained in the blood, to wit, if it be ſo increaſed, that it irritate and ſtir up the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive Faculty. For then Nature being ſtirred up and provoked thruſteth forth the matter out of the greater Veſſels unto the leſs, and expelleth it from the more noble parts unto the weaker, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at length it be received and retained by the moſt weak and infirm part. The cold and heavy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor it ſelf likewiſe very often by its own weight tendeth downwards, and alſo unto the extream parts. And thereupon it it, that although the <hi>Oedema</hi> may be excited in al parts whatſoever of the body; yet notwithſtanding it chiefly and more eſpecially ariſeth in the Hands, and the feet, (as it evidently appeareth in Perſons that are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical, Cachectical, and Phthiſical) in regard that thoſe parts are more remote from the fountain of heat. But now this <hi>Oedema</hi> is not ſuddenly generated, but by degrees, and by little and little. For why? the Humor is thick, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unfit for any ſpeedy and ſudden moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen,</hi> in his ſecond Book to <hi>Glauco,</hi> and third Chapter, determineth that the <hi>Oedema</hi> is cauſed by a Pituitous or flegmy ſubſtance, or elſe by the Spirits when they are ful of vapors; and ſuch a like Tumor or ſwelling happeneth in dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes. From which place (as likewiſe from the 14. of his Method of Phyſick, Chap. 4) <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Philippus Ingraſſias,</hi> in his Book of Tumors, the firſt Tome, page 113. endeavoreth to prove a twofold kind of <hi>Oedema;</hi> the one from thin flegm; the other from a vaporous ſpirit: and that (to wit, the former) he aſſerteth to be a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and the latter a Symptom only that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth upon Phthiſis, and the water betwixt the Skin, (one ſpecies of the Dropſie) and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexy. But yet although it be not to be denied that Carkaſſes (in the very firſt beginning of there putrefying, and as it were a certain kind of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation) ſwel up in ſome ſort; yet that in the Cachexy, or Phthiſis, the <hi>Oedematoſe</hi> ſwellings of the Feet ſhould in this ſame manner be cauſed, I cannot eaſily beleeve; in regard that ſuch a like putridneſs doth not then happen; but it is far more credible, that ſuch like Tumors are cauſed from a ſerous wheyiſh Humor abounding in the body, and deſcending unto the Feet, and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding and ſticking faſt, as in a part more cold than the other parts of the Body. And be it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed granted and admitted, that in the ſimilar parts there may be ſome kind of ſlatulent Spirit collected, and that it may lift up the part into a Tumor; yet notwithſtanding this Tumor is not properly <hi>Oedema,</hi> but is rather to be termed <hi>Empneumatoſis,</hi> or <hi>Emphyſema.</hi> And albeit ſuch a like Tumor is by <hi>Galen,</hi> in his 14. Book of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 4. called a Symptom; yet we ſay, that <hi>Galen</hi> then uſeth the name of a Symptom (in the general) for every Affect preternatural that followeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>But if we wel weigh and conſider what this Tumor properly is, we affirm that it is altogether and in al reſpects a Diſeaſe; in regard that it is magnitude augmented, and for the moſt part an impediment and hindrance unto men in their walking. And although ſuch an <hi>Oedema</hi> doth not indeed requite a peculiar Cure; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is not for al that to be razed out of the number of Diſeaſes, and placed among the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. For thoſe Diſeaſes that ſimply depend upon other Diſeaſes require not any proper and peculiar kind of Cure; but thoſe being removed, theſe likewiſe are taken away.</p>
                     <p>But now that very Humor that is the cauſe of <hi>Oedema</hi> is generated by an error and default in the ſangnification; touching which we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the third Book of our Practice, third Part, ſecond Section, and firſt Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>Oedema</hi> is known in this manner: The Tumor is ſoft, and looſe; and if it be preſſed down with the ſinger, it eaſily yieldeth and giveth way by ſinking, and ſo there is a little pit and print of the ſinger left behind.

For the flegm looſeneth the part; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it by diſſolving unity excite any pain.

But if the <hi>Oedema</hi> ariſe without any other Diſeaſe, then in the firſt place, the cauſe from which the matter is ſupplied is to be removed and taken away. And therefore in the very firſt beginning, the courſe of Diet that is to be ordained muſt be ſuch that in the leaſt tendeth not to the generating and bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of flegm, but rather ſuch as waſteth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth it. And therefore let the Air in which the ſick perſon abideth be dry; and likewiſe, let the meat and drink that he lives upon have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and quality of attenuating and drying. Let the ſick party therefore be very ſparing and temperate in meat and drink, that ſo the Natural heat be not oppreſſed and overwhelmed, and ſo by the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening of it Grudities be generated; but that the ſaid heat may rather waſt and conſume thoſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and the more fitly and effectually work upon them. Let his Bread be wel baked, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened: and let him altogether abſtain from bread unleavened; and let him but ſeldom eat either Pot-herbs or Broths. Fiſh is altogether unfit for him, unleſs it be freſh River fiſh, and of them ſuch as are of a more ſolid ſubſtance, and theſe likewiſe (even as al other his food) are to be ſeaſoned and ſauced with Spices and drying herbs. Al endeavor muſt be uſed that the Belly may day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharge its office; which if of it ſelf it cannot do, it wil then be requiſite that before his meals he take ſome Aloes, which looſeneth the Belly, and conſumeth and drieth up the ſuperabundant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity. Before meals (if it may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any offence and prejudice unto the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) let the ſick perſon exerciſe himſelf, that ſo the ſuperfluous moiſture may be conſumed, and the Native heat excited and ſtirred up: and to conclude, let him ſleep only in the night, and let his ſleep then likewiſe be but ſhort.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In an <hi>Oedema</hi> properly ſo called Veneſection hath no place at al; for here the blood is no waies peccant, but only the flegm: but the cold and crude humors in the body are to be concocted and evacuated. And firſt of al, the matter is to be digeſted concocted by Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that heat and dry, ſuch as are elſewhere of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten propounded in the preparation of the flegmy humor; of which a certain Hydromel or Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel may moſt fitly be compounded. But yet notwithſtanding if the humor be only wheyiſh, there is then no need at al of concoction.</p>
                     <p>Afterward the matter is to be evacuated by Medicaments that draw forth the flegm, which are elſewhere propounded. As for what concerns the part it ſelf that is affected, the pituitous or flegmy humour which hath flown together into it ought to be evacuated; and this may be done by Repellers and Digeſtives, or thoſe things that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs and ſcatter. But if Repellers be made uſe of, they are to be adminiſtred, not ſo much to drive back the humor, as to confirm and ſtrengthen the part, and to dry up and conſume the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ter; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which likewiſe there may not unfitly be added ſome of thoſe Remedies that have in them a power and virtue to diſcuſs. To this end and purpoſe, <hi>Galen</hi> maketh uſe of a new Spunge (or if a new one may not be had, than any other) throughly wet and ſoaked in Nitre and Ley, and Poſca, that is, a mixture of Vinegar and Water. There may likewiſe be uſed the courſer part of Hemp (which we cal Hurds) inſtead of the Spunge. Which ſaid Medicament if it accompliſh not our deſire, the quantity of the Vinegar may then be augmented,
<pb n="2472" facs="tcp:49110:40"/> and a little Alum therewith mingled. And if neither this effect our purpoſe, nor ſatisfie our expectation, we ought then to betake our ſelves unto thoſe that are ſtronger and more forcible. As,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Flowers of red Roſes, Camomile, the Leaves of Myrtle, and of Wormwood, of each half an handful, Pomegranate Flowers, and the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Nut, of each one handful; Alum, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt, of each one ounce and half; boyl them in Vinegar and Water, or in Ley, and ſo apply it with a Spunge, a Linen Cloth, or Hurds. Or elſe,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the Leaves of the Sallow Tree, Myrtle, Wormwood, the Flowers of Camomile, and of St. Johns-wort, of each half a handful: let them be all boyled in Ley until all the Ley be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; afterward, let them be wel pounded and bruiſed, and then add the Oyl of Myrtle, of Roſes, and of Wormwood, of each one ounce; Salt half a handful, Nitre one ounce; make a Cataplaſm. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Cypreſs Nuts, Pomegranate Flowers, of each half a handfull; Flowers of Camomile and red Roſes, and the Leaves of Wormwood, of each half a handful, the meal of Barley and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, of each half an ounce. Alum three drams; Aloes and Myrtle, of each one dram; Saffron one ſcruple; boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of Water and Vinegar; and make a Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>Afterward in the ſtate we are to proceed unto thoſe things that diſcuſs and dry much. For this purpoſe there is commended the Water of Lime, or a Ley of the Vine aſhes applied with a Spunge; Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Marſhmallow Roots, one handful, the Flowers of Camomile and Melilote, of each half a handfull; boyl them in Wine and Vinegar, adding afterwards of Hoggs Fat two ounces, old Oyl half an ounce, the Spume or Froth of Silver one ounce; Mingle them, and make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</p>
                     <p>That Medicament is alſo very efficacious that is made of Rue, Honey, and Salt. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Sulphur one ounce, Pigeons Dung ten drams, Bean meal one ounce and half, the meal of Lupines one ounce, Honey one ounce and half; and ſo make a Cataplaſm with the Decoction of Camomile flowers. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Sulphur, Myrrh, Salt, of each one ounce, old Oyl and Vinegar, of each as much as will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and make a Liniment. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Bryony roots two ounces, Wormwood, Bearfoots, Camomile, Melilote, of each half a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; boyl them in Water of Honey, and being wel bruiſed &amp; ſearced, add to them the powder of red Roſes, the Meal of Beans and Lupines, of each half an ounce; old Oyl as much as will ſuffice, and make a Cataplaſm. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the Root of Aſphodil, and the wild Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber, white Lilly roots, and Flowers of Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, of each one handful; boyl them untill they be ſoft, and then add of Leaven, Tartar, waſhed or ſlaked Lime, and Sulphur, of each an ounce, Frankincenſe ſix drams, the Fat of a Hart, the Marrow of the Thigh-bones of Oxen, of each ten drams; make a Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>There is likewiſe commended Ox dung, or Cow dung; for it both mollifieth and reſolveth; of which with Sulphur, Frankincenſe, Honey, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and the Broth of a Cabbage or Colwort, there may be made a Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>In the applying of all which Medicaments, it is requiſite that we obſerve, that before ever the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſters, or Unguents, and Liniments, be applied, the part be firſt made hot by frictions or rubbings and fomentations; for otherwiſe the Medic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will not eaſily effect and accompliſh our deſire and expectation, by reaſon of the coldneſs of the part. The frictions may be made with hot Linen Cloaths; the fomentations may be of the Decoction of Camomile flowers, and Melilote flowers, and of the Leaves of Betony, Sage, Roſemary, Lavender, Organy, Wormwood and the like. For by the ſaid fomentations and frictions the heat together with the blood is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led back unto the part; and the excrements and ſuperfluous humors are ſomwhat diſperſed and ſcattered.</p>
                     <p>But if it be ſo that the <hi>Oedema</hi> ſeem to wax hard, and to paſs into a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> then we are likewiſe together with the former, to make uſe of Emollients or mollifying Medicaments. And for this uſe and purpoſe there is to be applied Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, in which the <hi>Lapis Pyrites</hi> (we commonly call it the Fire-ſtone) or a piece of Mill-ſtone ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken red hot out of the Fire hath been quenched; and after this the part is to be anoynted with old Oyl in the which the Root of the Wild Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Marſhmallow Roots have been boyled. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the Mucilage of Marſhmallow roots, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, Fenugreek, Gooſe fat, the Marrow of a Leg of Veal, the Flower-de-luce root, Camomile flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, of each two ounces; Styrax liquid, Mirrh, Frankincenſe, and oyl of Camomile, of each one ounce; Wax as much as wil ſerve the turn; and ſo make an Emplaſter.</p>
                     <p>But touching theſe Remedies we ſhall ſpeak further, when we come to treat of a <hi>Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And although indeed it be true, that the <hi>Oede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> is moſt frequently diſcuſſed and diſperſed by Reſolution; yet ſomtimes notwithſtanding (as is apparent out of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book of Prognoſticks Text 27.) it cometh to a ſuppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but this is but ſeldom, to wit, if it be in a place ſomwhat hotter than ordinary, or elſe that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humor be therewith mingled, as it happeneth in the <hi>Oedema Phlegmonodes;</hi> and this if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen there is then perceived in the next adjoyning part both a pain, and a pulſation or beating. And therefore at ſuch a time the Suppuration is to be
<pb n="2473" facs="tcp:49110:40"/> furthered and haſtened on by thoſe Medicaments that we call Emplaſtick; ſuch as are <hi>Diachilon ſimplex,</hi> and other Remedies made of the Roots of Marſhmallows, the common Mallows, Linſeed, Fenugreek, with the Fat of a Hen, or ſuch like. As for example,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bearfoot, Marſhmallows, the Roots of white Lillies, of each one handful; boyl them, and when they are ſufficiently bruiſed, add to them the meal of Linſeed, and Fenugreek, of each two ounces; Hogs Greaſe, and Hens fat, of each three ounces; Saffron half a dram, and thereof make a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The matter being concocted and ſuppurated, we are not to expect a ſpontaneous or ſelf-effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Cure, in regard it wil be a long time ere it come to this. Wherefore let the place be opened either with the Inſtrument for that purpoſe, or elſe with a potential Cautery; and afterward let the Impoſtume be throughly cleanſed and purged with Turpentine, Frankincenſe, Honey, the Juyce of Wormwood, and Honey of Roſes: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, let the Cavity or hollowneſs be filled up with the Unguent <hi>Baſilicon,</hi> the Unguent <hi>Aureum,</hi> &amp; the Unguent of Betony, and ſuch like; and at length let there be a Cicatrice drawn over it.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>HAving treated of thoſe Tumors that ariſe from the Blood, Choler, and Flegm; and it now remaining that we handle thoſe Tumors that ariſe from Melancholly and black Choler; and it being ſo that a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> (to ſpeak the truth) ariſeth from both Melancholly and Flegm, the next thing therefore that we have to do, is to treat of the <hi>Scirrhus.</hi> Now then a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is a hard Tumor without any ſenſe or pain (or if there be any it is certainly but very little) ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from a thick humor that is Viſcid, Clammy, and Cold; ſuch as it the melancholly humor and flegm fixed and faſtened in the parts. For there are two humors, (to wit, Melancholly and Flegm) out of which either ſingly and ſeverally, or elſe mingled together, the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> ariſeth, as they commonly determine. Now here (in this place) by Melancholly we are to underſtand, not that black humor which ariſeth either from the Natural and aduſt Melancholly humor, or elſe from yellow Choler aduſt; but here we are to underſtand that Melancholly that is Natural, and properly called the Melancholly humor, to wit, the thick and more feculent or dreggy part of the Blood, or elſe likewiſe the Natural Melancholly Excrement, or elſe alſo (thirdly) a thick humor arſing from an hardned Inflammation; the which if any one ſhal pleaſe to term Preternatural, I wil not in that gainſay him. But by Flegm we are not to underſtand that Natural Flegm, or the Flegmatick humor (which is moiſt and thin, and from which the <hi>Oedema</hi> proceedeth) but a thick Flegm, extraordinary dry, Glutimus, Viſci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and Clammy. Of both theſe humors re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ed in the part over long (whenas the more ſubtile and thin parts thereof are vaniſhed and gone, and the more thick and groſs parts left behind) is the <hi>Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> generated. For although ſome humor that is thick may flow unto ſome certain part; yet notwithſtanding a humor ſo thick and glutinous that it inſtantly cauſeth and produceth a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> doth not eaſily flow unto any part whatſoever, but it by degrees and after ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh ſuch in the very place affected, whenas the thinner part of the humor being waſted and conſumed, the thicker and groſſer are left to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main behind. From whence it is, that (for the greateſt part) the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> followeth upon other Tumors (as for inſtance, Inflammations, <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's</hi> and <hi>Oedema's</hi>) when they are not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rightly cured, and that the thinner parts by means of heating Medicaments are either unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, or overmuch and exceſſively diſſipated; or elſe are by Repellers and Aſtringents repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo that the more thick and groſs parts only are left behind; which being further incraſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed and thickned, do cauſe and produce this Tumor, that (as we ſaid before) is hard, and without pain and ſenſe. From all which Premiſes it may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be collected, that this Tumor is not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all at once generated, but by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding <hi>Paraeus</hi> diſſenteth from this common and received Opinion; and aſſerteth that the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is cauſed, not from the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humors, but from an alimentary juyce (yet ſuch as is more thick than is fit and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the nouriſhing of the fleſh) when it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hardened; unto which notwithſtanding there is (ſaith he) another humor adjoyned: and this hardening proceedeth (as from divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes, ſo likewiſe) from an Inflammation; not that the blood that is not diſcuſſed or ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated is thus hardened, or condenſed by the over frequent and unſeaſonable application of cold things; but that the blood being diſcuſſed by the vehement heat of an Inflammation, the juyce and moiſture of that part that was inflamed is thickned and hardned.</p>
                  <p>But now a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate (as we may ſo term it) and Illegitimate. Which ſaid diſtinction (as <hi>Fallopius</hi> truly tels us) is not taken from the diverſity or the matter, and the conteining Cauſe, but from the divers and different accidents and proprieties of the matter. For before ſuch time as all the more ſubtile and thin parts are either diſſipated or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, there is as yet no abſolute <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do all things then want ſenſe, neither is there as yet any perfect hardneſs appearing. But if (al the thinner parts being waſted and conſumed) only the thicker ſhal remain behind, and theſe ſhal harden even almoſt unto the hardneſs of a Stone,
<pb n="2474" facs="tcp:49110:41"/> and that the part is void not only of al pain, but likewiſe even of al ſenſe; then the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is now already abſolute and perfect. But perhaps there can nothing be ſaid to the contrary, why we may not term the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> that is not as yet abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute impure likewiſe, and baſtard, or ſpurious. Or if this diſtaſte, and pleaſe not; the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> (we ſay) may furthermore be divided into that which is pure, and truly ſo called, and that that is impure and ſpurious or counterfeit: and that may be called pure which hath its Original from melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly alone, or from thick flegm; and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and ſpurious which hath another humor mingled together with it, from whence it is called <hi>Scirrhus Phlegmonodes,</hi> or <hi>Scirrhus Cancroſus.</hi> There be ſome certain Authors that give us alſo another difference of a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> from the parts wherein it reſideth. For although in very many parts it hath no peculiar appellation, but it only defined by adjoyning to it the name of the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is known from two ſigns eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to wit, the hardneſs, and the abſence or want of pain: unto which this may likewiſe be added, That when it is preſſed it wanteth ſenſe; and then we ſay, that the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is altogether abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and confirmed. And it is not to be wondred at, that the part thus affected ſhould have no ſenſe, or that there ſhould be ſo little, if any ſenſe at al, in a <hi>Scirrhus;</hi> for both the influx of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſpirits is hindered by the matter that is impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and faſt fixed; and alſo the very temper it ſelf of the Member is ſo changed that the part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh altogether ſtupid. Others there are that add other ſigns alſo; viz. a Color ſomwhat black and wan; which yet notwithſanding is only a ſign of that <hi>Scirrhus</hi> that ariſeth from the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Humor; and if the temper be very cold, by reaſon of a thick and cold Humor, it is then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perceived by the touch.</p>

There are ſome likewiſe that add this, that in a Legitimate <hi>Scirrhus</hi> there grow hairs upon the part.

                     <p n="4">4. But when they may be cured, it is to be done in a twofold manner: either by Reſolution and Diſcuſſion; or elſe by Maturation and Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it is ſeldom that they are ſuppurated, and then likewiſe not without danger: for when they are ſuppurated they eaſily degenerate and paſs into Cancers; eſpecially thoſe of them that proceed from a Melancholy Humor.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>As for what therefore concerneth the Cure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be a plain and abſolute Tumor or Swelling already appearing, and that in the Cure we ought eſpecially to have reſpect unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Cauſe; and that we are to do our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor that it may be removed by Topical Remedies; notwithſtanding the Antecedent cauſe is alſo not altogether to be neglected; and here we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the augmentation of the Malady by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of any new matter.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore (firſt of al) whatſoever it be that generateth thick blood is carefully to be avoided; and ſuch meats are to be choſen that are eaſily concocted, and ſuch as make a ſupply of good Nutriment; and ſuch as incline and tend to humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and moiſtneſs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Humors (whether flegmatick or melancholick) are (being firſt wel prepared) to be evacuated by convenient and fit Medicaments; touching which we have already elſewhere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                     <p>But thirdly, and principally, we ought to uſe our utmoſt endeavor, that the Containing Cauſe and the matter that maketh the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> be quite and clean taken away. But as for Repellers, here is no place for them. For ſince that the matter is both thick and cold, it wil not yield nor give place unto Repellers; but rather by the uſe of
<pb n="2475" facs="tcp:49110:41"/> them is the more incraſſated and thickened, and as it were impacted, and made to ſtick the faſter in the part. Neither likewiſe are thoſe Medicaments that greatly heat and dry fit and proper in this place; for by theſe the matter is only the more hardened. But thoſe Medicaments that are here moſt conveniently adminiſtred, are, thoſe that have a vertue and quality to mollifie that that is hardened, and ſuch as afterward diſcuſs and ſcatter the matter when it is ſoftened. Malactick or mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying Medicaments are therefore to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and applied, that are of a hot temperament, and yet notwithſtanding but meanly, and not greatly drying; but neither yet manifeſtly moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening: but ſuch as obtain as it were a certain middle nature between Moiſteners and Dryers, and ſuch as accompliſh (as it were) a reſolution and ſoftening of the hardened ſubſtance. And ſuch are, <hi>The Oyl of ſweet Almonds, the Oyl of Camomil, and white Lillies, Hens fat, Gooſe fat, Swines fat, the Marrow of Veal, and of a Hart, the Mucilage of Marſh-mallow Roots, Linſeed, and Fenugreek; and ſuch are likewiſe the Leaves and Roots themſelves, of Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Mallows, Linſeed, Fenugreek, the Root of white Lillies, Bears-foot, dried Figs that are ful and fat, Wax, &amp;c.</hi> And ſtronger than theſe, are, <hi>Bears fat, old Oyl, Bdellium, Styrax li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, liquid Pitch, fat Roſins, Ammoniacum, Galbanum.</hi> But we muſt carefully obſerve, when thoſe Medicaments that are more mild and moderate are to be made uſe of, and when the ſtronger ſort.</p>
                     <p>In a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> that is but newly begun we are to uſe thoſe Medicaments that are of the milder ſort: but in an old and inveterate <hi>Scirrhus</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hard, thoſe Remedies that are more ſtrong and prevalent are to be put in practice. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the very Body it ſelf, and likewiſe the part affected, are to be conſidered. For unto an hard body the ſtronger ſort of Medicaments are to be applied; but for the tender and more ſoft bodies the milder and gentler ſort of Remedies are moſt convenient. The part if it be harder and thicker (as if the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> be in a Tendon or Ligament) then we ought to adminiſter and make uſe of the ſtronger Medicaments. And in the general we are to obſerve this for a Rule, That we handle the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> with al manner of care and caution. For if we adminiſter thoſe Remedies that do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much and more than is fitting Reſolve, then (as we alſo already ſaid before) the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth into a ſtony hardneſs. But if we too much mollifie, there is then a fear the the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> may degenerate into a Cancer. Wherefore it is moſt ſafe in this caſe to follow the counſel and advice of the Ancients, that we uſe not alone any Medicament that hath in it a power either only to dry, or only to moiſten; but that we adminiſter ſuch Remedies as mollifie and diſcuſs; not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by turns, and one after the other; or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe that we mingle together Emollients or Mollifiers with Digeſtives. And for this uſe <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> commendeth the fomentation of Vinegar, wherein the fire-hot <hi>Pyrites</hi> ſtone hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in this manner; Let the part be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Decoction of Marſh-mallows, Mallows, Bears-foot, the ſeed of Fenugreek, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, and the like Emollients. Afterward, take the <hi>Pyrites</hi> or Fire-ſtone, or a piece of a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and having made it red hot caſt it into the Vinegar; or elſe let the Vinegar be caſt and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon that hot and glowing ſtone, and then let the vapor of the Vinegar ſteam up and be received into the Member affected. After this, let the Emollients be again adminiſtred; and let theſe Remedies be (as they ought) often repeated at many ſeveral time, and ſucceſſively. And in this manner the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> that is almoſt deſperate may be cured. But if it be over tedious to uſe theſe Medicaments (in the aforeſaid manner) at ſeveral times, and by turns, then let them be al mingled together. For by this means, at one and the ſame time, and together, the Tumor is mollified, and that that is mollified is diſcuſſed and diſſipated by exhaling and breathing forth. For which end and purpoſe, out of the Simples before mentioned there may be divers Medicaments compounded. As,</p>

                  <p>THe Cancer (by the Greeks called <hi>Carcinos,</hi> and <hi>Carcinoma,</hi> ſo termed becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth the Water-Crab or Creviſh) is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from an aduſt Humor, or black Choler. And yet notwithſtanding <hi>Celſus</hi> ſeemeth to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Carcinoma</hi> and <hi>Cancer.</hi> For in his fift Book, and 28. Chapter, he calleth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that we treat of in this Chapter only <hi>Carci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noma.</hi> But in the ſame Book, and 16. Chapt. he giveth the name and appellation of a Cancer (in general) unto certain creeping Ulcers; under which he likewiſe comprehended the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> that is exulcerated, the <hi>Gangrene</hi> alſo, and the <hi>Sphacelus.</hi> But yet notwithſtanding al other Phyſitian whatſoever uſe the words <hi>Carcino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi> and <hi>Cancers</hi> as <hi>Synonyma's,</hi> that is, as words ſignifying one and the ſame Diſeaſe. For a <hi>Cancer</hi> is a Preternatural Tumor ariſing from black Choler, round, of a wan color, or ſomwhat blackiſh, painful; and which (when the Veins every where round about are filled and ſtrut out) reſembleth the feet of the Crab, Creviſh, or Crawfiſh.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>The Cauſe of a Cancer is black Choler, in which either yellow Choler, or the Melancholy Humor hath degenerated, by reaſon of its being burnt. For the Melancholy Humor, while it yet continueth to be Natural, and is not yet burnt, doth never cauſe or produce a Cancer, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Species or kind of <hi>Scirrhus.</hi> But from the black Choler alone, if it be burnt, (which ſticketh faſt in the Veins, neither can it by reaſon of its thickneſs penetrate into thoſe ſtreight and narrow paſſages, as the Melancholy humor doth that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the <hi>Scirrhus</hi>) the Cancer is excited and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. But now of this black Choler there is a certain difference; for ſome of it is more mild and moderate, or leſs hot and ſharp; but then another ſort of it is very ſharp and hot. That which is more mild cauſeth a ſecret hidden <hi>Cancer</hi> that is not exulcerated; but that that is more hot and ſharp exciteth an exulcerated Cancer. Now the ſaid black Choler is more or leſs ſharp, according as it is more or leſs burnt, or ariſe from a humor that is more or leſs ſharp. Whereupon it is, That that which proceedeth from yellow Choler adult and burnt is worſe than that which hath its original from a Melancholy humor. And leek by how much the longer it abideth in the place affected, and by how much the more it is putrefied and burnt, by ſo much the more it is rendered the worſe. And hence it is that the Natural Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly humor alſo which firſt exciteth a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> if it ſtick and abide long in the part, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then when it is not handled with al care and caution in the applying of heating and moiſtening Medicaments, it afterward exciteth and cauſeth a Cancer. But whether the Cancer be without any Ulcer or no; and whether the black Choler be mild and moderate, or elſe exulcerated, and the cauſe more ſharp; yet however notwithſtanding, in, and of it ſelf it is alwaies without a Feaver; although accidentally a Feaver may happen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. In the mean time (we ſay) the Cancer it ſelf is a hot Tumor. For although ſome there be that doubt whether a Cancer be to be ranked and reckoned up among the hot or the cold Tumors; (as there be likewiſe that queſtion whether black Choler be a hot or a cold humor;) and although by the Arabian Phyſitians a Cancer is accounted and reckoned up among the cold Tumors, and <hi>Galen</hi> ſeem to incline thereunto, in his Book of black Choler, Chap. 4. and in his 2. to <hi>Glauco,</hi> Chap. 10. yet notwithſtanding it is by the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Tumors, Chap. 8, 10, 11. moſt rightly and truly reckoned up among the hot Tumors; ſince that it hath its original, not from the Melancholy humor cold and dry, but from black Choler, hot and dry. For albeit the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Humor may poſſibly give the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Tumor; yet however notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Cancer is not generated from it, unleſs the ſaid Melancholy Humor degenerate and turn into black Choler; whether this happen in the Veſſels, or in the part affected; like as ſomtimes a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> (as ere while we told you) that is produced from a Melancholy Humor may paſs and turn into a Cancer. And this is the conjunct cauſe of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; to wit, black Choler, a humor hot and dry, ſharp, Salt, corroding and corrupting al things; generated and bred from the heat of other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, the heat now ceaſing, or at leaſt being not ſo vigorous that it may excite and cauſe a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; as it is wont to be in a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> and <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe generated from other Cauſes. For
<pb n="2477" facs="tcp:49110:42"/> now and then a hot diſtemper burneth up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flameth the Humor, and ſo generateth black cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: and ſomtimes the Food (Meat and Drink) being ſuch as hath in it a diſpoſition and tendency unto the generating of ſuch a like humor, by the frequent uſe thereof, and in proceſs of time, beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Cauſe of black Choler: and ſomtimes the very Spleen it ſelf being grown weak, and not able to attract and draw unto it ſelf that that is generated of the Melancholly humor, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon leave this humor in the Body, which after it hath been for a while deteined in the Body is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and burnt up. The very ſame likewiſe happeneth, if either the monthly Courſes (in Women) be ſuppreſſed, or the Hemorrhoids ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
                     <p>And in truth, the Cancer is generated and bred in all the parts, both external and internal; and yet notwithſtanding it eſpecially appeareth (as <hi>Celſus</hi> tels us in his (fifth Book, Chap. 28.) in the ſuperior parts, about the Face, Noſethrils, and Ears, Lips, the Paps or Breaſts of Women; which chiefly (by reaſon of their laxity and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) do very eaſily receive that humor; and then again (in regard of the conſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it hath with the Womb) they readily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of thoſe vitious and naughty humors that ought to have been purged forth through the Womb.</p>

                     <head>The Signs Diagnoſtick.</head>
                     <p>At the firſt beginning the <hi>Cancer</hi> is not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known; becauſe that at firſt it is ſcarcely ſo big as a Vetch or a Bean: but then afterwards, when it is grown, and hath gotten ſo much augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enlargement that it is now lift up into a greater bulk, it hath with it then ſigns and ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſo evident and ſo grievous, that it by any one may be moſt eaſily known. For this Tumor is hard, it hath a leaden, or wan, or blackiſh color; and yet notwithſtanding this is more or leſs ſuch, according to the diverſity of the matter. There is preſent likewiſe a pain to attend it; the which (although it may indeed be ſometimes greater, and ſomtimes leſs) yet notwithſtanding the <hi>Cancer</hi> is never wholly without it. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſent an heat, pulſation or beating; and round about (as it were in a Circle) it hath Veins diſtended, and ſtrutting out with black Blood. Now although the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> ariſing from a melancholly humor hath ſome kind of likeneſs and affinity with a <hi>Cancer;</hi> yet notwithſtanding by the aforeſaid and other ſigns it may eaſily be diſcerned from it. For a <hi>Cancer</hi> hath evermore a pain and pulſation conjoyned therewith, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an heat more than ordinary; and moſt commonly it beginneth of it ſelf, and ſuddenly getteth encreaſe, ſo that from a very ſmal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable bigneſs it becometh exceeding great and bulky; and there is for the moſt part a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor reſiding in the Veins, which ſaid Veins being therewith filled very full reſemble the Feet and Claws of Creviſh or Craw-fiſh. But now in the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> there is no pain appearing; and for the moſt part it hath its original from the Change and alteration of other Tumors; and the humor that produceth the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> doth not chiefly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſide in the Veins, but in the ſpaces and Pores of the Parts; from whence alſo it is, that the Veins are not ample, wide, and large, neither turgid, and ſtrutting out; and the increaſing and growth thereof is much more ſlow than that of a <hi>Cancer.</hi> But now if the Cancer be already Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated, then the Ulcer is naſty and ſtinking, the lips are ſwoln, thick, and pale or wan.</p>

                     <head>The Prognoſticks.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. In the general, every <hi>Cancer</hi> is a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and a dangerous Diſeaſe; and ſuch as is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never cured. For the Cauſe thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over thick is obſtinate and malignant; and oftentimes it ſeizeth and ſurprizeth even thoſe Veins alſo that lie low and deep; inſomuch that it cannot be removed and taken away, either by the purgation of the Body, or by Repellers, or Diſcuſſives, or cutting and lancing, or laſtly, even by actual Cauteries and burning; for as for the milder ſort of Remedies, it ſleights and contemns them; and as for the ſtronger ſort of Medicaments, it is by them exaſperated.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Where there are ſecret and hidden Cancers, there it is beſt not to cure them; For they that are cured die within a very ſhort time after, but thoſe that are not cured of theſe aforeſaid Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers live a longer time, ſo ſaith <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in the ſixth of his Aphoriſms, Aphor. 38. For why, thoſe Cancers that before were not exulcerated when they have Medicaments applied to them may and do eaſily become exulcerated.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They likewiſe that have Cancers in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Body, or in the palate of the mouth, or in the Buttocks, or in the Womb, if they be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cut or burnt, the Ulcers cannot by any means be healed up, and covered over with a Cicatrice. But thoſe that are thus affected while they lie under Cure are tortured and tormented (even to death) by the afflicting pain they undergo; whereas without a Cure (and if they ſhall not at all ſubmit themſelves unto the means tending thereunto) they may live a longer time, and with far leſs trouble and grievance; as <hi>Galen</hi> hath it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his Commentary upon the aforeſaid Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thoſe Cancers only therefore are to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in the way of Cure, which are and appear in the outward part of the Body; and there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will be more ſafe to attempt the Curing of them by Medicaments in the very firſt riſe of them (while they are yet but ſmal and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable) than when they are grown and become great; for then they are not to be cured without the help of the Hand; (which we term the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="2478" facs="tcp:49110:43"/> operation) neither indeed ſo, unleſs they have their reſidence and ſituation in thoſe parts that may without danger be lanced and burnt, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the very Roots, that is to ſay, the Veins in them that are full of burnt of aduſt blood.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. For when the Cancer hath once gotten poſſeſſion of a great part; or when it ſticketh faſt in a more noble part, or any other that may not ſafely and conveniently be cut or burnt, it is then altogether incurable.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Yea moreover, (in the general) there are very many, and indeed the moſt Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that are of opinion, that no Cancer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and exulcerated can poſſibly be cured.</p>
                     <p>And it is oftentimes obſerved, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Cancers be cut out, and now and then cured in the external parts; Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that the ſame have returned again either in the very ſame part, or elſe even in ſome other parts; as for inſtance, when the Cancer hath been cured in the paps or breaſts another hath ſoon after riſen and ſprung up in the Womb. And therefore we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo far forth (and no further) to cure thoſe Cancers that are already inveterate, and of the greater ſize, that their further growth and augmentation may be impeded and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (to my beſt remembrance) do I know any one, who accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and eſteemeth the Cancer to be in the number of contagious Diſeaſes; excepting only <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus,</hi> in the firſt Book of his Practice, and Adminiſtr. of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and 124. Obſervat. who doth it, and endeavoreth to prove it both by Reaſon and Experience. His Reaſons are, 1. Becauſe, that in an exulcerated Cancer there is preſent a certain putridneſs and noyſom ſtench (as it were of a dead Carkaſs) that by its purulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy infecteth the body that is nigh unto it. His ſecond Reaſon is, Becauſe the Cancer is the ſame Diſeaſe with an <hi>Elephantiaſis,</hi> and Leproſie of one only Member; but now the <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> is moſt contagious.<note place="margin">An Anſwer thereto.</note> But theſe his Reaſons do not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conclude any thing. For firſt, Al things that are putrid and ill favoured and noyſom are not contagious. For in a Gangrene and <hi>Sphacelus</hi> there is an extraordinary putridneſs and ſtench; and yet notwithſtanding the ſtander by is not therewith infected. And moreover, although a Cancer hath ſome kind of ſimilitude and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with an <hi>Elephantiaſis;</hi> they are yet notwithſtanding ſeveral and different af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as <hi>Cardanus</hi> in the place alleadged hath very rightly determined. And therefore Experience is to be conſulted.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> From Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</note> Now <hi>Zacutus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitanus</hi> in the place before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged bringeth in and produceth this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: He there writeth, That a certain poor woman having had a Cancer exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in her Breaſt for many yeers together, and lying in bed with her three ſons, they were all infected with the like contagion; &amp; that ſhe after five yeers dying, two of theſe her three ſons ſeized upon and diſpatcht by this Diſeaſe departed this life; but the third (ſomwhat ſtronger of conſtitution than the other two) after that the Cancer had been cut away by the hand of the Chirurgeon, with much pains and ado was cured and healed.<note place="margin">An Anſwer to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note> But this being but one example, Experience is yet further to be conſulted: and the rather in regard that it may be here objected, that thoſe her ſons might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this Diſeaſe, not by contagion, but from an hereditary infection.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>As for what therefore concerneth the Cure of a Cancer not exulcerated, in the very firſt place (and this indeed is generally to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in al Cancers whatſoever) before any thing elſe be done, we are to uſe our diligent endeavor to prevent the encreaſe of black Choler, and that none be generated for the future; and that what is already in the body may ſpeedily be evacuated. The breeding of black Choler and the Melancholy Humor is to be hindered and prevented by the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents abſtaining from thoſe Meats that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way yield and afford matter to the black Humor; ſuch as are al things that are thick, feculent, ſalt, bitter; and ſuch are old cheeſe, fleſh that is thick, old, ſalt, or ſmoak-dried, Garlick, Onions, Muſtard, Pepper, and al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spices. Let the ſick perſon likewiſe ſhun and avoid al thoſe things that do any way conduce to the generating of the black Humor; ſuch as are Grief, and ſadneſs of the heart, overmuch watching and want of reſt, and the like. But rather let the Patient uſe a Diet that is moderately moiſtening and cooling; viz. Ptiſan of Barley, Lettice, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Borrage, Succory, the four cold Seeds, Veal, Wether Mutton, Kids fleſh, Chickens, Reer Eggs, River fiſh, the Whey of Goats Milk, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <pb n="2479" facs="tcp:49110:43"/>
                     <p>Furthermore, If there be any aduſt Humor already generated in the Body, let it be with al ſpeed evacuated. And therefore in the firſt place (if it be at al requiſite) blood may be drawn forth by opening a Vein. In Women, the provoking and bringing down their Courſes wil be moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and convenient; and in men let the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids be opened, if it may be done. After this, let the body be throughly purged with thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments that e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>te the black aduſt Humor; among which there is eſpecially commended E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithymum, (we vulgarly cal it Mother of Tyme) black Hellebore, Fumitory; and the Compounds thence derived, viz. the Pils of Fumitory, and the Confection Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, that thick and groſs Humor is firſt of al to be prepared; yea more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, wheras the whol Humor may not at once and al together be evacuated, then the Purgers and Preparers are often to be repeated, by turns, and ſucceſſively. Now for this Affect, thoſe things that are very proper and convenient, are, the Syrup of Apples, of Fumitory, of the Juyce of Borrage and Bugloſs, Syrup of Lupulus or the Hop: or other Compound Medicaments like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe. Neither wil it be amiſs, or any whit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, likewiſe to ſtrengthen the Heart and the Liver; and if there be any diſtemper chanced unto either or both of them, to amend and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it by Medicaments, or Borrage, Bugloſs, Roſes, Citrons, Sanders, Corals, Margarites, Pearls, and thoſe other Medicaments that are made and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded out of theſe.</p>
                     <p>And then in the next place, we are to apply our ſelves unto the very part affected; And, 1. By Topicks the Matter that hath flown in is a little to be driven back again, and diſcuſſed; and the part is to be confirmed and ſtrengthened; and thoſe Medicaments that have in them a power and vertue of Repreſſing, Corroborating, and Diſucſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, are to be applied. For by this means, ſo much of the Cancer as is already generated is quite taken away; and likewiſe the further growth and increaſe thereof is prevented. But now, let thoſe Medicaments have in them a mediocrity (or mean) of ſtrength and vertue; and let them not be ſharp and biting. For if the Medicaments be over weak, they then afford no help or benefit; and again, if they be too ſtrong and violent, they then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed either repreſs or diſcuſs the more thin parts; but for the more thick, they do not only leave them behind, but alſo render them the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt and unfit to be afterwards diſcuſſed and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated. There is for this uſe and purpoſe very convenient, the Decoction or Juyce of Nightſhade, and of the ſeveral Species of Endive and Succory. But more eſpecially there are commended the Cockle-fiſh boyled, River Crabs or Creviſhes; and principally green Frogs, out of which there is a moſt excellent Oyl to be diſtilled, for the moderating of the pain, and the healing of the are Cancer; the deſtillation is by deſcent, after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Green Frogs, living either in the Reeds, or in pure and cleer Waters; fill their mouths with Butter, and afterward put them into an Earthen Pot that is glazed, and having in its bottom many little holes. Let this Pot be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Pot, and that other Pot put into and ſurrounded with the Earth, in the which it is to be as it were ſhut up: and then let as wel the Pot that hath the Cover, as that Pot which is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it be carefully luted and ſtopt; that ſo nothing may exhale. Afterward, let the fire be kindled round about the Pot on every ſide; and the Oyl wil deſtil into the lower pot, which is to be taken forth, and together with the Pouder of the Frogs mingled, for the making of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others there are that make up an Unguent with the Aſhes of Crabs or Crawfiſh mingled together with Coriander ſeed, and the Oyl of Roſes. And here likewiſe we are to make uſe of the greateſt part of Metallicks waſhed, and ſo becoming alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without any biting quality (their power and vertue being here of ſingular uſe:) ſuch as are Lead, Tutia or Pompholyx, Litharge, Ceruſs, Antimony. Lead is chiefly and moſt highly commended by al; and it may likewiſe be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred any manner of way. Whereupon it is that al thoſe Medicaments that are to be applied in the Cancer are moſt fitly and properly made up in a Leaden Mortar, with a Leaden Peſtle, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which <hi>Galen</hi> is to be conſulted; ſee in his 9 Book of the Faculty of ſimple Medicaments, and the Chapter of Lead; which is made by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing together two Leaden Plates (whereon the Oyl of Roſes hath been poured) ſo long until the Oyl become ſomwhat blackiſh, and that it hath gotten the conſiſtence of a Liniment; or if in a Leaden Mortar the Oyl of Roſes be ſtirred about with a Leaden Peſtle, ſo long, that it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wax ſomthing black, and become thick. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Oyl of Roſes two ounces; the Juyce of Nightſhade an ounce and half; Ceruſs or white Lead waſhed, Lead burnt and waſhed, of each one dram: Litharge, Frankincenſe, Pompho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyx or the ſoyl of Braſs, of each half a dram; White Wax as much as wil ſerve the turn: make an <hi>

                     <p>Take <hi>Terra Sigillata or the Sealed Earth of Lemnos, Bole-armenick, Ceruſs, of each half an ounce; Tutia prepared two drams: Pouder of green Frogs three drams: Litharge one dram and half; Oyl of Roſes an ounce and half; Oyl of Frogs an ounce; Vinegar ſix drams; Wax a ſufficient quantity: ſhake and ſtir them about for a good while in a Leaden Mortar, and ſo make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>

                     <p>And indeed this is the ſafer way of curing Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that lie hid and ſecret in the body, and ſuch as are not a yet exulcerated. For albeit <hi>Avìceré</hi>

Aphoriſm, Section 6. For the Cancer (eſpecially if any thing great) if it be wholly cut forth, and as it were ſtub'd up by the roots, then inſtantly there wil follow thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (the Veins and Arteries being cut aſunder) an extraordinary and dangerous flux of blood; which if it be intercepted with a binder, then there wil be an extraordinary great and grievous pain excited in the other parts; if they be feared and burnt, this likewiſe cannot be done without much inconvenience; and yet nevertheleſs there wil be great danger of its returning.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Cure of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerated Cancer.</note>But now, whereas the moſt are of Opinion that the exulcerated Cancer is not at al to be attempted or medled with, yet notwithſtanding it being very inhumane to leave the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (even in ſuch a Diſeaſe) altogether deſtitute of help and aſſiſtance, there is therefore by Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians appointed and ſet down a twofold way and method of curing theſe exulcerated Cancers; the one true and genuine, which tendeth to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the very Cancer it ſelf; the other only Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liative (as they term it) which eaſeth, aſſwageth, and in ſome ſor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> qualifieth the Cancer, ſo that the ſick perſon may live with ſomwhat the leſs pain and grievance. The true Cure is performed either by Inciſion, or Searing, or burning Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments; which indeed are moſt eſpecially to be adminiſtred, if the Cancer hath not yet attained unto any conſiderable growth and bigneſs; or elſe if it be in thoſe parts where it may without danger be cut forth, or burnt. It may be ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and cut away even to the very quick, that ſo whatſoever is vitious and corrupt may be wholly taken away, ſo that there may be no fear left of any remaining contagion. And ſomtimes only cutting wil ſuffice, and by it the whol Cancer may be grubb'd up even by the very roots. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation being made, the blood is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and ſtopt from flowing, before it ſhal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appear that al thereof that is vitious and corrupt be flown forth out of the Veins: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dry Liniments are to be put upon the part that was cut, and the Ulcer is to be concocted or ripened, cleanſed, filled up with fleſh, and a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrice drawn over it, and ſo the Vein to be ſhut up. But ſomtimes again, if the Cancer be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great, and black Choler hath likewiſe ſeized upon the greater and deeper Veſſels, then in this caſe Section alone wil not ſuffice, but beſides the ſaid cutting burning is alſo to be adminiſtred. And therefore in the firſt place, that Skin being taken off, the Cancerous part it ſelf, together with al the blackiſh Veins, is as much as poſſibly may be to be taken forth, and the blood likewiſe (according to the ſtrength of the Patient) is not inſtantly to be ſuppreſſed and ſtopt, but rather to be further preſſed and ſqueezed forth, that ſo al the black Choler may by this means flow forth of the Veins. After this the place is to be feared with a fire-hot Iron, that ſo the Hemorrhage and bleeding may thereby be ſtanched, and the reliques of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant matter waſted and conſumed. And at length thoſe things that take away the cruſt, cleanſe the Ulcer, generate and breed fleſh, and produce a Cicatrice, are to be adminiſtred. But others (leſt that the ſick perſon ſhould be endangered by the Hemorrhage and extream bleeding, or together with the loſs of his blood ſhould loſe his life alſo, and leſt the Chirurgeon by the flux of blood might likewiſe be hindered in his operation) do not in the like manner as aforeſaid amputate the whol Cancer, and after that at length burn the whol; but firſt of al they cut off a certain part thereof, and then (after that a ſufficient quantity and portion of the blood is flown forth) they burn and fear the ſaid part; and then again a ſecond time they amputate and cut off another part thereof, and again burn it; and thus in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by turns iterating and repeating the Section and amputation, as alſo the burning and learing, they do at length quite take away the whol part affected with the Cancer. The Cancer may alſo be burnt with Cauſtick Medicaments, among which there is commended Sublimate Arſenick. But there ought to be a ſpecial regard had unto the places and parts that lie round about it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this reſpect may crude Arſenick be (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much hazard and danger) thus adminiſtred. That Arſenick is more ſafe that is poured forth mingled, and fixed with <hi>Salnitre,</hi> or the Salt of Nitre.</p>
                     <p>But now, in regard that the great fear that here eſpecially perplexeth Phyſitians is touching the recidivation and return of the Affect, thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments therefore that evacuate black Choler are often to be repeated, and likewiſe thoſe that have in them a power and vertue to draw forth the Hemorrhoids, and the Courſes. Inſtead of which (if they be wanting) ſome there be that cauſe Iſſues to be made. But in this caſe, we are not only to adminiſter ſuch Medicaments as prepare and purge forth black Choler, but thoſe likewiſe that reſiſt and oppoſe poyſons, and ſuch as are known to be expedient in regard of their whol ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſuch as have in them the property and ſovereign vertue of Antidotes. And for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we are to adminiſter Treacle and Mithridate, with Borrage, Cichory, and the Juyce or Syrup of Sorrel, the Broth of River Crabs out of Aſſes Milk,
<pb n="2481" facs="tcp:49110:44"/> and the Antidote likewiſe that is made of their Blood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antonius Chalmetaeus</hi> (in all kind of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers) commendeth this Water; which he likewiſe uſeth nine daies before the exciſion, or cutting forth of the Cancer.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Thapſus barbatus or ſweet white Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein, the Root of Water Betony, of each two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Dropwort, Spleenwort, Agrimony, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil, Scabious, Avens, Toad-flax, of each one handful; Nettle ſeed three drams, Flowers of Elder, Roſemary flowers, of each one pugil or ſmal handful.</hi> Make a Decoction, which may be dulcified with Sugar; with ſome part of which Decoction the place affected may be likewiſe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and throughly waſhed, and afterward a <hi>Magma</hi> or ſweet Confection may be applied in the form of a Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>The other way of curing the Cancer is that that we cal a Counterfeit or Palliative Cure; by which we only uſe our endeavor that the Cancer may not be augmented and get any further growth; and that the pain thereof may be aſſwaged; that ſo the ſick Perſon may lengthen out, and lead the remainder of his life with the leſs excruciating and afflicting miſery. Such Medicaments are thoſe that do not putrifie, neither corrode and bite the part, but do moderately dry and cool it; and they are ſuch as are above mentioned; and more of them you may likewiſe ſee in the fourth Book of our Practiſe, Sect. 3.

                     <p>Now ſome there are that divide the Cancer into three Species or kinds; into the Cancer that is by the Greeks &amp; Romans abſolutely and ſpecifically ſo called, and which is commonly and wel known by that name; into the <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> and the Wolf. And they then only term it <hi>Noli me tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi> when there ariſeth a Tumor or Ulcer upon the Chin, and eſpecially about the Mouth and Noſe, bearing a reſemblance with, and being very like unto an exulcerated Cancer, growing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing very ſlowly at the beginning; which (as <hi>Theodoricus</hi> truly telleth us) continueth for one whol yeer no bigger than a Puſtule, and is as it were a very ſmal and inconſiderable Puſh; and which afterwards and at all times creepeth leſs than the Cancer: and <hi>Rogerius</hi> in his fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter writeth, that the Cancer doth corrode more in one day, than <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> doth in a Month. And it is ſo called, either becauſe it ought not to be rubbed (ſince the more it is handled and rub'd the worſe it becomes) or elſe in regard that it is a Contagious Malady; or elſe laſtly, becauſe it is rather exaſperated then mitigated by Remedies, and is thereby cauſed to creep into the ſound parts.</p>
                     <p>But they cal it <hi>Lupus</hi> or the Wolf, if it be in the Shins, Ankle-bones, and Thighs.

But now from what cauſes theſe watery &amp; wheyiſh humors proceed and come to be gathered together, we have already declared where we treated of the <hi>Hydrops</hi> or Dropſie. Now for the place, the watry and wheyiſh humor is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in ſome part that is looſe, or that hath in it a Cavity or hollowneſs.</p>

                     <p>Theſe watery Tumors are ſoft, lax or looſe, and without pain. If they be preſſed and thruſt down, the print of the finger that maketh the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion doth not remain: and if we view them wel either by day-light, or Candle-light, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear tranſparent, and ſuch as may welnigh be ſeen through.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. But thoſe that have their original from ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs either in the Liver, or in the Spleen, although they are not in themſelves dangerous, yet they do notwithſtanding threaten danger, in regard of the Bowels that are ill affected.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Although watry Tumors are not dangerous; yet notwithſtanding they are not eaſily cured, ſince that the humor is hardly or not at all to be concocted, and is likewiſe diſcuſſed very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

                     <p>That ſo the Cure may rightly be performed, the the watry humor which cauſeth and cheriſheth the Tumor is to be evacuated and emptied forth; and ſpeciall care muſt be taken that no more of it be generated in the Body for the future, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor it ſelf that is in the part affected is to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, the watry and wheyiſh humors are to be evacuated by Stool, by Urine, and by Sweats; and we muſt likewiſe ſo order it, that the <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> and inſenſible tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration may be free and uninterrupted.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If there be preſent any fault in any Bowel that is by Nature deſtin'd and ordained for Concoction (by which this watry humor is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied) this is to be corrected; and of this we have already ſpoken in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The watery matter (the next and conteining Cauſe of the Tumor) is to be evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; which is to be performed, either inſenſibly by thoſe things that Reſolve and digeſt, and dry much; or elſe ſenſibly, by opening the Tumor, and pouring out the Matter. Thoſe things that Reſolve, Diſcuſs, and dry up the watry humors, are, Rue, Wallwort or Danewort, Elder, Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, Dill, the Flower-de-luce root, Ariſtolochy or Birthwort, Laurel berries, the Meal of Beans, and of the bitter Vetch <hi>Orobus,</hi> Aſhes, Salt, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Ammoniacum, and Bdellium. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Rue, of the Elder Tree, and Wallwort, the Flowers of Camomile, of each one handful; Lawrel berries two ounces; boyl them in Ley and Wine, for a Fomentation.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Sal Nitre half an ounce, Sulphur three drams, the Pouder of Lawrel berries one ounce, Ammoniacum half an ounce, Oyl of Rue and Wax, of each as much as will ſuffice; and make a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the matter cannot be diſcuſſed and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, then let the Tumor be opened, and the mater emptied forth.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BUt now it is very rare (and a thing that but ſeldom happeneth) that one only humor ſhould excite and cauſe any Tumor whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but for the moſt part, many humors mixed together, and eſpecially the Cholerick, Salt, and ferous or wheyiſh humors, meeting together (and ſomtimes alſo black Choler) do excite and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce divers ſorts of Tubercles or ſmall Tumors; of which we intend now to treat; and here in the explanation of their ſeveral names, we meet with much difficulty. And firſt of all, <hi>Exanthemata,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exanthemata.</note> and <hi>Exantheſis</hi> (that is to ſay, Effloreſcences) are ſo called, in regard that like unto Flowers they break forth in the Skin. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 3. Epid. Comm. Text 51. calleth them likewiſe <hi>Ecthyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> from the Greek, becauſe they impetuouſly break forth, as <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> explaineth it. <hi>Pliny</hi> (in his Book 24. and Chap. 4. and Book 26. Chap 11.) calleth them <hi>Eruptiones.</hi> But now the name <hi>[Exan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themata]</hi> ſeemeth to be a general name, ſo that it may comprehend under it whatſoever of its own accord breaketh forth in the Skin; neither indeed is there any certain and particular ſpecies of thoſe Tubercles or ſmal Tumors, whereupon it is that they are likewiſe called <hi>Exanthemata Sublime</hi>
                     <pb n="2483" facs="tcp:49110:45"/> broad, red, round, ſmal, <hi>Exanthemata</hi> of ſweats, <hi>Elcode,</hi> by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his third Book of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſms, Aphor. 20. But whether or no there be any general Latin word that may anſwer unto this <hi>Exanthemata</hi> of the Greeks, I very much queſtion. We indeed meet with the name of <hi>Papulae,</hi> and <hi>Puſtulae,</hi> that is to ſay, Wheals, Bliſters, Meaſels, and Puſhes. But now whereas there is a twofold ſort of <hi>Exanthemata,</hi> one that which only changeth the color of the Skin (as it is wont to be in thoſe Feavers that we cal <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiales;</hi>) and another, in which there are certain Tubercles breaking forth in the Skin, the name of <hi>Papulae</hi> and <hi>Puſtulae</hi> ſeemeth not to agree with, and anſwer to both of them, but only unto the latter ſort of the <hi>Exanthemata;</hi> for <hi>Papulae</hi> and <hi>Puſtulae</hi> ſignifie only Tubercles in which there is ſome certain humor contained. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we find that the name of <hi>Papulae</hi> is a more ſpecial name; and that it ſeemeth not to be uſed by <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> in one and the ſame manner. For by <hi>Pliny</hi> the hotter ſort of <hi>Exan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themata,</hi> and which are elevated higher than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary into a ſharp-pointed head, are termed <hi>Papu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae;</hi> of which notwithſtanding ſeeing that there are many differences (viz. red, hot, black, <hi>Papu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae</hi> of ſweats) this name ſeemeth to be general e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. But now with <hi>Celſus</hi> the name <hi>Papulae</hi> is a ſpecial and peculiar name, and ſignifieth only that affect which the Greeks cal <hi>Lichenes,</hi> and the Latines <hi>Impetigo.</hi> For thus he writeth (in his fifth Book, and 28. Chapter) That the <hi>Papu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae</hi> by the ſmalleſt ſort of Puſtules do exaſperate the Skin, and likewiſe that they corrode and creep forward but ſlowly; and that where the Diſeaſe beginneth round, there it alſo proceedeth after an Orb-like and round manner; and that that which is leſs round is more difficultly cured; and that (unleſs it be taken quite away) it turne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Impetigo.</hi> For he maketh two ſpecies of <hi>Lichenes,</hi> as the Greeks likewiſe do. One he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Agria,</hi> that is, wild; the other more mild; and that the wild <hi>Papula</hi> is cured by rubbing it with faſting Spittle. All which things before mentioned agree with the <hi>Lichenes</hi> of the Greeks.</p>
                  <p>The name likewiſe of <hi>Eczeſmata</hi> ſeemeth to be general. For although ſome by theſe <hi>Eczeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> underſtand only <hi>Hidroa,</hi> or <hi>Sudamina;</hi> and others refer them unto the Head alone; yet without al doubt this name is general, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a Puſtule, or very hot <hi>Papula,</hi> as the name it ſelf importeth.</p>

                     <hi>EPinyctis</hi> is ſo called, becauſe it ariſeth in the Night; as <hi>Galen</hi> (in his ſecond Book of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 2. and <hi>Celſus</hi> (in his fifth Book, and 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter) hath informed us. Yet notwithſtanding <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> (in his 4. Book, Chap. 9.) and <hi>Aetius</hi> Tetrab. 4. Serm. 2. Chap. 61. conceive that they are ſo called, not becauſe it ariſeth in the night, but becauſe in the night time it doth more vehemently excruciate and torment the Party thus affected. But both theſe reaſons may very wel ſtand together, to wit, that this Tubercle ariſeth by night, and that it doth likewiſe in the night time moſt grieve &amp; excruciate the Party affected therewith. <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> therefore, and <hi>Aetius</hi> (in the places alleadged) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the <hi>Epinyctides</hi> to be ſmall Ulcers breaking forth of their own accord, like unto <hi>Phlyctaenae</hi> or Bliſters, ſomwhat reddiſh, which being broken there iſſueth forth a bloody filth and matter. They do not greatly excruciate the Party in the day time; but by night they torture and torment him with a pain that is more then uſual in an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. But yet, although <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine <hi>Epinyctides</hi> by little Ulcers; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding without all doubt they underſtand Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtules degenerating and turning into Ulcers. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they generated only of Cholerick and bloody filth and corruption, but likewiſe from other humors alſo. And therefore <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Book 20. and Chap. 6. calleth them pale and wan Puſtules, and ſuch as diſquiet in the night time. But <hi>Celſus</hi> in the place alleadged doth moſt cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly deſcribe them, in theſe words; <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the worſt of all kind of Puſtules, that is called</hi> Epinyctis. <hi>It is wont to be in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour either ſomwhat pale and wan, or ſomwhat black, or elſe white. About this there is alſo a vehement Inflammation, and within there is found a ſnotty and naſty exulceration. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is like unto its humor from whence it ariſeth. The pain that it cauſeth is greater than its big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and tranſcendeth its magnitude, for it is no bigger then a Bean. And it likewiſe ariſeth in the eminent parts, and moſt commonly in the night time; for which cauſe it hath this name</hi> Epinyctis <hi>impoſed upon it by the Greeks.</hi>

                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>The Cauſes of this Tumor are a Salt and whey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh humor, and Flegm, together with which there is ſomtimes mingled ſome of the Blood, and Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick <hi>Ichor,</hi> and now and then likewiſe ſome of the black Choler. From whence alſo it is that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is not alwaies one and the ſame, and by reaſon of the Flegm therwith mingled the Puſtule being opened there is found within a certain ſnotty and filthy exulceration. And the Tumor is almoſt if not altogether ſuch as that which cauſeth the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, but only that there is here no malignity preſent; neither is the Tumor likewiſe here ſo great as it is in a Carbuncle; neither is it (as we told you out of <hi>Celſus</hi>) bigger then a Bean. But that it is more exaſperated by night, the Cauſe hereof is a black humor (that is wont to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more in the night) and the nocturnal cold, which ſhutteth and cloſeth up the Pores of the Skin.</p>

                  <p>THere is alſo a certain kind of Tumor (which we but very ſeldom meet with in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Greeks and Latines; but oftentimes mentioned by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and now &amp; then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the Phyſitians of our own time, ſuch eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as live neer us in our own Country) which they cal <hi>Eſſere, Sora,</hi> and <hi>Sare;</hi> to wit, when lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Tubercles, inclining to a red colour, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard, do ſuddenly and unexpectedly ſeiz upon the whol Body, together with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary &amp; troubleſom itching; Juſt as if the Party had been bitten and ſtung by Bees, or Waſps, or Gnats, or ſtung with Nettles; and yet notwithſtanding ſo that after a long time they vaniſh again; &amp; the Skin likewiſe (without the iſſuing forth of an ichorous excrement, or any other moiſture whatſoever) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth its former ſmoothneſs and colour. There are ſome indeed that refer theſe kind of Tubercles unto the aforeſaid <hi>Epinyctides</hi> of the Greeks; but they are here in miſtaken. For <hi>Epinyctides</hi> and <hi>Eſſere</hi> are Tumors altogether differing one from the other; in regard that <hi>Epinyctides</hi> pour forth out of them a certain humor, which <hi>Eſſere</hi> doth not, but vaniſheth without any kind of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor iſſuing there from. Moreover the <hi>Epinyctides</hi> (according to the name they have thereupon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them) do afflict and grieve the Patient moſt of all in the night time; but the <hi>Eſſere</hi> very rarely break forth in the night, but (for the moſt part) in the day time. The way and Method of Curing them is likewiſe very various and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                  <p>It is ſomwhat doubtful whether or no this kind of Tumor was at all known to the <hi>Grecians;</hi> ſince that we meet not (in any of their writings) with the true and proper kind of this Tumor; neither do they make any the leaſt mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; unleſs haply there be any that will refer this Tumor <hi>Eſſere</hi> unto <hi>Exanthemata</hi> that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serapio</hi> in the fifth of his Breviary, and Chap. 8. maketh a twofold ſort of this Tumor, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring according to the Nature and quality of their Cauſes. The one he deriveth from cholerick blood; the other from a ſalt and nitrous Flegm; but this more rare. Others there are that aſſert that this kind of Tumor doth ariſe from an exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or vapour of hot fervent Blood, or elſe the admixture of the Cholerick and Salt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>Whoſoever knoweth and underſtandeth the Nature of ſerous wheyiſh humors wil not deny that ſuch like Tubercles may poſſibly be excited from ſerous or wheyiſh humors, being ſuch as are ſharp and eaſily moved, and likewiſe ſuch as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ado vaniſh and are diſcuſſed. Which appeareth, and may be confirmed even from hence,
<pb n="2488" facs="tcp:49110:48"/> that this Malady may be, and is removed eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by Veneſection or blood-letting, which ſaid Veneſection doth chiefly and principally qualifie and allay that extream and fervent heat of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and wheyiſh part of the blood. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the itch that is ſomtimes greater, and ſomtimes leſs, likewiſe teacheth us, that there is not one alone difference of this wheyiſh humor; but that ſomtimes this ſaid whey is more mild and moderate, and ſomtimes again more ſharp and hot; ſomtimes thinner, and ſomtimes thicker; as likewiſe thus much (which I my ſelf have very often obſerved) that theſe Tubercles (while the the Patients are in a hot place) they then break forth and appear, and that when they expoſe themſelves unto a cold Air, the <hi>Eſſere</hi> then vaniſh; and as ſoon again (on the contrary) to bud forth in the cold Air, and to vaniſh in a hot place: the former whereof ſeemeth from hence to happen, to wit, becauſe the humor is very thin and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and therefore is inſtantly driven in again by the cold ambient Air; but the latter, becauſe the Humor is not altogether ſo movable and thin, but ſomwhat more thick, which for that very cauſe cannot tranſpire in a cold Air; but in a hotter Air it wil tranſpire or breathe through.</p>
                     <p>But this wheyiſh and thin Humor is for the moſt part generated from the fault of the Liver; which from ſome preternatural cauſe is diſpoſed to generate and breed this humor. Now that ſaid Humor waxeth extreamly hot from the Cauſes Procatartick (as they cal them) that ſtir and move the blood. And this happeneth likewiſe in the Winter time, and in cold Regions, rather than in hot.</p>

Theſe Tubercles vaniſh of their own accord within a very ſhort ſpace, although there be no courſe taken for the curing of them; and they are not ſuppurated; neither doth there iſſue forth of them any humidity at al. And if this ſhould ſomtimes ſo happen, yet this chanceth rather by reaſon of the ſcratching of them, and alſo from the vehemency of the Itch (which is extream trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom to the ſick perſons) than by means of the Tumor.</p>

To wit, in the firſt place a Vein is to be opened, and ſo much of the blood drawn forth as the ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body requireth. And afterwards, if there be any need at al thereof, the Cholerick and wheyiſh Humor is to be drawn forth by Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds, Myrobalans, Rheubarb; afterward let there be adminiſtred the Juyce and Syrup of Pomegranates, Ribes, Syrup <hi>de Agreſta,</hi> or Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juyce, Whey; with the Emulſion of the four cold ſeeds, and the like; Milk tart and ſowr, &amp;c.

                     <hi>SCabies</hi> or Scabbineſs ariſeth likewiſe from aduſt matter, as doth alſo the Itch; that is (as it were) a certain <hi>Praeludium</hi> and forerunner of Scabbineſs, and the like Affects. Now <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> by the Greeks and Latines is called <hi>Pſora,</hi> an Affect ſufficiently known; in the which there is not only preſent ſome kind of foulneſs and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the body, but a diſtemper alſo even of the very Skin, together with a ſwelling and exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; from whence it is, that the actions of the Skin are likewiſe hurt. But more eſpecially, in the <hi>Scabies</hi> or Scabbineſs, the top and utmoſt part of the Skin is affected; inſomuch that out of it (as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in his fourth upon the Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms, and the 17. Aphor.) there is ſome ſuch like thing caſt forth, that beareth a likeneſs and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with the caſting of Serpents. From whence it likewiſe differeth from the Itch: for in the Itch there is only a roughneſs of the Skin, in which there is nothing that fals off notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſcratching; whereas in the <hi>Scabies</hi> there is not only a roughneſs of the Skin, but likewiſe a diſtemper with a ſwelling; from which (by ſcratching) the bran-like bodies are eaſily and readily ſeparated; and together with them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Ichores</hi> likewiſe, and filthy purulent Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>But what the Cauſe of the <hi>Scabies</hi> is, in this Authors ſeem not ſo wel to agree. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Tumors, Chap. 1. &amp; 3. tels us that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi>
                        <pb n="2489" facs="tcp:49110:48"/> alſo, and <hi>Lepra</hi> are Melancholick Affects; and likewiſe in the ſeventh Sect. Aphor. 40. that <hi>Cancers, Elephantiaſes, Lepra's,</hi> and <hi>Pſora's,</hi> are al of them Melancholy Affects; and the ſame he alſo tels us in other places. But <hi>Avicen</hi> in the ſeventh Book of his fourth Tome, Tract. 3. Chap. 6. writeth that the matter of <hi>Scabies</hi> is the blood; with the which Choler is mingled, and that converted into Melancholy or ſalt flegm: and with him the other Arabian Phyſitians agree. But the very truth is, that although in the <hi>Scabies</hi> the humor be not alwaies one and the ſame, yet in every <hi>Scabies</hi> there is ſome kind of mixture of the aduſt and melancholy, hot and dry humor. And furthermore, there is one ſort of <hi>Scabies</hi> that is moiſt, another that is dry. The moiſt, in the which there ſloweth forth a certain matter that is moiſt, and withal rotten, filthy, and purulent; but the dry is that in which there is but little or none of the aforeſaid matter caſt forth. And concerning this latter it is that <hi>Galen</hi> ſeems to ſpeak, as being ſuch wherein that melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor doth more ſuperabound. But <hi>Avicen</hi> and the reſt of the Arabian Phyſitians underſtand hereby al kind of <hi>Scabies</hi> whatſoever. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the next cauſe of <hi>Scabies</hi> be a humor ſharp and ſalt; yet notwithſtanding <hi>Avicen</hi> doth not altogether abſurdly aſſert that blood is the matter of the <hi>Scabies.</hi> For ſeeing that <hi>Scabies</hi> is an Uniververſal Affect of the whol Body, it cannot therefore eaſily proceed from any other humor, unleſs that blood be likewiſe therewith mingled; and yet notwithſtanding the blood cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid to be ſimply the cauſe of <hi>Scabies;</hi> to wit, ſo long as it retaineth its benign and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Nature. For whileſt it continueth benign and good, it can in no wiſe excite and cauſe the itching, neither yet thoſe Ulcerous Tumors or Swellings. Wherefore, before ſuch time as the blood can poſſibly produce and breed the ſaid <hi>Scabies,</hi> it muſt of neceſſity be corrupted, and other humors that are ſharp and biting there with mingled. And true it is indeed, that yellow Choler is ſharp and corroding, but then it ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly floweth in ſo great abundance, or is of that thickneſs as to excite ſuch like Tumors. But black Choler and ſalt Flegm are Humors very fit and moſt apt to produce the ſaid <hi>Scabies.</hi> For theſe Humors being thick, hot and dry, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al biting and corroding, if they chance to be thruſt forth unto the Skin, there they ſtick faſt in it; and there they excite a hot and dry diſtemper, an it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, a ſwelling, and an exulceration.</p>
                     <p>But now as for the primitive Cauſes (and more eſpecially for the generating and breeding of thoſe ſalt, biting, and ſharp humors) the kind and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Diet that is kept doth exceedingly advance and further the ſame, Meats (to wit) of a bad juyce, and that afford an unwholſom and corrupt aliment; ſuch as are ſalt, ſharp, and that are eaſily corrupted. And hence it is, that the poorer ſort of people (who live upon theſe kind of unwholſom corrupt meats) are moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infeſted with the <hi>Scabies</hi> or Scabbineſs; as likewiſe Children, and yong people in general, in regard that theſe are altogether careleſs and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in their Diet; whereupon they contract great ſtore of excrements, that being retained in the outward part of the body are there corrupted, and ſo they get an acrimonious quality. But then from theſe bad and naughty meats thoſe ſharp and ſalt humors are the more eaſily bred if there be preſent a hot and dry diſtemper of the Liver. And hitherunto likewiſe relateth the uncleanneſs and naſtineſs of the body, to wit, when there is altogether a neglect in the keeping it ſweet and clean; and if the foulneſs and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the Skin be not duly waſhed off, or the garments not ſhifted and changed often enough; whereupon it is, that filth and impurities ſticking in the ſuperficies of the body do not permit ſo free a paſſage forth unto the excrements; and by this means the ſaid excrements acquire a certain acrimony, and ſo corrupt the other humors. The <hi>Scabies</hi> ariſeth likewiſe ſomtimes after a Criſis, and after Diſeaſes both acute, and thoſe alſo that are of a long continuance; to wit, when Nature expelleth forth unto the Skin thoſe naughty and depraved humors, which it is not able any other way to diſcuſs and evacuate. And laſtly, <hi>Congi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is likewiſe accounted and reckoned up among the principal cauſes of <hi>Scabies;</hi> which cauſe <hi>Galen</hi> alſo acknowledgeth, in his firſt Book of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Feavers, Chap. 2. and Book 4. of the Differences of Pulſes, Chap. 3. For in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Skin of thoſe that are Scabby there is a certain viſcous and clammy moiſture gathered together, which being either by the Apparel, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> by ſome other means communicated to the body, corrupteth the humors therein, after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and produceth the like Affection, and that eſpecially in theſe bodies that are now already diſpoſed unto the <hi>Scabies.</hi> And indeed the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid or moiſt <hi>Scabies</hi> is the more contagious, in regard that in this there is generated more of the aforeſaid viſcid and clammy humidity.</p>

Now although the <hi>Scabies</hi> be in this reſpect troubleſom, to wit, in regard of the foulneſs and deformity that it cauſeth in the Skin, rather than that it bringeth with it, or threateneth any other danger nigh at hand; and that in youth it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preſerveth, and likewiſe freeth from other Diſeaſes: yet notwithſtanding it is not alwaies ſecure and ſafe.

                     <p n="2">2. And among the ſeveral ſpecies and kinds of them, the dry is more difficult in curing than the moiſt.

                     <p>Now therefore in the firſt place, there is a due care and regard to be had in point of Diet; and there muſt be a totall abſtinence from thoſe Meats that generate aduſt and ſalt humors; <hi>Viz.</hi> all things that are ſalt, ſharp, bitter, Oyls themſelves, and whatſoever partaketh of an oyly Nature: and on the contrary, Meats of a good and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Juyce are conſtantly to be fed upon. And this may alſo be obſerved, and taken for a general rule, that it is more convenient that the food that is given unto Perſons that are thus affected (to wit, with Scabbineſs) be rather boyled than either roſt or fried. For what is either roaſted or fried, doth eſpecially generate a more ſharp and dry humor. After this, the acrimony &amp; ſharpneſs of the humors is to be qualified and tempered; and the diſtemper of the Liver is eſpecially to be reduced unto its priſtine Natural ſtate; and the ſalt and ſharp hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are likewiſe to be evacuated. And therefore (in the very beginning) the firſt waies and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (as we term them) are to be purged and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as for example;</p>

                     <p>If there be preſent any extraordinary ſtore of Blood, that the humors are overhot, it wil then be very requiſite and proper to open a Vein in the Arm. For Nature is wont to expel the vitious humors out of thoſe greater internal Veins unto the external branches, and thoſe that lie under the Skin; which from thence (a Vein being opened) are together with the Blood evacuated.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards (in a moiſt <hi>Scabies</hi> from ſalt Flegm) Preparatives are to be adminiſtred, of Cichory, Agrimony, the Hop, and Maiden-hair; and Purgers of Agarick, Rheubarb, and Sene Leaves.

Afterward let there be dropt thereinto two of three ſpoonfuls of Elder Vinegar; and when the Milk is Curdled, the thin and cleer Whey may be taken in the morning, either alone, or (which is better) with the Syrup of Cichory with Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb.</p>
                     <p>When the Body is ſufficiently purged, then it wil not be amiſs to adminiſter thoſe things that provoke Sweat. As,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>LEpra</hi> (ſo called from the Greek word <hi>Lepis,</hi> in Latine <hi>Squamma,</hi> in regard of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance it hath with the ſcales of fiſhes) is a certain high, or indeed the higheſt degree of <hi>Pſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> or <hi>Scabies.</hi> But now (at the very firſt, and before we proceed any further) leſt that any one ſhould be troubled, and made to doubt in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Authors, it is to be obſerved that we here ſpeak of the <hi>Lepra</hi> of the Grecians, and not that of the Arabians. For that Affect which the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians cal <hi>Lepra,</hi> is the ſame with the Greeks Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantiaſis, touching which we ſhal ſpeak in the next Chapter, which is nothing elſe than an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Cancer of the whol body; as it is manifeſt from the deſcription that is given it by <hi>Avicen</hi> in his <hi>Tertia Quarti,</hi> Tetrab. 3. Chap. 1.) where he ſaith thus: The <hi>Lepra</hi> is a Diſeaſe having its original from black Choler diſperſed throughout the whol body; and from whence the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the parts, the form and figure, and at length alſo the very continuity it ſelf is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and it is a Cancer common to the whol Body.</p>
                  <p>But now again the Arabians cal the <hi>Lepra</hi> with the Greeks, <hi>Albaram nigram,</hi> or the black <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras;</hi> as appeareth out of the ſame <hi>Avicen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Albaras nigra, <hi>or the black</hi> Albaras.</note> in his <hi>Septima Quarti,</hi> Tetrab. 2. Chap. 9. <hi>The black</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baras (ſaith he) <hi>is that very ſame affect that we otherwiſe alſo call</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petigo Excoriativa; <hi>and it is a ſcabbineſs happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto the Skin, rough, vehement; and it maketh ſcales like unto fiſh ſcales, with an itching, and it is accompanied with a melancholy humor, and it is one of thoſe things that precede and go before the Lepra:</hi> By al which words <hi>Lepra</hi> of the Greeks is manifeſtly deſcribed. For why? <hi>Lepra</hi> of the Greeks is a <hi>Scabies</hi> in the higheſt degree, and differeth from the <hi>Scabies</hi> only in the vehemency of the Affect. From whence alſo it is that <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in one and the ſame Chapter, viz. Chap. 2. of his fourth Book, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth both the <hi>Lepra</hi> and the <hi>Scabies:</hi> But <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi> (whom I had rather follow) treateth of them in ſeveral and peculiar Chapters; to wit, of <hi>Scabies,</hi> in the ſeventh Section of his fourth Book, Tetrab. 3. Chap. 6. But he handleth <hi>Lepra</hi> of the Greeks in the place alleadged.</p>
                  <p>For in <hi>Lepra</hi> there is a far greater corruption of the Humors, and conſequently a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper than there is in <hi>Scabies:</hi> and in <hi>Scabies</hi> there fal off only certain bran-like ſubſtances; whereas in the <hi>Lepra</hi> that that fals off reſembleth the ſcales of Fiſhes; ſo that from the itching, by the <hi>Scabies,</hi> there is an eaſie and ready paſſage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Lepra.</hi> For this itching is a certain kind of light roughneſs in the Skin, in the which (unleſs haply it be the more violently ſcratched) there falleth off nothing at al from the Skin. In the <hi>Scabies,</hi> afterward the Humor becometh more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident; and upon the ſcratching there fal off cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain branny bodies. In the <hi>Lepra</hi> the ſwelling is greater; and there fal off no longer certain ſmal branny ſubſtances, but ſcaly bodies, whether there be any ſcratching or not. For in the <hi>Scabies</hi> the matter is more thin, and preyeth upon the higheſt and utmoſt Skin alone: but in <hi>Lepra</hi> the matter is more thick, and therefore doth not only feed upon the utmoſt ſuperficies, but likewiſe upon the deeper parts of the Skin.</p>
                  <p>And without al doubt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Celſus</hi> his Impetigo.</note> 
                     <hi>Celſus</hi> in his fifth Book, and 26. Chap. under the name of <hi>Impetigo</hi> propoundeth and comprehendeth this <hi>Lepra</hi> of the Greeks, and in no wiſe doth he underſtand the Greeks <hi>Lichen</hi> (which by others is called <hi>Impetigo</hi>) when he thus writeth: <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there are of</hi> Impetigo <hi>four ſpecies or kinds; of the which that is leaſt hurtful that in likeneſs repreſenteth the</hi> Scabies. <hi>For it looketh red, and is harder, and is alſo exulcerated, and corrodeth. But it is diſtinguiſhed from the ſaid</hi> Scabies, <hi>becauſe that it is more exulcerated, and hath Puſtules like unto</hi> Vari; <hi>and there ſeem to be in it (as it were) little bubbles or wheals, out of which in proceſs of time ſmal ſcales are reſolved; and this returneth at ſome more certain times.</hi> A <hi>ſecond kind there is worſe than the former, almoſt like unto a</hi> Papula, i. e. <hi>Bliſter or Wheal, but rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and redder than it, and having divers forms. There fal off from the utmoſt Skin ſmal ſcales, the corroſion is greater, its progreſs is ſwifter and broader; and at more certain and ſet times it likewiſe both beginneth and endeth; it is ſirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named</hi> Rubrica. <hi>The third ſort is yet worſe; for it is thicker, and harder, and ſwelleth more; it is alſo cleft in the top of the Skin, and it corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more vehemently. It is alſo in its motion forward ſcaly, but black; and it creepeth afar
<pb n="2496" facs="tcp:49110:52"/> off both ſlowly and broadly. At certain times it either ariſeth or endeth; neither can it be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally taken away, it is ſirnamed the</hi> Black. <hi>The fourth and laſt ſort is that which altogether refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to admit of any Cure, and differing in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: for it is ſomwhat whitiſh, and like unto a new made Cicatrice or Scar, and it hath little pale Scales, and ſome of them are whitiſh, and ſome of them like unto a Pimple, which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away now and then Blood ſloweth forth. But otherwiſe its humor is ſomwhat white, the Skin is hard and cleft, and it proceedeth broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies. Now all theſe kinds do chiefly ariſe in the Feet, and Hands, and they alſo infeſt the Nails. There is not any one Medicament whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever more effectual then what (out of my Author</hi> Protarchus) <hi>I have already related, as appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the</hi> Scabies. <hi>But</hi> Serapion <hi>hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed of Nitre two pugils, and Sulphur four pugils, to be mingled together, and made up into a Maſs with good ſtore of Roſin; and this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy he himſelf likewiſe made uſe of.</hi> Thus <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is there any Author either Greek or Latine that hath made or mentioned ſo many kinds of <hi>Lichenes:</hi> which yet are eaſily found in the <hi>Lepra</hi> of the Greeks; neither do we meet with any one Chapter in <hi>Celſus,</hi> wherein he treateth of <hi>Lepra;</hi> which notwithſtanding although it were unto him unknown, could not poſſibly be ſo unto the moſt ſtudious and knowing <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Moreover, the <hi>Impetigo</hi> is by <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaid to be worſe then even the leaſt and lighteſt <hi>Scabies;</hi> and furthermore <hi>Celſus</hi> writeth that all the kinds of <hi>Impetigo</hi> do ſend forth Scales; which indeed is moſt proper unto <hi>Lepra</hi> of the Greeks; and it is thought likewiſe to have received its name from <hi>Lepis,</hi> that is, a Scale; whereas on the contrary, never any hitherto hath attributed any ſcales whatſoever unto <hi>Lichen</hi> of the Greeks. We now proceed to the Cauſes.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>The Cauſe of this Malady is black Choler. For although there be alſo ſome certain of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents that have aſſerted that <hi>Lepra</hi> likewiſe ariſeth from ſalt Flegm: yet notwithſtandinding this is not ſo to be underſtood as if <hi>Lepra</hi> did ariſe and might be excited from ſalt Flegm alone, but that ſalt Flegm is ſomtimes mingled together with black Choler. And therefore we ſay, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever generateth and heapeth up black Choler, the ſame cauſeth, or at leaſt very much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the breeding and production of <hi>Lepra.</hi> All which have been already made known out of our former diſcourſe touching the <hi>Scabies;</hi> as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, an unfitting Diet, a dry temperament, the Hemorrhoids or monthly Courſes ſuppreſſed, Iſſues ſtopt that had been long kept open and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and a Quartane Feaver. And laſtly, Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on likewiſe maketh very much to the generating of the <hi>Lepra,</hi> in like manner as it do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For if <hi>Scabies</hi> be contagious, then without doubt <hi>Lepra</hi> is ſo likewiſe, it being the worſt <hi>Scabies;</hi> and the truth is, it is moſt agreeable to Reaſon, that the exceſs of the <hi>Scabies</hi> ſhould be more contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the <hi>Scabies</hi> it ſelf.</p>

The Skin (as in the <hi>Scabies</hi>) is rough, dry and withered, there is preſent an itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and there are certain ſubſtances reſembling the Scales of Fiſhes that fall off from them that are affected with it, whether they ſcratch or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſcratching.</p>

                     <p>As for the Cure hereof: Seeing that <hi>Lepra</hi> is a <hi>Scabies</hi> in the higheſt degree, it therefore requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth likewiſe the ſame Medicaments that the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> doth; only they muſt be made ſomwhat ſtronger. Wherefore a good and fitting Diet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordained, the Body is to be evacuated (as hath been ſaid) the diſtemper of the Liver to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and the matter that hath invaded the Skin is by Digeſtives and cleanſing Medicaments to be taken quite away. And in the firſt place, it will not be amiſs here to provoke Sweating with the Decoction of Sarſaparilla, or <hi>Guajacum</hi> Wood. To cleanſe, <hi>Galen</hi> (in his ſixth Book of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſimple Medicaments) doth eſpecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Myrepſick Suppoſitory; which in regard that it hath a very ſtrong aſtringent power, if Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar be therewith joyned, having laid aſide, and put off its aſtringent power and virtue, will excellently well diſcharge the office of Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and deeply penetrating in all affects of the Skin.

                     </gap>herunto are to be referred the changed colours of the Skin. For although in our former Books we propounded the Diſeaſes and Symptoms of the parts ſeverally and aſſunder; yet notwithſtanding it could not here fitly be done, in regard that ſomtimes the ſame Affect (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatneſs of the receſs from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate) is one while a Diſeaſe, and another while a Symptom only.</p>
                  <p>Now unto the word <hi>Vitiligo</hi> (from whence ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be derived) there is no general Greek word to be found that anſwereth unto it; but it conteineth under it theſe three Affects, <hi>Leuce,</hi> and both the <hi>Alphus,</hi> to wit, the white and black. For ſo <hi>Celſus</hi> writeth, in his fifth Book, Chap. 26. about the end thereof. <hi>There are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>three</hi> Species <hi>of</hi> Vitiligo; Alphus <hi>where the white colour is ſomwhat rough, and not continued; ſo that there ſeem to be as it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſmal drops diſperſed. And ſomtimes it cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth broader, and with certain intermiſſions.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las <hi>differeth from this colour, in regard that it is black, and like unto a ſhadow, other things are the ſame.</hi> Leuce <hi>hath ſomwhat like unto</hi> Alphus, <hi>but it is more white, and it deſcendeth deeper, and in it there are white hairs, ſoft and tender as wool or down feathers. All theſe creep, but in ſome faſter, in others more ſlowly.</hi> But <hi>Galen</hi> (as we have already ſaid) hath no common name under which to comprehend <hi>Leuce,</hi> and <hi>Alphus,</hi> but he propoundeth them as divers Affects; in his ſecond Book of the Cauſes of Symptoms and the ſecond Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Arabians</hi> we meet with the word <hi>Albaras,</hi> which they divide into white and black not as one and the ſame Diſeaſe into its Species, but as a word into its ſignifications. For different Affects they are, and <hi>Albaras nigra</hi> or the black <hi>Albaras</hi> is nothing elſe than <hi>Lepra</hi> of the Greeks, and the <hi>Impetigo</hi> of <hi>Celſus.</hi> But <hi>Alba</hi> or the white, the Greeks term <hi>Leuce;</hi> which appellation <hi>Celſus</hi> doth both keep, and maketh it a Species of <hi>Vitiligo.</hi> Like as <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo maketh mention of the white <hi>Vitiligo,</hi> in his Book 18. and Chap. 15. and in his Book 31. Chap. 10. But of <hi>Nigra</hi> or the black, in his Book 22. and Chap. 25. For there is no word or name to be found among the Latines that may anſwer unto the Species of <hi>Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligo,</hi> to wit, <hi>Leuce</hi> and <hi>Alphus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To wit, Phyſitians do thus ſtile <hi>Leuce,,</hi> (as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth in his third Book of the Cauſes of Symptoms, and Chap. 2.) from the Colour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the name thereon. For look what kind of fleſh Locuſts have, and ſo likewiſe almoſt al kind of Oyſters, the like hereunto have they alſo that have their Skins fouled and defiled with <hi>Leuce.</hi> But <hi>Alphoi</hi> are ſo called from the Greek word ſignifying to <hi>change,</hi> to wit, becauſe the colour of the Skin is changed; and yet notwithſtanding not of the whole Skin, but up and down here and there great ſpots ariſe throughout the Skin; and for the moſt part in the Body alſo. And the truth is, their generation (as <hi>Galen</hi> there tels us) is of the like kind, to wit, from a vitious nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment. Yet notwithſtanding under theſe the whol fleſh is not vitiated; but only in the very ſuperficies and top of the Skin there are as it were certain little ſcales faſtened thereupon: and the truth is, that <hi>Alphi</hi> or the white ariſe from a fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, but the black from a melancholly Juyce. And yet they are not true and right ſcales, but there is a certain kind of roughneſs perceived in the Skin, together with the change of colour. For in this the black <hi>Alphus</hi> differeth from the <hi>Lepra</hi> or the black <hi>Albaras</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baras Nigra</hi> or the black <hi>Albaras</hi> there are both excoriation and ſcales, whereas in the black <hi>Alphus</hi> there are neither.</p>

                        <hi>Alphus</hi> is likewiſe called <hi>Morphaea,</hi> without all doubt from <hi>Morphe,</hi> to wit, becauſe the colour of the Skin is changed into white and black, <hi>Celſus</hi> hath uſed the Appellations of the Greeks, in diſtinguiſhing the ſeveral ſpecies of <hi>Vitiligo;</hi> and he hath named the firſt Species <hi>Leuce,</hi> or <hi>Leuca:</hi> but <hi>Alphus</hi> he calleth only by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle name <hi>Alphus;</hi> and the black he ſtileth <hi>Melas.</hi>

                     <p>But now this change of colour (as wel in <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> as in <hi>Alphus</hi>) doth not only conſiſt in the Skin, but is extended likewiſe unto the Hairs; and as <hi>Celſus</hi> in the place alleadged writeth, in <hi>Leuca</hi> there are white Hairs, ſuch as are like unto the
<pb n="2498" facs="tcp:49110:53"/> ſoft and tender Hair in new born Children; and the white <hi>Alphi</hi> likewiſe (as <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> tels us in his fourth Book, and Chap. 6.) produce white Hairs, and the black <hi>Alphi</hi> black Hairs. And <hi>Johannes Philippus Ingraſſias</hi> (in his firſt Tract of Tumors, Chap. 1. P. 142.) aſſureth us, that he had more then once ſeen even old Gray-headed Men that have had ſome part either of their Beards, or of their Eye-brows black, like as it is in young Perſons that are altogether black, to wit, when <hi>Melas</hi> is become inveterate, or that there be preſent the black <hi>Alphus;</hi> and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this while the part affected with the <hi>Leuca</hi> or the inveterate <hi>Alphus,</hi> hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed white.</p>
                     <p>From what hath hitherto been ſaid it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and manifeſt, that by reaſon of the color there is truly an alliance and neer relation between theſe two Affects, <hi>Leuca</hi> and <hi>Alphus;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding in other reſpects they much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the one from the other, ſince that in <hi>Leuce</hi> there is a change not only in the color of the Skin, but of the fleſh likewiſe, yea alſo a change in the very ſubſtance; whereas in <hi>Alphus</hi> only the Skin, or rather indeed the Scarf-skin, is changed in color.</p>

                     <p>For touching the generation of <hi>Leuca, Galen</hi> in his third Book of the Cauſes of Symptoms, and Chap. 2. thus writeth: <hi>When the fleſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath for ſome long time been nouriſhed with blood both flegmatick, and withal glutinous and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the fleſh indeed as yet remaineth, but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its form it changed, and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another ſpecies; and it becometh in a certain mean betwixt fleſh that hath blood, and that that is altogether bloodleſs.

                           </gap>alieth it that for the nutriment that is brought unto it from the reſt of the body, it doth no more ſo much as attempt the converting thereof into the red ſpecies of fleſh, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the likeneſs of the fleſh of Locuſts. And ſo it cometh to paſs, that very ſpeedily it is rendered and becometh both white and flegmatick, and that not only in part, but wholly; in regard that it cannot convert the nutriment into a redneſs, and becauſe that withal that flegmatick humor conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually floweth thereunto.</hi> And therefore what kind of fleſh (even from the beginning) the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts have, (and almoſt al kind of Oyſters) the like (from this tranſmutation) have they that are defiled and fouled with <hi>Leuca.</hi> For ſo they cal this vice of the fleſh, impoſing, to wit, the name from the white color, like as they give the name unto black and callous fleſh from the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</p>
                     <p>But as touching the generating of the <hi>Alphi, Galen</hi> immediately ſubjoyneth, that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them (together with the vices aforeſaid) are of the like kind, but yet ſo notwithſtanding that under them the whol fleſh is not vitiated, but only in the ſuperficies of the body there are as it were certain ſcales fixed and faſtened.</p>
                     <p>But now <hi>Alphus</hi> is twofold; the white that proceedeth from flegm, and by the Arabians it called the white <hi>Morphaea;</hi> and the black that it generated from a melancholy humor, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the black <hi>Morphaea.</hi> But yet notwithſtanding ſome there are that conſtitute other colors alſo; and they ſay that the Skin is ſomtimes changed unto a citrine yellowiſh color, and ſomtimes likewiſe unto a red, according unto the diverſity of the corrupt humor.

                  <p>WE have already told you above in the 28. Chapter, That <hi>Celſus</hi> his <hi>Impeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>Lepra</hi> of the Greeks. But now the <hi>Impetigo</hi> of <hi>Pliny,</hi> and that we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe meet with in divers others of the Latins (and of which it is our putpoſe here in this Chapter to treat) is the ſame that the Greeks cal <hi>Lichen.</hi>

And this happeneth more eſpecially in the ſpring time; whereupon it is, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in the third Book of his Aphoriſms, Aphor. 20.) reckoneth up <hi>Lichenes</hi> among the Diſeaſes of the Spring.

And ſomtimes theſe Tubercles get a growth and increaſe, in ſo much that the Face becometh une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and frightful to look upon, and the Noſe augmented unto an extraordinary bigneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. There lived a yeer or two ago (not far from <hi>Dreſda</hi>) a man affected with this Malady, whole Noſe grew to ſuch a vaſt greatneſs, that it hindred him in his reading; which Malady brought him to that paſs, that in the yeer 1629. he was content to have ſome certain parts and ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of his Noſe pared away and quite cut off.</p>

                     <hi>Nicholaus Florentinus</hi> Serm. 7. Tetrab. 6. Summ. 2.

Now this diſtemper happeneth unto ſome through a default and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs in their Natural Conſtitution; and theſe let them live never ſo ſoberly and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, yet notwithſtanding they are nevertheleſs ſubject and liable unto this Affect. But however for the moſt part this evil is contracted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by ſuch perſons as are addicted to the pot, and given over to drunkenneſs and ſwilling; and they are not only thoſe that are exceſſive drinkers of Wine, but likewiſe ſuch as exceed in drinking of Beer: and I once knew a Student that was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly affected with this Malady, and he had gotten a moſt foul and deformed Face. This man travelling afterwards into <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France</hi> (where there is not that plenty of Beer) at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home again was much the better, and far leſs afflicted with the aforeſaid Malady than formerly he had been. For Beer is much thicker than Wine, and therfore it alſo breedeth and ſupplieth a more thick and groſs blood.</p>

                     <p>This Malady is very hardly cured, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Face be ful of Puſtules, and as it were exulcerated; and for the moſt part it accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the perſon that hath it ſo long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>

                     <p>Now this Affect is not any other way to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but by taking away the fault of the blood, and what is amiſs in the Liver. For albeit that the containing cauſe (as we cal it) of this Malady may be diſſipated in the Face; yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it wil not be long ere there be made a new and freſh ſupply of the ſame matter. And therefore there muſt not only be an evacuation of the blood and the cholerick humor (which for the moſt part is mingled together with the blood) and Cupping-glaſſes with ſcarification oftentimes faſtened and affixed unto the Shoulder-blades; but eſpecially and in the firſt place, the extream heat of the blood and liver is to be brought unto a due and fit temper, and the obſtructions of the Liver are to be opened; touching which we have ſufficiently ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, in the third Book of our Practice, Part 6. Sect. 1. Chap. 1. touching the hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Liver, and there likewiſe, Chap. 2. of the obſtruction of the Liver. Thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are made and provided of Strawberries, Cichory, and whatſoever Compoſitions that have in them any of the ſaid Cichory, are here moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and proper.</p>
                     <p>As for Topical Remedies, let them be cooling, when the Face is only red, and not yet defiled with Puſtules; but if with the redneſs there be alſo Puſtules accompanying it, then the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought likewiſe to be ſuch as have in them a power and vertue to diſcuſs.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Remedies are adminiſtred in the form of Waters and Liquors, as alſo of Liniments and Unguents. As firſt thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the Root of Solomons Seal three ounces; Flowers of Elder, of the Valley Lilly, of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Muſhroms, of each ſix ounces; white Tartar an ounce and half; white Wine a pottle; Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire two drams. Let them ſtand infuſing in the Wine ten daies, and afterward deſtil them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Wheaten Meal as much as you think fit, Goats Milk one quart; make hereof Dough, and making it into Loaves bake them in the Oven; and let this Bread be again macerated in Goats Milk for the ſpace of twelve hours. After this add the Whites of twenty Eggs, Camphyre one ounce; burnt Allum two ounces; Deſtil them, and make a Water. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Strawberries a pint, Goats Milk a quart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Whites of twenty Eggs, the Seed of Quinces two ounces, Camphyre two drams, Allum and Sulphur, of each half an ounce; mingle and deſtil them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lac Virginis</hi> (as they cal it) is likewiſe very good for this purpoſe, made of one part of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge, and three of Vinegar. But this following is more efficacious:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Litharge half an ounce; Vinegar four ounces; let them boyl to the conſumption of the third part; and in another Pot boyl of Salt and Allum, of each half a dram; Frankincenſe one ſcruple; Roſe water half a pint: Mingle both theſe Liquors, and paſs them through a Linen ſtrainer; and keep it for your uſe. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Sulphur two drams; common Salt, and Camphyre, of each half a dram; Ceruſs, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge of Silver, of each two drams; make them into a Pouder, and then mingle them carefully with the Water of Bean flowers, Roſe water, white Lilly Water, the Water of Solomons Seal, of each two ounces: Mingle them, &amp;c. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Camphyre one dram; pour unto it into the Mortar by a little at once, and ſtirring it wel

                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Litharge one ounce; Allum three drams; Ceruſs half an ounce; Vinegar two ounces; the Water of Roſes, and Plantane, of each four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; boyl them until a third part be waſted away, then ſtrain them; and to the ſtraining add a little of the Juyce of Lemmons; and with this mixture let the Face be anointed in the Evening. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the Kernels of Peaches clean peeled, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Almonds blanched, of each in number ſix; beat them wel in a Mortar with a little milk; and then let their milky Juyce be preſſed forth; unto which add of burnt Allum as much as a Nut. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward take of Quick-ſilver as much as a great Peaſe in quantity; which together with Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhake wel, and ſtir it about in the Mortar until it become black, and be as it were mortified; and then mingle it carefully with the former Liquor, with which about bed-time let the Face be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and then in the morning following let it be waſhed with Roſe water, or the Water of Bean flour. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the whiteſt Tartar, Allum, and Nitre, of each four parts; Sulphur one part; bruiſe them wel, and then Calcine them; and in a Cellar from them make an Oyl <hi>per deliquium</hi> (as they ſpeak) or by draining. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Kernels of Peaches hulled four ounces; the ſeed of Gourds peeled two ounces; let them be bruiſed, and then the Oyl preſſed out of them; with which let the Face be wel anointed both morning and evening, and afterward waſhed with Roſe water, and Bean flour Water, and the Water of Solomons Seal. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Camphyre, Litharge, burnt Allum, of each half a dram; live Sulphur a dram and half; White Vitriol, and Frankincenſe, of each one dram; let them be poudered, and carefully min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Roſe water, and Bean flour Water. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Live Sulphur one ounce; Choice Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe three drams; Myrrh two drams; Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire one dram; Ceruſs half a dram; Pouder them al very ſmal, and pour thereto of Roſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one pint, mingle them; and when the Patient goes into his Bed let his Face be anointed with the ſaid Liquor; and the morning following let it be waſhed with the water of the infuſion of Bran. Or,</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> one whol Egg, and put it into the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Vinegar for four daies, until the ſhel be ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened; afterward take forth the white, and fill it up with Frankincenſe, Maſtick, and Ceruſs, of each one dram; mingle them, &amp;c.</p>

And moreover, as for what concerneth the Affects here propounded, what we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by <hi>Cruſta Lactea,</hi> and what we mean by <hi>Achores, Favi,</hi> and <hi>Tinea,</hi> we have already told you in the place before alleadged: as for <hi>Helcydria, Pſydracia,</hi> and other the like Affects of the Head (comprehended under the general name <hi>Exanthemata</hi>) they are al together hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Galen</hi> in his firſt Book of the Compoſition of Medicaments, according to the places affected, and the laſt Chap. but by the reſt of the Greeks in divers and diſtinct Chapters. <hi>Halyabbas</hi> ſeems to comprehend them al under the name of <hi>Tinea,</hi> whenas in the eighth Book of his Theory, and Chap. 18. he thus writeth: <hi>But theſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> Tineae (ſaith he) <hi>are very ſmal, and they happen unto the Head; and there is in them a bladder that hath many ſpecies and kinds. The firſt whereof is that we cal</hi> Favoſa, <hi>which hath its original from a ſalt flegm: the ſign whereof is this, That there is an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer whereby the Skin of the Head is perforated, and ful of little holes,

From whence it is that <hi>Celſus</hi> (in his ſixth Book, and Chap. 3.) conſtituteth two ſpecies thereof; where he thus writeth: <hi>There is likewiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, that from the likeneſs it hath with a Fig<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is by the Greeks named</hi> Sycoſis. <hi>And here the fleſh groweth forth; and this is indeed the general name thereof. But now under it there are two ſpecies: the one whereof is an hard and round <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer; but the other moiſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal. Out of the hard there floweth forth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is ſmal and glutinous; but out of the moiſt there iſſueth forth more, and that of a very ill ſavor. Now both theſe are in thoſe parts that are covered with Hair. But then indeed that which is callous and round breaketh forth more eſpecially in the Beard; whereas (on the other ſide) that which is moiſt appeareth chiefly in the Hair. It is bred likewiſe in the Arſe; and then the Latines cal it</hi> Mariſca.</p>

                     </gap> her ſo only, but likewiſe there is great variety of difference that occurreth in explaining the cauſe thereof. For <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of preternatural Tumors, and Chap. 16. aſſerteth that a ſalt flegm; but in his firſt Book of the Compoſition of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments according to the places, Chap. 10. he ſaith that a humor mingled of a thin, wheyiſh, and corroding, and likewiſe of a thick, glutinous, and clammy juyce, is the cauſe as wel of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chores,</hi> as of <hi>Favi. Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his third Book, and Chap. 3. writeth that a nitrous and ſalt flegm is the cauſe of both theſe Affects. <hi>Alexander</hi> in his firſt Book, and Chap. 8. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth three Humors, viz. Choler, Flegm, and the Melancholy Humor. And indeed the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of the whol Controverſie is this; That theſe Affects do ariſe from a Salt and nitrous flegm, with the which there is mingled one while Choler, another while Blood, and ſomtimes likewiſe a Melancholy Humor.</p>

                     <p>Take <hi>the Spume or Froth of Silver, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſs, of each half an ounce; Alum, and the Leaves of Green Rue, of each two drams; theſe being well bruiſed and mingled together with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Oyl, anoynt the part affected therewith.</hi> Or,</p>

                  <p>THere is moreover another kind of Tumor, which is not excited ſimply from a humor poured forth into the external parts of the Body or diffuſed through them; but a humor in which the matter that is the cauſe of the Tumor is (in a peculiar Membrane) concluded and ſhut up; and the humor that exciteth this kind of Tumor is changed into almoſt another kind of Subſtance. Among theſe Tumors, in the firſt place we are to account <hi>Strumae</hi> and <hi>Scrofulae:</hi> and indeed tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Strumae</hi> in the Neck (or the Kings Evil, as we commonly call it) and <hi>Bronchocele,</hi> we have already treated, in the ſecond Book of our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, Part 1. Chap. 25. where we have likewiſe written much of <hi>Stumae</hi> in general. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, here in this place likewiſe there is ſomthing more in general to be ſpoken touching the ſame; in regard that (as we ſhall by and by ſhew you) they do not only ſeiz upon the Neck, but alſo upon divers other parts.</p>
                  <p>But although this kind of Tumor may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly be referred unto a <hi>Scirrhus;</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanding they are not called by this common name; but theſe Tumors are called <hi>Choirades,</hi> or <hi>Scrofulae;</hi> the appellations being taken from Swine, that are more frequently troubled with this Malady. And yet notwithſtanding <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his ſixth Book, and Chap. 35. ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth another reaſon of the name, to wit, from the Rocks <hi>Chaerades:</hi> For <hi>Chaeras</hi> is a black Rock in the Sea, that is rough and ſomewhat eminent, ſo that it ſeemeth like unto a ſwimming Hog: unto which Rock indeed (by reaſon of the roughneſs of the Tumor) this Diſeaſe may be reſembled. But yet ſome there are that ſeem to make a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt <hi>Scrofulae</hi> and <hi>Strumae,</hi> when they write that <hi>Scrofulae</hi> are hardned Tumors, and ſuch as are included within a certain Membrane in the Glandules or kernelly parts; the which if they be generated out of the Fleſh, then they are to be called <hi>Strumae;</hi> but moſt Phyſitians reject and approve not of this difference. For <hi>Strumae</hi> are a Scirrhous Tumor of the Glandules,<note place="margin">VVhat <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae</hi> are.</note> as <hi>Galen</hi> defineth it in his 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 11. and ſuch as is ſhut up in a peculiar Membrane. For the Glandules or Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels are the Subject of <hi>Strumae;</hi> and the truth is they ariſe moſt commonly in the Neck (both the fore part and the hinder part thereof) and yet ſomtimes likewiſe in the Arm-holes, and the Groins. <hi>Meges</hi> a certain Chirurgeon (of whom <hi>Galen</hi> alſo maketh mention in his Book of the Method of Phyſick, the laſt Chapter) hath alſo obſerved that, theſe <hi>Strumae</hi> often ariſe in the Paps, as <hi>Celſus</hi> writeth in the fifth Book, Chap. 18. And we have told you before in the third Book of our Practiſe, Part 3. and Chap. 5. that <hi>Strumae</hi> have been likewiſe ſomtimes found in the Meſenterium. If this Affect appear in the Throat then by a peculiar name they call it <hi>Bronchocele, Bocius,</hi> and <hi>Hernia Gutturalis.</hi> This is a great and round Tumor of the Neck, between the Skin and the rough Artery; in the which there is included ſomtimes Fleſh, and another while a certain humor like unto Honey or Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. But yet notwithſtanding theſe <hi>Scrofulae</hi> differ from other Glandulous Tumors; and that firſt in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe that in <hi>Scrofulae</hi> there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kernels that ſwel up; and one dependeth upon the other in the ſuperficies of the Skin, like unto Grapes that hang down from one and the ſame Bough; and moreover, becauſe that <hi>Scroful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>But now theſe <hi>Strumae</hi> have their original from a flegmy humor, and likewiſe (according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) from a Melancholly, or elſe from a humor mingled of Flegm and Melancholly: whereupon it is that ſuch as are Flegmatick, Melancholly, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinous, that are wont to eat meats that are cold &amp; moiſt, and to drink cold waters, are moſt eſpecially troubled with theſe <hi>Scrofulae.</hi> And hence it is that in certain Regions where the Inhabitants make uſe of Crude and ſnowy waters, they are all of them for the moſt part afflicted with the ſaid <hi>Strumae.</hi> But now theſe <hi>Strumae</hi> are generated, not ſuddenly, and all at once, but by degrees, one after another; and firſt of all the matter floweth in unto one Glandule, in the which there is excited a Tumor,
<pb n="2507" facs="tcp:49110:57"/> ſoft and looſe; and then unto another, in which there is in like manner excited a ſoft Tumor, which in a ſhort time is hardened; until at the length there hang down from the place affected many Glandules, as it were ſo many Boughs or Branches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aetius</hi> in Tetrab. 4. Serm. 3. Chap. 5. out of <hi>Leonidas,</hi> tels us of a twofold manner of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of theſe <hi>Strumae,</hi> where he thus writes: <hi>Theſe</hi> Strumae (ſaith he) <hi>are a Fleſh ſomwhat white, eaſily encreaſing and growing, conteined in a Membrane; and in brief, they are Glandules hardned, that ariſe in the Neck, under the Arms, and in the Groyns, where the Glandules are ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated under the Veſſels, like as alſo in other Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules already mentioned. And ſomtimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (but this is very rare) they are bred from the Fleſh of the ſelf ſame places, which by a certain affinity is converted into the nature of</hi> Strumae, <hi>and is augmented by the acceſs of Matter.</hi> For firſt of all, the Glandules of the ſaid parts (in like manner as all other parts, the Flegm being dried, or the Melancholly humor, or both of them together mingled) become hard like as a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> doth. But ſomtimes the very ſubſtance of the Glandulous fleſh being dried waxeth hard; which yet notwithſtanding being afterward moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened by the melancholly or Flegmy humor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, and becometh preternaturally augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Yet notwitſtanding, in regard that both thoſe waies of generation are coincident, and in a manner one and the ſame, <hi>Galen</hi> thereupon ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the moſt part to ſleight this difference, and in his Book of preternatural Tumors, Chap. 11. he there ſaith, that ſuch as are affected with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened Glandules may properly be ſaid to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with <hi>Strumae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet notwithſtanding touching the Cauſes, we have before in the place alleadged acquainted you, that <hi>Platerus</hi> determineth, that Flegm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and the Melancholly humor, are ſcarcely ſufficient to generate <hi>Strumae,</hi> ſeeing that if they were from thoſe alone, they would not then be of long continuance, but they would rather be obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious unto putridneſs or turned into <hi>Pus,</hi> like as are other Tumors; but that theſe <hi>Strumae</hi> derive their original from a Juyce nouriſhing theſe parts. For whereas Glandules are nouriſhed with a thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Juyce than other fleſhly parts; if this Juyce exceed in Quantity, it then generateth divers kind of Tumors. But although this be altogether to be granted; yet notwithſtanding this is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impoſſible, but that ſome melancholly and flegmy humor be mingled together with the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Glandules.</p>
                     <p>Now this matter of the <hi>Strumae</hi> is included in a peculiar Membrane, which the formative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (that is ſeated and planted in all the parts that have life in them) produceth. For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is ſome Membrane diſtended, or even bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, by the ſuperfluous humor that floweth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Nature extendeth and dilateth the ſame; and attempteth) the ſtructure and forming as it were of a new Membrane.</p>

                     <p>Theſe <hi>Strumae</hi> are by ſome diſtinguiſhed into Malignant and Benign; and they will have thoſe to be benign that are without an Inflammation, &amp; without pain; and thoſe they will have to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant that have with them both Inflammation and pain, and that are the more exaſperated by Medicaments.

                     <hi>GAnglion,</hi> ſo called by the Greeks, and by the Latines <hi>Ganglium,</hi> is by ſome reckoned up among the Affects of the Head. But by <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his fourth Book, Chap. 16. and Book 6. Chap. 39. and by <hi>Aetius</hi> in <hi>Tetrab.</hi> 4. Serm. 3. Chap. 9. it is attributed unto many parts, and it is an Affect of the Nervous parts; and by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Phyſical Definitions it is thus defined, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a preternatural rowling together, or knot of a Nerve, which groweth together into one Body. The very ſame Tumor <hi>Guido</hi> in his ſecond Tract, Doct. 2. Chap. 4. ſeemeth to call it <hi>Lupia;</hi> and <hi>Tagautius</hi> in his Chirurgicall Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, Book 1. Chap. 13. writeth, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in <hi>Aetius</hi> (out of the Cure <hi>Philagrius</hi>) that <hi>Lupia</hi> of the modern Phyſitians, the <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula</hi> of <hi>Avicen,</hi> and <hi>Ganglion</hi> of the Greeks, is one and the ſame Affect.</p>
                  <p>But by what names theſe Tumors are called by the Germans is not very evident. For if we wel weigh the Deſcriptions, and Signs, yea and the Cure likewiſe of <hi>Ganglion,</hi> and <hi>Lupia</hi> of the Greeks, and the latter Phyſitians, as alſo of the
<pb n="2508" facs="tcp:49110:58"/> Glandules of <hi>Avicen, Ganglium</hi> is that Affect which by the Germans is called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>berbein,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">uberbein.</note> ſo called, not that it is indeed a Bone, but becauſe it is a Tumor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Bone, to wit, in that ſame place where the Bones are only covered with the Skin, or becauſe it reſembleth the hardneſs of a Bone. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Platerus</hi> doth not cal thoſe Tumors that ariſe from the Nerves (and which Authors every where deſcribe under the name of <hi>Ganglium</hi>) by the name of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>berbeine,</hi> but a peculiar kind of Tumor, when (the <hi>Perioſtium</hi> being ſhaven, or eaten through) there ſpringeth up, and groweth unto the former as it were a new Bone. But now that Tumor which he propoundeth under the name of <hi>Ganglium,</hi> viz. which is bred about the joynts, eſpecially the Knees, ſomtimes compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the whol Joynt (and this one while in a more narrow, and other while in a broader limit, and ſomtimes alſo ſo ſtopping and hindering the motion thereof that the Member is altogether either motionleſs, or elſe ſo that it cannot be wholly and entirely moved) ſeemeth to be that Tumor which the Germans cal <hi>Glied-ſhevva;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Glied-ſhevva.</note> to wit, becauſe (as it were a certain Muſhrom) it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth under the Skin, neer about the Joynts, and eſpecially the Knee, which is not alwaies round, but often overſpreadeth the whol Knee; when yet notwithſtanding <hi>Ganglion</hi> is alwaies a round Tumor, as <hi>Ambroſe Parrey</hi> writeth in his ſixth Book, and Chap. 20.</p>
                  <p>But (as I told you likewiſe before) there is a great confuſion in the names. And therefore (as <hi>Joh. Tagautius</hi> in the firſt Book of his Phyſical Inſtitutions, and Chap. 2. adviſeth us) the thing it ſelf is to be heeded with al care and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and as for the names, we need not much to regard them; ſince that oftentimes one and the ſame word hath in ſeveral Authors various and different appellations. <hi>Ganglion</hi> ariſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in al, or the moſt parts of the body, (and yet more eſpecially in thoſe parts that are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) neer about the Joynts, to wit, In the Hands and Feet, and in thoſe very places where the Bones are only covered with Skin, and where there is a concourſe of the Tendons, Ligaments, and Nerves. And yet notwithſtanding <hi>Aetius</hi> addeth the Head and Forehead, as likewiſe the Elbows and Arms; but it is but ſeldom that it happeneth in theſe parts.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>That it hath its original from a blow, or from hard labor, <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> teach us; which is indeed to be underſtood of the evident cauſe. But how theſe evident cauſes come to produce thoſe Tumors, is not ſo evident and manifeſt. Vulgarly, the greater part determine that they ariſe from a dull, ſluggiſh, thick flegm, or elſe from Melancholy. But others aſſert (and that more rightly) that by means of ſome fal, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of extenſion, or of ſome extraordinary hard labor, and over working, (by al or any of which either a Nerve or a Tendon is too far extended, or likewiſe, according to the Membrane, even as is were broken) the nutriment of the Nervous part doth as it were ſweat forth, and adhere neer about the Fibres and the ſubſtance of the ſame Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous part, and ſo becometh changed into this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by reaſon of the formative faculty of the ſaid parts, and then covered with a peculiar Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane. After which manner (if the <hi>Perioſtium</hi> be opened) even in the Bones, their nutriment is turned into a boney knot, as <hi>Platerus</hi> giveth us to underſtand. For look as it is in Trees, if their Rind or Bark be wounded, or in any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner opened, Nature ſweating forth the aliment ſuffereth it not raſhly to diffuſe it ſelf al abroad, but changeth it into a knot; ſo in like manner, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Membranes that wrap about the Bones or Nervous parts may be broken, yet Nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not the aliment raſhly to flow abroad through the open paſſages, but from thence (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Skin) formeth a Tumor, included and ſhut up in a peculiar Membrane.</p>
                     <p>But now that <hi>Ganglion</hi> that <hi>Platerus</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth happeneth not from the default of one only Nerve or Tendon, but chiefly in thoſe places where there is a concourſe of Tendons, Ligaments, and Nerves; and eſpecially about the knee, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when thoſe parts by reaſon of their overgreat motion are very much exerciſed, or elſe while Wounds are in curing. For if the juyce of theſe parts, to wit, of the Tendons, Nerves, Membranes, and Ligaments, ſhal chance (upon the occaſion of the aforeſaid Cauſes) to flow forth abroad out of the ſaid parts, and ſhal withal begin to be lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant, and to abound, and ſhal likewiſe adhere unto the Fibres of the ſame parts, it is then chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into ſuch a like fungous or Muſhrom-like matter, which oftentimes overſpreadeth the whol joynt; and is thereupon by the Germans called <hi>Der Gliedſhevva.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet notwithſtanding it may likewiſe ſo chance, that a vitious humor abounding in the body may flow in into ſuch a like weak part, and may be mingled together with the ſaid thick juyce that nouriſheth theſe parts, and may (through that open paſſage) flow together with it unto the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid parts, and may there augment the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</p>

And therefore the Tumor is to be rubbed with the hand ſo long until it wax hot, and become ſofter, and afterward let it be cloſe preſſed together with ſome thin plate, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolid thing, ſo long that the bladder may be broken, and that the matter therein included may be thereby diſperſed.

                        <hi>Take</hi> of the Emplaſter Oxycroceum one ounce; the Mucilage of Marſh-mallow ſeed, and Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek ſeed, of each half an ounce; Galbanum, Sagapenum, and Ammoniacum diſſolved in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, of each three drams; Roſin ſix drams; white Wax half an ounce; Mingle them, and make an Emplaſter.

                     <p>If the <hi>Ganglia</hi> give not way unto theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, we muſt then betake our ſelves unto thoſe Remedies that cauſe ſuppuration. As for Example:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the Roots of white Lillies, and Marſh-mallow Roots, of each an ounce and half; the Root of Fern one ounce; fat dried Figs, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ten; the Root of Squils (or the Sea Onion) one ounce; the Flowers of Melilote, and Elder flowers, of each one ſmal handful; boyl them in the Broth of a Wether-Sheeps Feet, adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſmal quantity of Vinegar. Afterward let them be wel bruiſed together, and then paſs them through a hair ſieve, and then add, of Wheat flour, and the flour of Lupines, of each half an ounce; the fat of an old Sow, Ducks fat, and Gooſe fat, of each two ounces; the Dregs or Lees of the Oyl of white Lillies three ounces; and ſo make a Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ganglia</hi> and <hi>Nodi</hi> may likewiſe be taken away by Section;<note place="margin">Section.</note> ſuch alone of them that conſiſt in the Head, the Forehead, and other places without the Joynts. But thoſe of them that conſiſt in the Joynts are not ſafely to be cut, there being cauſe to fear leſt that the Nervous parts that lie underneath be hurt thereby, and ſo conſequently the motion of the Member quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. As (in like manner) it is not fit to cut thoſe <hi>Ganglia</hi> that are neer about the Jugular Veins, for fear of an Hemorrhage or flux of blood. Now for the manner of Section, it is this; Firſt of al, there muſt be made a ſmal Wound in the Skin, even unto the bladder wherein the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Tumor is included; through which a Probe of the thickneſs of a finger, and round at the end, but hollow in the midſt, is to be conveyed in betwixt the Skin and the bladder, and then to be drawn about even unto the very Root of the <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glium:</hi> and then after this (upon it) the Skin is to have an Inciſion made therein deep enough, in the form of the letter X; and from the corner of the Bladder it is to be drawn along towards the Root: and if there ariſe any Hemorrhage from
<pb n="2510" facs="tcp:49110:59"/> the thicker Veſſels upon their being cut about the Root, it is in a fit and convenient manner to be ſtanched and ſtopt; and then upon this the whol Tumor (together with the Membrane) is to be extracted and drawn forth, and no part thereof to be left remaining behind; or if haply there ſhould be any thereof left behind, it is then to be conſumed with Cauſtick Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>Callous or Boney <hi>Nodi</hi> (by <hi>Platerus</hi> ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſpecial) are hardly cured, and not at al, if they be inve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here likewiſe thoſe Cataplaſms are very uſeful that are made of <hi>Mandrake</hi> Root, the Leaves of Hemlock, Henbane, the dead Nettle, boyled in Vinegar, and mingled together with Emollient Greaſes.</p>
                     <p>If theſe <hi>Nodi</hi> tend towards the Joynts, and ſo hinder their motion, and have their abode in thoſe places that are naked, and only covered with the Bones, then the Skin is to be opened; and with a ſharp Iron the <hi>Nodus</hi> (by a continued ſtroke) is to be cut away from the Bone; and the Wound is then to be cured in a fit and convenient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ganglia</hi> in ſpecial ſo called (or thoſe Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom-like ſpungy Tumors that ariſe about the Joynts, and eſpecially the Knees, ſomtimes whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehending it, and hindering its motion) are not to be cured without much difficulty. For Section (in regard that it cannot be adminiſtred without hurting the Tendons, Ligaments, and Nerves) hath here no place. And therefore we ought to aſſay that by Emollients and Digeſtives they may be diſcuſſed: but yet notwithſtanding we ought evermore to beware that there follow not any ſuppuration hereupon, which in theſe places is wont to excite incurable Ulcers, by which the Nervous parts neer about the Joynts are corrupted.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe the Medicaments before propounded are likewiſe very uſeful and profitable. Or elſe let a Fomentation be provided of the Roots of Marſh-mallows, white Lillies, Briony, the wild Cucumber, Sowbread, the Leaves of Mallows, Marſh-mallows, dead Nettle, Henbane, Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, Sage, Primroſe, the flowers of Camomile, Elder, Wall-flowers, Melilote, Linſeed, Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek ſeed, Bayberries.

                  <p>THeſe kind of Tumors have this one thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar unto them, to wit, That the matter that is contained in them is ſhut up in a peculiar Tunicle, or little Bladder. And they take their name from the matter contained in them. For if the matter that is ſhut up within be like unto Honey, it is then called <hi>Meliceris,</hi> (and the Latines uſually cal it <hi>Mellifavium;</hi>) if it be like to Frumenty (which the Greeks term <hi>Atheria</hi>) we then cal it <hi>Atheroma;</hi> and laſtly, if it be like unto Suet, it is then by the moſt called <hi>Steatoma.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Meliceris what it is.</note> For <hi>Melice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> (as it appeareth out of <hi>Galen</hi> in his fourteenth Book of the Method of Phyſick, and Chap. 6. and out of <hi>Aetius,</hi> Tetrab. 4. Serm. 3. Chap. 7. as alſo out of <hi>Paulus Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta,</hi> in his ſixth Book, Chap. 36. and laſtly, out of <hi>Celſus</hi> in his ſeventh Book, and Chap. 6.) is a Tumor without pain, containing a matter like unto Honey that is ſhut up in a little Nervous Skin.<note place="margin">Atheroma what it is:</note> But <hi>Athero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> is a Tumor without any pain, containing in a Nervous Tunicle a Humor like unto Prumenty, or a Pultiſs.<note place="margin">ſteatoma what it is:</note> And <hi>Steatoma</hi> is in like manner a Tumor containing within a peculiar Membrane a Humor like unto Suet.</p>
                  <p>But now touching <hi>Meliceris,</hi> it is here to be noted, That it is a Diſeaſe not one and the ſame with <hi>Meliceria</hi> (of which <hi>Aetius</hi> maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his fifth Book, and Chap. 28.) but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe different from it. For <hi>Meliceria</hi> (as <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> himſelf hath it) is a kind of Ulcer, that is ſo called from the reſemblance it hath with a Bee-hive; which ſaid Diſeaſe we have already explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſecund part, and Chap. 3. of Infants Diſeaſes, and by others it is likewiſe called <hi>Kerion, Favus</hi> or Bee-hive; and it is an Ulcer that is very ful of holes, chiefly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar unto the Head, pouring forth at thoſe holes a corrupt matter like unto Honey; and it hath its original from flegm that is ſalt or nitrous. But <hi>Meliceris</hi> (touching which we are here treating) without any hole at al, in whatſoever part of the body it happeneth to be, it containeth within under a Nervous Membrane a ſubſtance like unto Honey.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>Now all theſe Tumors are referred unto the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous or Flegmy, and they are vulgarly ſaid to
<pb n="2511" facs="tcp:49110:59"/> be excited from a Pituitous or Flegmy humor, which in progreſs of time is by degrees and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed into a Matter that is ſomtimes like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Honey, ſomtimes unto Frumenty, and now and then likewiſe reſembling Suet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Platerus</hi> (as we alſo before told you, in the ſecond Book of our Practiſe, Part 1. Chap. 25. where we treated of <hi>Strumae</hi>) hath a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Opinion by himſelf touching the Cauſes of theſe Tumors. For he thinketh that theſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Tumors are generated from excrementitious humors (for if any ſuch thing ſhould be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of theſe kind of excrements, he conceiveth that it could not be ſo ſtable and firm, but that it would rather be obnoxious to putridneſs and corruption) but from an alimentary Juyce, to wit, ſuch as is by Nature ordained for the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the part. For if the humor be thicker than is convenient for the nouriſhing of a fl ſhy part, then (ſaith he) a harder ſort of Tumors then are the <hi>Sarcomata</hi> are ſomtimes produced; and again, if this humor be extraordinary thick, then a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is generated. But if the Tumor be not ſo hard, then in a ſhort time it endeth in an Impoſtume, in the which there may be generated a different matter, according to the difference and Variety of this Juyce that hath bred this Tumor, &amp; the mingling therof with other humors; which yet notwithſtanding is not ſuppurated in like manner as other Impoſtumes are that are bred from the Blood; neither is it turned into <hi>Pus,</hi> but into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind of ſubſtance that is included in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Membrane, or Bladder. And in this manner (as he writeth) are generated <hi>Melicerides, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romata,</hi> and <hi>Steatomata.</hi> But he addeth likewiſe that unto the generation of ſuch like Tumors as theſe this conduceth very much, to wit, if toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this Juyce that ought to nouriſh the fleſh, a portion of that Nutriment of ſome other part (that ought to be nouriſhed by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thick Juyce) departing from it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried into the fleſhy ſeats together with their Nutriment, there beget in them ſuch an hardneſs. And this he likewiſe endeavoreth to prove even by this Argument, to wit, that in theſe kind of Impoſtumes bred from thoſe Tumors there is to be found ſomthing like unto the ſubſtance of other parts reſembling ſomtimes Hair, ſomtimes a Nail, ſometimes a Bone, and now and then a Glandule; which (ſaith he) could not wel any otherwiſe be bred, or produced from any thing elſe then the juyce nouriſhing theſe parts, either in the Skin, or in the fleſh neer unto it, as being hither brought &amp; conveyed together with the proper Nutriment of the Fleſh. And from the ſame he conceiveth that it cometh to paſs, if at any time there be found in an Impoſtume any thing that reſembleth a Bee-hive, a Pultiſe, or Honey; that this proceedeth from the fatter part of the Blood, that cauſeth a fatneſs; and this indeed he conceiveth to be from the fleſhy Juyce that is not as yet converted into <hi>Pus,</hi> but by maturation by means of the heat boyled as it were and hardened into ſuch a tenacious humor; the which if it be any further torrified, inſomuch that this Juyce become more earthy, then it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth ſomthing elſe, as Coals, ſmal Stones, or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and the like. Theſe things if they be in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar Membrane, then (as he writeth) theſe alſo are bred from a Membranous Juyce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from hence.</p>
                     <p>But now, as touching this Opinion, there are certain things to be taken notice of. For firſt of al, it doth not yet from hence appear, what the cauſe is why ſuch like tumors as theſe are not bred in al bodies, neither yet in all parts, out of that Juyce by wh ch they are nouriſhed. And hereupon, the Cauſe that is to be rendred why that humor fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>weth out of the parts, and that thereupon a Tumor is excited under the Skin, I conceive to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>his, that the Membrane that covereth any part whatſoever, and encompaſſeth it, is (either by ſome external and violent, or elſe by ſome internal Cauſe) either broken or corroded and eaten quite through, and exulcerated (which in the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Nodi</hi> or knots in the Bones, <hi>Platerus</hi> granteth that it may ſo happen in the <hi>Perioſtium</hi>) ſo that the way and paſſage being opened, the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or nouriſhing Juyce flowing forth is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger kept in and ſhut up in the part affect d, but that it ſweateth forth through this open paſſage. Which yet notwithſtanding Nature that is never idle permitteth not raſhly to be done; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth further to extend the very Membrane it ſelf, and to ſhut up the Juyce flowing forth; like as we ſee it to be done in Trees where (the external B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>k being cut) there is in the very like manner a <hi>Nodus</hi> or knot formed. And moreover, that the Juyce which affordeth matter unto the Tumor is chiefly deſtined and ordeined for the nouriſhing of the part, this I wil readily grant; but yet <hi>Platerus</hi> himſelf cannot deny but that in progreſs of time vitious humors may be likewiſe driven forth thither. Neither is it requiſite that it ſhould be immediately converted into <hi>Pus;</hi> in regard that the vitious humors mingled together with the aliment may for a long while retain their own Nature, without any corruption, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion into <hi>Pus;</hi> as it evidently appeareth in the <hi>Cachexy,</hi> and <hi>Scabies</hi> or Scabbineſs, and the like affects in the Skin. But I very much doubt and queſtion, whether that different matter that is found in ſuch Tumors hath its original from the proper aliment of the neer adjoyning parts, the Hairs, the Nails, and the Bones, flowing together into ſome other place, and there mingling it ſelf with the proper aliment of the part affected. Neither is Matter ſufficient, or all that is required unto the formation of Hairs, Nails, Bones, and the like, but firſt of all, and eſpecially there is neceſſarily required the formative faculty, which in the fleſhy part formeth Fleſh, and in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous part a Membrane, and not Bones; and
<pb n="2512" facs="tcp:49110:60"/> there is unto each particular part a proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Membrane, which if it cannot attain unto its own end by reaſon of the unaptneſs of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it then formeth ſomthing like unto it; and in a fleſhy part it effecteth ſomthing that is like unto Fleſh, and in a membranous part ſomwhat that reſembleth a Membrane.</p>

                     <p>All theſe Tubercles or ſmal Tumors have their riſe from a very mean and inconſiderable begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and they are long, and by little and little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing; and they are included each one in its own peculiar Tunicle. And <hi>Meliceris</hi> is indeed more round in figure, and more extended, and when preſſed down by the Fingers (by reaſon that the thickneſs of the humor is not great) it ſpeedily yieldeth and giveth place, and upon the removal of the Fingers it as ſpeedily returneth back again. For although <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his ſixth Book, Chap. 36. writeth that <hi>Meliceris</hi> yieldeth unto the touch, even as if it were ſome looſe body; and that it is ſlowly diffuſed, but very ſoon collected and gathered together again; yet without doubt, the text is depraved, and ſomething omitted by the careleſsneſs and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfight of the Writers, which appeareth even from this, that he altogether omitteth the Signs of <hi>Atheroma.</hi> And therefore without all doubt it is thus to be read, the omiſſions being ſupplied out of <hi>Aetius;</hi> Steatoma <hi>is harder then the other, and reſiſteth upon the touch, and having the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom thereof more ſolid. But</hi> Atheroma <hi>yieldeth when it is touched, as it were a certain looſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and returneth back but ſlowly; but</hi> Meliceris <hi>giveth place ſpeedily unto the touch, and then it is very ſuddenly again collected.</hi> And although <hi>Steatoma</hi> be hard,; yet notwithſtanding it diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from <hi>Strumae,</hi> becauſe it is nothing ſo hard as <hi>Strumae;</hi> neither hath it an unequal Tumor, like as <hi>Strumae</hi> hath.</p>
                     <p>But what theſe Tumors have within, as it may be gueſſed at by conjecture, ſo true it is that it cannot be certainly known, unleſs it be when they are caſt forth; as <hi>Celſus</hi> tels us, in his ſeventh Book Chap. 6.</p>

                     <p>Although theſe Tumors differ in their names, and each of them contein a peculiar Matter: yet notwithſtanding they have almoſt one and the ſame way of curing. For Univerſals and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals being premiſed, and the Body throughly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the vitious humor, the matter that is the cauſe of the Tumor is together with the Tunicle to be taken away: which is done if the matter be either diſcuſſed; or (if that may not conveniently be done)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuppurated; or elſe if the Tumors be cut forth. In <hi>Meliceris</hi> this threefold kind of Remedy hath its place; <hi>Atheroma</hi> is Cured by Diſcuſſives and Suppuratives, and for the moſt part hath no need at all of Section. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Laudanum, Bdellium, Galbanum, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum, Propolis, and Turpentine, equal parts of them all; and mingle them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Very uſeful likewiſe is the Emplaſter made of Ammoniacum, Pellitory, and the Oyl of the Juyce therof; by which I have ſeen ſuch a Tumor cured in the Jaw-bone broken, and long white ſtrings like threads (ſuch as are ſomtimes found in Cancers) drawn forth.</p>
                     <p>Unſlaked Lime alſo mixed with Greaſe or Oyl is very uſeful, and of ſingular benefit. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Ship-pitch one ounce, Ammoniacum and Sulphur, of each half an ounce, Mingle, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Root of Sowbread, and Swines Greaſe, and a little Sulphur; and of theſe make an Empaſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Tumor open not of its own accord, then Section is to be ordained; that ſo the little Bladder (whether it contein a Subſtance like Honey, like a Pultiſe, or a fat ſubſtance, or any other) may be pulled forth, and taken away. But the Skin is not to be cut tranſverſly or overthwart, but ſtrait forward, or elſe ſomwhat obliquely, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the figure and form of a Myrtle Leaf; and the Membrane conteining the humor is to be freed from the Skin, and the part lying under it; great care and caution being had, leſt that the ſaid Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane or Bladder be hurt (which wil moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, if the Skin be not diſſected and opened with one touch of the Inſtrument) and ſo the humor that is conteined therein flowing forth all abroad hinder the operation, and by this means there be ſome of it, or ſomthing of the humor left remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning behind. And yet if this ſhould chance, and ſomwhat ſhould be left behind, it is to be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by theſe Remedies that we call <hi>Cathaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> For if there be any part of that Tunicle left to remain, the Tumor wil again return.</p>
                     <pb n="2513" facs="tcp:49110:60"/>
                     <p>If theſe kind of Tumors be in the Head (the little Bladder being taken forth) let the <hi>Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> be cut, and the Skul ſhaven, leſt that there be any Root that may be able to generate a new Tumor left remaining behind. But if the ſick perſon wil at no hand admit of this ſaid Section, or if otherwiſe it may not conveniently be done by reaſon of the Veins, then the Skin is to be broken through by Cauſtick Medicaments. The little bladder being taken forth, the Ulcer is to be conſolidated; and if the Skin be more looſe and extended than it ought to be, ſo that it cannot conveniently be drawn together; in this caſe whatſoever is ſuperfluous is to be cut away.</p>

                  <p>ANd hither likewiſe belong thoſe Tumors, which (to ſpeak truth) are referred to <hi>Melicerides, Atheromata,</hi> and <hi>Steatomata.</hi> But becauſe they privily happen unto the head, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have peculiar names impoſed on them; which yet notwithſtanding we find no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the more Ancient Greek or Latine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; but they have been invented and hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out by the more modern and barbarous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines; to wit, ſuch as are theſe; <hi>Teſtudo, Talpa</hi> or <hi>Topinaria,</hi> and <hi>Natta.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Teſtudo what it is.</note>To wit, <hi>Teſtudo</hi> is a great Tumor, ſoft, or at leaſt not very hard, in the Head, of a broader form, like unto, and after the manner of the Tortoiſe; from the likeneſs whereof it hath taken its name; growing forth at the firſt in the form and faſhion of a Cheſnut, but afterwards in the figure of an Egg; in the which there is contained a ſoft kind of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (a certain Tunicle being drawn over it; from whence it is by Authors referred to <hi>Melicerides</hi>) which ſticketh ſo faſt in the Skul, that for the moſt part it vitiateth and defileth it, and bringeth upon it a polluting rottenneſs.</p>
                  <p>Neerly allied unto this is the Tumor <hi>Talpa,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Talpa</note> ſo called becauſe that look as the Mole (by the Latines called <hi>Talpa</hi>) runneth under ground, juſt ſo this Tumor under the Skin feedeth upon the <hi>Cranium</hi> or Skul. Some of thoſe aforeſaid Latine Barbarous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors comprehend this Tumor under the name of <hi>Teſtudo,</hi> neither do they make any peculiar men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Talpa.</hi> But others of them have their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Tracts touching this Tumor <hi>Talpa;</hi> and <hi>Vigo</hi> in his ſecond Book, Tract. 3. and Chap. 1. doth expreſly diſtinguiſh <hi>Talpa</hi> from <hi>Teſtudo;</hi> and the truth is, they differ in their matter, which in <hi>Talpa</hi> is more thick and groſs than in <hi>Teſtudo.</hi> And therefore like as we have ſaid that <hi>Teſtudo</hi> may be referred unto <hi>Meliceris,</hi> ſo may <hi>Talpa</hi> be referred to <hi>Atheroma.</hi> Some cal it <hi>Topina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> But others notwithſtanding ſay that <hi>Topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria</hi> is a different Affect, and ſuch as is familiar and common unto Children; and that it is bred out of ſweet flegm; which is manifeſtly declared by the viſcouſneſs and clammineſs of the rotten fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, as alſo by the whiteneſs thereof: and ſomtimes from a flegm mingled with Blood; as the color declareth, which is not very red, and it ſoon cometh to a maturity; and ſomtimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from Melancholy, or Choler; as <hi>Gulielmus Placentius</hi> writeth of this ſame Affect in the firſt Book of his Chirurgery, and Chap. 5. <hi>Johannes Philippus Ingraſſias,</hi> in his Book of Tumors, Tract. 1. Chap. 1. without any the leaſt ſcruple conceiveth that this Tumor is to be referred to <hi>Hydrocephalus.</hi> But in regard that <hi>Hydroce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus</hi> is bred of Water, and hath no blood at al mingled therewith, neither may be ſuppurated, this therefore cannot be granted unto the ſaid <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſias,</hi> nor by any means allowed of.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, there is another Tumor which they cal <hi>Nata,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Natta</note> 
                     <hi>Natta,</hi> and <hi>Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> being great and ſoft, without any pain and color; growing forth eſpecially in the back, and ſomtimes notwithſtanding breaking forth in the ſhoulders, and other parts; hanging by a ſmal ſlender Root: but yet ſo greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing that it weigheth ſome pounds; and is in bigneſs equal unto a Melon, or Gourd; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath not alwaies one and the ſame form and figure, it hath likewiſe therefore by Authors divers and ſeveral names conferred upon it. The matter that is therein contained doth indeed now and then ſeem to be fleſhy; but in truth it is no fleſh, but like unto fat; and therefore it may not unfitly be referred unto <hi>Steatoma.</hi>

But in regard that theſe Tumors may be referred to <hi>Melicerides, Atheromata,</hi> and <hi>Steatomata,</hi> it may therefore moſt fitly be determined and aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That theſe Tumors have the very ſelf ſame cauſe that thoſe ſaid Tumors have: only here lieth the difference, That in theſe there is greater ſtore of matter, and thereupon it is likewiſe that theſe Tumors arrive at a greater bulk and bigneſs than the former.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Tumors are eaſily known from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions before declared; for they are ſoft Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, or at leaſt ſuch as are not very hard; broad and large, and ſhut up in their peculiar Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. If theſe kind of Tumors be in the Head, they then are dangerous, by reaſon of the vicinity and neerneſs of the Skull, in regard that they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode the Skul, and corrupt it; eſpecially about the Sutures.</p>

                        <pb n="2514" facs="tcp:49110:61"/>2. If there be preſent a great corruption of the Skul, it is then far better to let this Tumor alone, and not meddle with it, than to cure it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe of them that are without any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Skul, are cured with more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Like as it was in the Tumors mentioned in the former Chapter, ſo it is likewiſe in theſe; unleſs the whol Tunicle be drawn forth together with the humor, there is no perfect health and ſoundneſs to be expected, or hoped for; ſince that if there be any thing left behind, there wil from it a new Tumor ariſe, and break forth.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>Univerſals and generals being firſt premiſed, and the body ſufficiently evacuated, the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the Tumor is to be taken away, which is done by digeſtive and reſolving Medicaments, or by thoſe that ſuppurate, or by Chirurgery. And therefore if the Tumor be without any Ulcer and corruption of the bone, then let diſcuſſing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments be adminiſtred. Now the Diſcuſſives are ſuch as are wont to be uſed in <hi>Scrofulae</hi> and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. But it is ſomwhat rare that theſe Tumors are cured by Diſcuſſives. If therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo taken away and removed, to wit, by Diſcuſſives alone; then Maturatives and Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Medicaments are likewiſe to be adminiſtred; ſuch like as have been already propounded in the foregoing Chapter. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Onions roaſted under the Embers, the Yelks of Eggs hard boyled, of each three in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; Swines Greaſe, or unſalted Butter half a pound; the Root of Marſh-mallows boyled to a ſoftneſs, and bruiſed very ſmal one pound; and make a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet notwithſtanding we are not to expect and wait for a perfect Concoction and generation of <hi>Pus,</hi> in regard that <hi>Pus</hi> eaſily and ſoon gets a ſharp and malignant quality, and ſo corrodeth the Skul. And therefore ſo ſoon as any ſigns of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration ſhal appear, the Tumor is maturely to be opened. The Inciſion is to be either ſimple and downright, or elſe it is to be made in the form and figure of a Croſs, according to the bigneſs of the Tumor. The <hi>Pus</hi> being wholly evacuated, the Ulcer is to be throughly cleanſed by convenient Medicaments; as for example, with ſuch as this,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Barley Meal two ounces; Myrrh half an ounce; Sarcocol one ounce; Honey as much as will ſuffice; mingle, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ulcer when it is throughly cleanſed is to be filled up with Fleſh, and conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>If the bone be corrupted, it is then to be ſhaven, and to be cured in like manner as it is wont to be in the rottenneſs of the bones.</p>
                     <p>But as for the Cure by Chirurgery, it is to be ordained and inſtituted in like manner as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Chapter foregoing.</p>

                  <p>THere are moreover other Tumors likewiſe that are ſaid to have their original, not from humors, but from a ſolid ſubſtance. But ſince that theſe ſame humors take their original either from a vitious and luxuriant juyce nouriſhing the parts, or elſe from excrementitious humors mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, we wil therefore ſubjoyn this kind of Tumors unto thoſe that were but even now explained, and treated of.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of al, there are indeed certain ſmal Tumors that ariſe in the Skin, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to little hillocks,<note place="margin">Verrucae.</note> which are called <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rucae</hi> or <hi>Porri.</hi> For with the Latines <hi>Verruca</hi> is properly the higher and more eminent part of a Mountain or Hil, and according to <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> (in his third Book, and Chap. 7.) the rough part thereof; whereupon it is that thoſe places are termed <hi>Verrucoſa</hi> that are unequal, and have divers eminent parts. But now theſe <hi>Verrucae</hi> from their ſeveral forms have gotten divers and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral appellations. For one is called <hi>Seſſilis</hi> (by the Greeks <hi>Myrmecion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verruca ſeſſilis</note> and by the Latins <hi>Formica</hi>) which is fixed and faſtened with deeper roots; broad beneath, and ſlender above; and this thruſteth forth it ſelf in the Skin leſs than the other kinds of them; and it is likewiſe ſtable and permanent, and not altogether ſo movable as the reſt. Now they conceive that it is ſo named ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from their blackiſh color (ſuch as there is in Ants or Piſmires) or elſe becauſe that when it is hard preſſed, it exhibiteth a ſenſe of pain like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bitings of thoſe aforeſaid Piſmires; and it is for the moſt part bred in the Hands, or likewiſe in the Feet; neither is it altogether without pain; and in this there appeareth ſomtimes a hair or two, and that eſpecially in the face. Another fort of them is called <hi>Penſilis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verruca Penſilis</note> becauſe that it hangeth down by a little foot, or as it were by a Harp-ſtring; from whence it is by the Greeks called <hi>Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chordon;</hi> it hath but a very ſmal Baſis, but a long and great Head.</p>
                  <p>This Tumor if it be not of the ſame color, but that it reſembleth the flower of Thyme, and be leſs, and more unequal, and ſmal, they rhen cal it <hi>Thymum.</hi> But now if theſe <hi>Verrucae</hi> be greater, they are then (from the reſemblance they have with a Fig) called <hi>Ficus.</hi> And hither likewiſe may <hi>Condylomata</hi> be referred, as alſo <hi>Criſtae ani;</hi> touching which we have already ſpoken in the third Book of our Practiſe, Part 2.

                  <p>Now theſe <hi>Verrucae</hi> are bred in divers parts of the body; but more frequently in the hands and feet; and for the moſt part they appear many of them together.</p>

                     <p>But <hi>Platerus</hi> (as he did by the former Tumors that were neerly allied unto theſe) aſſerteth that the <hi>Verrucae</hi> likewiſe are bred of a juyce that is by Nature deſtined for the nouriſhing of the Skin, and the Scarf-skin, after the ſame manner. As the hardneſs that ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> conſiſteth in their ſubſtance generateth a Callouſneſs, and Cicatrices; even ſo a part and portion thereof breaking forth into one or more parts of the Skin, adhering unto the Skin, and growing unto the roots, and iſſuing forth it generateth a very ſmal portion, filling up the pore, hard, and callous; which one while is carried forth without the pore, as in <hi>Verruca Penſilis;</hi> other while it remaineth ſtil therein, as in <hi>Verruca Seſſilis,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Clavus</hi> in the feet. But now, that this juyce ſhould thruſt it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pores, the dilatation and wideneſs of them may very wel be the cauſe thereof: which as it proceedeth from divers cauſes, ſo in the feet (the skin being in one place hard preſſed down, and by this means the pore being widened) the Tumor <hi>Clavus</hi> is eaſily generated. In the hands like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whereas they there alſo often appear and expoſe themſelves unto the view, <hi>Platerus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectureth and conceiveth it to be very credible that theſe <hi>Verrucae</hi> proceed from external inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome alſo who determine that theſe ariſe likewiſe from contagion; as if the blood fal out of a <hi>Verruca</hi> (when it is cut) upon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, there may then a <hi>Verruca</hi> be generated in that part; and if any one ſhal uſe that linen with which the blood that came forth of theſe <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rucae</hi> was taken up and cleanſed away, even upon the uſe and wearing of the ſaid linen <hi>Verrucae</hi> (that is to ſay, Warts, and Corns) may ſucceed and follow thereupon.</p>

                     <p>For this end and purpoſe there is uſually admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred the Milk of Figs, and Spurge or Milkwort; and that indeed the Milk of the aforeſaid <hi>Tithymal</hi> or Spurge is in it ſelf alone very efficacious, <hi>Valeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus de Taranta</hi> writeth that it is ſo found to be by experience. Unſlaked Lime mingled with Sope is alſo profitable; which ſaid Medicament will be the more effectual, if there be added a little calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Vitriol, or Verdigreaſe, or a Cautery prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Sope Lye. Or,</p>

                        <hi>Take</hi> Orpiment, and let it be mingled with Oxymel, or the Milk of the aforeſaid Milkwort or Spurge, and let it be put upon the <hi>Verrucae.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful likewiſe is the Oyl of Vitriol and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur. And <hi>Johannes Andreas a Cruce</hi> doth here indeed in a wonderful manner commend the Oyl of Vitriol; and in this manner he applieth it. He provideth a little Knife of Lign-aloes, or the like, and this he dippeth in the Oyl of Vitriol, and by this means he freeth the <hi>Verruca;</hi> with which otherwiſe it is freed by an Iron Penknife.</p>
                     <p>The Chirurgery by which <hi>Verucccae</hi> are taken away is deſcribed by <hi>Galen,</hi> in his fourteenth Book of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 17. by <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his ſixth Book, Chap. 87. and by <hi>Rhaſes,</hi> in his Book of Diviſions, Chap. 124. And it is performed either by extraction, or exciſion, or elſe by aduſtion. They are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and pluckt forth with a Quill; the Circle whereof let it be equal unto the <hi>Verrucae;</hi> with this Quil let the <hi>Verrucae</hi> be on all ſides ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened and hard bound; and then afterward let the <hi>Verruca</hi> be looſned and drawn round about, and ſo by this means it may together with its root be pulled forth. The ſame is likewiſe performed by the Silver Pipe. There was one at <hi>Rome</hi> that uſually pluckt them forth by ſucking, and his Teeth together, as <hi>Galen</hi> in the place alleadged informeth us.</p>
                     <p>They are cut off, either by ſomething tied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them (to wit, the <hi>Verrucae Penſiles</hi>) is for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by a ſilken Thred, or ſome other Thred that is ſtrong, or elſe by a Horſe Hair, ſtill by degrees ſtreightning and drawing cloſe together the bond, until the <hi>Verrucae</hi> fall off. And if there remain behind any of its Root, it is to be waſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by a Cautery. Or elſe it is to be performed by an Iron, or fitting Pen-knife, ſo that the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rucae</hi> muſt firſt of all be ſcarified round about; and afterward let it be cut off with a ſharp Pen-knife, and with the Phlebotomy Inſtrument quite grub'd up by the Roots.</p>
                     <p>They are actually burnt, either by a little ſtick of the Beech Tree, lighted at one end; or elſe by a long ſharp Iron Bodkin, heated red hot, and applied to the <hi>Verruca</hi> through a ſmal Cane, that ſo the neer adjacent parts may not be hurt or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Or if a thin Iron plate having a hole bored through it according to the bigneſs of the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruca,</hi> be ſo applied unto the ſaid <hi>Verruca,</hi> that the <hi>Verruca</hi> alone appear through the hole, and then afterward it may be burnt with a red hot Iron, or with the flame of Fire. The burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed and ended, the Eſcar is then to be taken away, and the Ulcer to be healed in a fit and convenient manner. <hi>Fallopius</hi> (if other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies be not ſufficiently prevalent) burneth the <hi>Verruca</hi> with Sulphur, after this manner. He taketh the middle ſhel of a Walnut, and boreth it through according to the bigneſs of the <hi>Verruca</hi> or Wart, and ſo applieth the convex part thereof unto the place in which the Wart appeareth, ſo that it may ſtrictly and cloſely comprehend the <hi>Verruca</hi> or Wart, and that the <hi>Verruca</hi> may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear forth through the hole into the Cavity or hollow part of the ſhel. After this he puts in Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur into the hollow of the ſhel, and kindleth it; which being melted, and kindled, the <hi>Verruca</hi> is ſo long to be burnt as the Patient can wel endure it; and if it cannot at once doing this be wholly
<pb n="2517" facs="tcp:49110:62"/> extirpated, the aduſtion is to be repeated three or four times, in the manner aforeſaid. When the place ſhal be healed, it is then for ſome daies to be rubbed with the Leaves of Sallow, and ſo covered therewith that the <hi>Verruca</hi> may no more return, and ariſe anew.</p>

                     <hi>Avenzoar</hi> in his ſecond Book, and Chap. 5. hath ſomthing to this purpoſe: <hi>I have heard</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my Father ſay, that he once ſaw a certain man that had bred in his back a bone like unto the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns Horn, but it was leſs hard than a Natural bone. And my Father purged away the groſs humors that were in this man, and afterward he put exſiccative Medicines upon the bone; upon which the ſaid bone fel forth like as the Harts Horns ſhed and fall off in the Spring. And I my ſelf likewiſe had once a bone growing upon my back, which brought upon me much grief and pain: I then purged my ſelf from groſs humors, and I put upon the aforeſaid bone Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutives; ſo that it was for the greateſt part reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and that little remainder thereof was no hinderance at all unto me in the exerciſe of my natural operations. Therefore whenſoever thou find the like, do as I have ſaid. And when thou purgeſt them, do not purge them only with the virtues of Medicines, but even with the very proper Medicines themſelves. And in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the better Minerals (for the purging of theſe) the</hi> Lapis Lazuli <hi>is one; but without all doubt there is great help to be had from the Load-ſtone, in this caſe: but for my own part I make little or no uſe of the Load-ſtone in my practice, in regard that the</hi> Lapis Lazuli <hi>ſufficeth me; and I commend unto you the operation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet ſome there be of the latter Writers that reckon up theſe <hi>Cornua</hi> among the Affects of the Head; touching which <hi>Lanfracus</hi> (in his Tract. 3.

For I once ſaw a man that came unto me for advice that had in his Head ſeven eminencies, one grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the other, and they were in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Of which one was as big and acute as the Horn of a Kid, a finger long, or as long as ones thumb, and it much hurt and annoyed the Skin: and I admired that the Skin was not exulcerated. When therefore I ſaw that it had its original and root from the head, I would by no means be perſwaded to undertake the Cure, but rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the ſick perſon that he ſhould put himſelf into no mans hands, in hope of Cure, for that it ſeemed unto me altogether impoſſible.</hi> But <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Philippus Ingraſſias,</hi> in his firſt Tract of Tumors, and Chap. 1. relateth that he ſaw at <hi>Panormus</hi> a certain Noble Virgin (a Girl) that was afflicted with very many of theſe crooked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcencies, that were withal ſharpened in the top of them, like unto Calves Horns, almoſt in al the Limbs, and eſpecially in the Joynts of the Hands, the Arms, and the Knees, as alſo in the Head, and the Forehead. <hi>But yet notwithſtanding</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thoſe Tumors were not bred in the Skin, but upon it, and that indeed in a certain new order of generation.

At length he proceeded to Section, and the middle part of the foot, even to the Navicular bone, and the heel bone, was cut off. That which was thus cut off was wholly a hollow ſpungy fleſh, partly putrid and corrupt, and partly curdled, thick, and like unto a clammy porous fatneſs, and weighing wel neer four pound.

A Boy twelve yeers old was greatly troubled with the pain of his teeth.<note place="margin">Another Hiſtory.</note> At length it came to this, That they muſt be drawn. One of the upper teeth is accordingly drawn forth. Upon which there afterward aroſe a Tubercle in the Palate neer unto that Tooth, as big as a Prune ſtone. This being ſoft, and not opening of its own accord, it was conceived that there lay ſome <hi>Pus</hi> or purulent matter under it; whereupon it was opened, and at firſt there flowed forth nothing but ſome few drops of blood: but then afterward there brake forth a ſpungy and blackiſh fleſh, which ſo far encreaſed, that it did not alone hang forth at the mouth, but grew forth likewiſe by the Noſtrils, and at length brought death upon the Child.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius</hi> in his ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, Obſerv. 199. relateth likewiſe an Hiſtory of a <hi>Fungus</hi> that had its original from <hi>Gurgulio,</hi> that wholly filled up the Palate, and reached wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh unto the fore teeth. And another he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth in the following Obſervation, that ariſing from <hi>Gurgulio</hi> was altogether as big as an Hen Egg, and it ſo ſtopped up the little holes of the Noſtrils that end in the Palate, that the ſick party could hardly breathe; neither could he ſpeak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and ſo as to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius</hi> in his third Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Obſervat. 1. tels us yet likewiſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fungus</hi> that he had ſeen growing out of the Ear, and that he cured the ſame. And in his fifth Century, and Obſervat. 62. he mentioneth yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Fungus</hi> that ſprung and was bred out of the very Center of the Navel. This kind of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius</hi> in his third Century, Obſervat. 36. conceiveth that it is to be referred unto thoſe that we cal <hi>Nattae</hi> or <hi>Naptae.</hi> But what theſe <hi>Naptae</hi> are, we have before declared in the thirty ſixth Chapter. And although there be ſomthing of <hi>Fungus</hi> contained in the aforeſaid Tumor <hi>Natta;</hi> and albeit theſe Tumors may in the general be ſaid to be <hi>Fungus:</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that is covered over with the skin; but <hi>Fungi</hi> properly ſo called (and of which we are now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Johannes Philippus Ingraſſias</hi> (touching the Cauſe, and the manner of generation of theſe <hi>Fungi</hi>) writeth that this <hi>Fungus</hi> is wont to be bred in like manner as in Candles lighted or Lamps we ſee the <hi>Fungus</hi> (in the Winter time eſpecially) that is wont to ariſe and appear in the top of the Wick of the one, and the match of the other; and which is with weak and ſimple Women a notable preſage of Rain ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow; even as <hi>Virgil</hi> (in the firſt of his Georgicks) and <hi>Pliny</hi> likewiſe in his eighteenth Book about the end thereof, do both of them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. For when the Air begins to be moiſt, the ſparkles that were wont to paſs forth with the ſmoke, being now prohibited and hindred, by reaſon of the thickneſs of the Air, do there reſide in the Lights, and there they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as it were certain reſemblances and Images of <hi>Fungi.</hi> And juſt ſo it is in the Membrane of the Brain, when it is diſcovered and laid open, at the firſt there is a certain ſubſtance that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth the likeneſs of that ſoft and Cotton-like tender Hair that is found upon the heads of new born Infants. But then afterwards the vapors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcuſſed by exhaling, and the Fumes being made to aſſume a round form in that ſubſtance by the coldneſs of the Air, they are by little and little burnt and extreamly dried by the more inward heat, until at length there appear alſo a ſubſtance like unto the ſaid <hi>Fungus,</hi> ſignifying that the Membrane is altered by the Air.</p>
                     <p>But in very truth, it is indeed to be granted, that theſe kind of <hi>Fungi</hi> are generated from a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous humor, as it were ſweating forth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the hurt Membranes; but that this matter may be even deteined there by the coldneſs of the Air, and that it may likewiſe be there exſiccated meerly and only by the heat, is altogether falſe, and therefore not to be granted. For theſe <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi</hi> cannot poſſibly be ſo ſuddenly generated after this manner, and get ſuch a growth. But it is moſt agreeable unto truth, that the humor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling forth into the ſoft Fleſh (that is ſpungy like to the Muſhrom in Trees) is changed by the formative faculty of the part; and that Nature which is never idle doth change and form into this ſubſtance the humors flowing thereunto, which by reaſon of their abundance (as likewiſe their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WE are at length come to treat of a certain kind of Tumors ariſing from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, that have joyned with them a Malignity. Among the which the firſt we meet withall are the ſmal Pox and Meaſils. But becauſe we have already handled them in the fourth Book of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Chap. 12. we ſhal here add no more as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; but rather refer the Reader thither, for his further information. And then the next we meet withall are thoſe we call <hi>Bubones</hi> and peſtilent Carbuncles; touching which we ſhall likewiſe here in this place ſpare our pains in the further treating thereof, in regard that we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſpoken of them in the place alleadged, to wit, the ſixth Chapter. There likewiſe belong hither (in the third place) thoſe Tumors that we term Venereal, of which we ſhall hereafter treat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in its proper place, among the malignant Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.
<pb n="2528" facs="tcp:49110:64"/> And laſtly, there is this <hi>Elephantiaſis,</hi> touching which alone we intend here to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>That Affect which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Lepra,</hi> we have told you above (in Chap. 28.) that it is by the Greeks called <hi>Elephantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi>

                  <p>Or elſe this Malady is ſo called, becauſe that creeping along upon the Thighs it cauſeth them to become (as are thoſe of an Elephant) rough and unequal: or elſe becauſe that among other Diſeaſes this is exceeding vehement, ſtrong and violent, like as is the Elephant; or otherwiſe it is ſo called (and this indeed ſeemeth to be the moſt true and genuine reaſon thereof) becauſe the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers &amp; the skin of thoſe that are affected with this Diſeaſe are rendered tumid and ſwoln, ſcaly, rough and rugged, ful of ſwellings, and unequal, like unto the skin of Elephants. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Tumors, Chap. 14. writeth that this Malady when it firſt beginneth, is likewiſe called <hi>Satyriaſmus,</hi> in regard that the face of thoſe that are afflicted with this Diſeaſe is rendered like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the face of the ſaid Satyres. For the lips of ſuch as are troubled with <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> are thereby made thick, and the Noſe ſwelleth; and thereupon it ſeemeth as if it were preſſed down; the Ears become flaggy and much waſted, the Jaw bones are colored, as it were, and overſpread with a certain kind of redneſs, and in the Forehead there appear here and there Tumors or Swellings, like as if they were certain Horns: although there be others indeed that think the <hi>Satyriaſmus</hi> to be ſo called, even for this very cauſe, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Malady the ſick parties are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly libidinous and luſtful, like as are the ſaid Satyres.

The higheſt and utmoſt parts of the body have in them both ſpots and ſwellings that ſtand thick and cloſe one by the other. The redneſs of theſe parts is by little and little converted into a black color. The top of the skin is unequally both thick and thin, hard and ſoft, and is exaſperated by certain ſcales; the body waxeth lean; the mouth, the calves of the legs, and the feet ſwel, and are puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up. When the diſeaſe comes once to be old, the fingers and toes are quite hidden under the

                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>The containing cauſe is black Choler (and this not without malignity) diffuſed and ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad throughout the whol body. Now we find touching the generating of this humor. viz. black choler, a long and tedious diſpute among Authors; and we find them holding divers and different Opinions. In this (the truth is) they al agree, that this humor is generated from the adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and burning of other humors; but then in this they differ, viz. from the aduſtion of what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors this proceedeth. <hi>Avicen</hi> in the third Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his fourth Book, Tract. 3. Chap. 1. ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have comprehended them all; whiles he mentioneth five Species or kinds of this humor. The firſt is that which proceedeth from the Blood; the ſecond that from the melancholly humor; the third that which is from the aduſtion of bitter Choler; the fourth that which ariſeth from Flegm burnt; the fift and laſt, that that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the thick, and hot part (as being very apt to be burnt) of the Chyle, as to Inſtance, from all ſalt Fleſh, Fiſh, and the like. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot be denied, that there is here in this caſe an aduſtion of humors preſent, and that ſalt humors are the cauſe of this Malady; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſince that there are very many other Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and Ulcers that have their original from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt humors, here therefore the very ſpecifical cauſe is altogether to be ſought for, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding cannot eaſily be explained; but it conſiſteth in an occult <hi>i. e.</hi> an hidden and ſecret Malignity. But now this humor is diffuſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout all the Veins; and an inductive Feaver is diſperſed (without any putridneſs at all) tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout the whol body, and is mingled together with the aliment.</p>
                     <p>But now there are many things that conduce and make to the generation of this humor. There are ſome that contract the original ſeeds of this Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from their very birth; to wit, ſuch as either are born of Elephantiack Parents, or elſe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved during the Flux of the monthly Courſes, viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and corrupt, and declining unto black Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. And moreover alſo the hot and dry diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Members deſtin'd by Nature for Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as for example, the Liver, and the Spleen; from whence it is that the Blood and the humors are burnt) is deſervedly reckoned up and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted among the Cauſes of this Malady. And furthermore, the frequent and common uſe of ſalt meats maketh likewiſe very much hereunto, as alſo the eating of ſharp and ſowr meats, and food that is overgroſs and thick: the Air alſo being overhot and dry; or elſe thick and Cloudy: from whence it is that this Malady is in ſome Countries more frequent and uſual, and in other Regions ſcarcely known; as the Poet <hi>Lucretius</hi> tels us in his ſixth Book: <hi>Elephas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a Diſeaſe that (by reaſon of the overflowings of the River</hi> Nilus) <hi>is bred in the midſt of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and no where elſe.</hi>

                     <p>But although it be true that the Diſeaſe is more frequently found there; as <hi>Galen</hi> likewiſe teſtifieth in his ſecond Book to <hi>Glauco,</hi> and Chap. 10. (where he acknowledgeth that in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> by reaſon of the fervent heat of that Region, and the unfitting Diet of the Inhabitants, who eat Meal boyled, Lentiles, and Cockles, many ſalt meats, and the fleſh of Aſſes, with divers other ſorts of food that generate and breed a thick me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly humor, there are more that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this <hi>Elephantiack</hi> Diſeaſe) yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is alſo to be found in other Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In <hi>Germany</hi> (eſpecially in ſome parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) theſe Elephantiack Perſons are very common and ordinary; but in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> they are far more frequently found; and in <hi>Gallia Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonenſis,</hi> and <hi>Aquitain,</hi> there are more of them to be found then in al <hi>France</hi> beſides. <hi>Pliny</hi> in his twenty ſeventh Book, and Chap. 1. writeth, that before the time of <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> was never known to happen in <hi>Italy.</hi> Living and Converſing likewiſe with the Elephantiack Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons much conduceth to the cauſing of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. For the Air (that in breathing is attracted and drawn in) is infected by the ſtench of the Members, and the vitiated exhalation of the Breath. From whence it is that men deſervedly ſhun the company of thoſe that are thus affected; and for ſuch as are domeſtick, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily conſtrained to abide under the ſame Roof, do yet (as there is good reaſon for it) ſhun their company, and all neer Converſe with the ſick Perſons; and therefore even for this cauſe it is that theſe Elephantiack Perſons are ſeparated from the ſociety and company of others; and are ſent away, and diſpoſed of in ſome open places, in the which they live with moſt benefit unto themſelves, and leſs endangering others. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially carnal copulation with the Leprous man or Woman is undoubtedly dangerous and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and ſo is likewiſe that carnal ſociety that any one hath with her that before hath had to do with a Leprous man. Unto theſe ſame Cauſes there belongeth alſo the retention of the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Excretions; as the ſuppreſſion of the monthly Courſes, and the Haemorrhoids, and the ſudden ſtanching and drying up of long continued Ulcers. For ſuch a like humor as this (if it be detei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned long in the Body) becometh worſe and worſe dayly, and at length acquireth this malignity, and being reteined in the Body it ſeateth and ſetleth it ſelf in the Veins, and infecteth the whol maſs of Blood. Moreover this Malady doth more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently invade and ſeiz upon men then women; and among men, thoſe eſpecially that have in

                     <p>But now as it is in other Diſeaſes, ſo it is here, that there are likewiſe certain times of this Malady. The beginning is, when the vitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and the malignity is yet but as it were laying ſiege and beleaguering the Bowels. The incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or increaſe, when the Malady now ſhews it ſelf abroad and openly, and that the Symptoms are daily augmented. The ſtate, when the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are exaſperated, and the whol concourſe of the ſymptoms appeareth publickly, the which we ſhal immediately ſubjoyn. Firſt of all the Eyes appear exactly round, and the looks thereof are fixed and immovable; which happeneth by reaſon of the conſumption of the fat, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of the Muſcles; the Eye-lids and the Ears are contracted and drawn together; the Eye-brows fall down, the Noſe ſwelleth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and is made flat, by reaſon of the afflux of the humor, and it is ſtreightened within; from whence it is that the paſſage is obſtructed, and the breathing hindred, ſo that they ſeem to ſpeak as it were through their Noſes; the colour of the Face is wan and Leaden coloured; the aſpect and looks frightful; there appear Tubercles and red Puſtules under the Eye-brows, about the Ears, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ivers places of the Face, and knots hard and round, like unto Grains; the Lips are made thick, the Bones neer unto the Ears ſtick forth; the Hairs of the Head ſhed and fall away; and if the Hair be pulled forth, a part likewiſe of the white Skin is pulled away together with it; which is a moſt certain and infallible ſign of the Leproſie. This Malady diſcovereth it ſelf like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in other parts: the Veins under the Tongue ſwel, and become blackiſh; and the Glandules that lie neer unto the Tongue (and round about it) have in them round Tumors, like unto the <hi>Scrofulae</hi> that are in Swine, which we call the Swine pox. The Breath ſtinketh, the Voice is hoarſe, ſhril, and obſcure, by reaſon that the Lungs and the parts ſerving for Reſpiration are filled and beſet about with thick &amp; aduſt humors, and by reaſon alſo of the drineſs and roughneſs of the <hi>Trachaea Arteria,</hi> or the great rough Artery. In the Hands the Muſcles are extenuated, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally between the Thumb and the fore Finger; for whereas thoſe Muſcles are naturally lifted up into an hilly and manifeſt ſwelling, the depreſſion of them and their being emaciated (happening by reaſon of the defect of aliment) becomes the more manifeſt and remarkable in them; the Nails are cleft; there is preſent a ſtupidity, and want of feeling in the Ankles, and the Calves of the Legs, and in the Feet alſo; ſo that although the ſick Perſons ſhall be pricked with Pins or Needles in thoſe places yet they feel it not, in regard of the vitious matter filling up and obſtructing the part &amp; hindering the acceſs of the ſpirits. The ſame like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſomtimes befalleth the Fingers and Toes, in the which there is alſo perceived a coldneſs and a certain privation of al ſenſe and feeling; and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times likewiſe that ſtupidity and ſleeping (as they cal it) chanceth unto the whol Skin between thoſe Fingers, and extendeth it ſelf even unto the Arm; &amp; from the Foot it extendeth it ſelf even unto the Knees, the Thighs, and the Hips; yea moreover the ſenſe of feeling is diminiſhed throughout the whol body in Elephantiack Perſons. For all the Nerves and Pores being obſtructed and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhut up by the thickneſs of the humors will not allow and afford any paſſage unto the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits. In ſome certain places under the Skin there is perceived and felt a kind of ſtinging (ſuch as is cauſed by Emmets or Piſmires) as if Nettles were rubbed thereupon; and likewiſe a certain kind of itching and tickling, as if there were Worms creeping there, and this is by reaſon of the aduſt fumes and burnt vapors aſcending up under the Skin. The Skin it ſelf is wholly Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous and Oyly (ſo that Water poured upon it wil hardly ſtick and abide) by reaſon of the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fat under the Skin, and the effuſion of fat excrements thereinto. Others there are that unto theſe ſigns add other ſigns alſo. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe us to take ſome few grains of Salt, and to caſt it upon the Blood; becauſe that if the Blood be infected the Salt is preſently reſolved and melted; but on the contrary, if the Blood be not infected. They command us likewiſe to caſt this Blood into the pureſt and cleareſt Water; and if it ſwim at top, it is corrupted; but the contrary if it ſink to the bottom. Others there be that take the Blood and putting it in a clean Linen Cloth they waſh it;
<pb n="2524" facs="tcp:49110:67"/> for if there then appear in it certain blackiſh, rough, and as it were ſandy bodies, it argueth a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie. But there are other ſigns alſo of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady; and indeed there is ſcarcely any evil, miſchief, or inconvenience, that is not annexed thereunto; and in the which there is hardly any thing within or without that is ſound. But yet notwithſtanding the Face is eſpecially to be conſidered; neither is any one raſhly to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Leprous, unleſs the figure of the Face be corrupted. And therefore ſince that in ſome Common-wealths there is inſtituted and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Annual Examination and Search in and about theſe Elephantiack perſons, and that this is the chief, if not the whol buſineſs of the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; he ought therefore to uſe the utmoſt of his endeavor, and to be very cautious, that through imprudence, or by a raſh and precipitate Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he do not cauſe ſuch to be exiled and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from al ſociety that are not infected with this Diſeaſe; and on the other hand, for thoſe that are infected therewith, that he do not permit them to live and converſe with ſuch as are ſound, to the great endangering of them. And this he may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, if he have in his eye al the ſigns before recounted and mentioned; and if he wil likewiſe but duly weigh and conſider, which of them are proper unto them, and inſeparable from them; and what they have common with other Diſeaſes. In the ſerious examination of al which <hi>Franciſcus Valeriola</hi> hath taken extraordinary pains, in the ſixth Book of his Enarrations, Enarrat. 5. the Reader may do wel to conſult the place alleadged. We muſt not here alſo paſs by in ſilence that which <hi>Marcellus Donatus</hi> hath in his firſt Book of the Hiſtory of things wonderful in Phyſick, Chap. 4. by which we have occaſion given us to think and conjecture, how great the corruption of the blood may poſſibly be in thoſe that are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous. <hi>Annibal Pedemontanus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been for two yeers vexed and afflicted with an incurable Lepra, he was at the end thereof taken and ſurprized with a Pleuriſie; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Vein opened, this ſtrange thing befel him; the hot <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine that came from him (being in quantity more than the pot could wel hold, and upon which there ſwam a blood at leaſt ſix ounces in weight) ſo ſoon as it was cooled was by the ſaid blood thickned in ſuch a manner, juſt as if the water had been Milk, and the blood the Curd thereof; ſo that in its conſiſtency it ſeemed to be very like unto curdled Milk; yet ſtill retaining its own proper color; of the which there was not one drop indeed to be found that was ſevered from the reſt, and not curdled.</hi> The cauſe hereof is given by the Author before cited, who conceived it to be, and imputeth it unto the thickneſs and clammineſs of the blood, which being throughly mingled with the Water, (the actual heat of both of them aſſiſting and furthering the diſtribution in their mingling together) when it had abated of its great heat, and was now become cool, gave the occaſion of the ſaid coagulation or curdling. And he conceiveth likewiſe that here the very ſame thing happened that cometh to paſs, when the ſmal parts and pieces that are cut from Hides and Skins are boyled in Water for the making of Glew. For ſo ſoon as ever that Water is cooled, it inſtantly is thruſt and forced cloſe together, by reaſon of the clammineſs and ſlimineſs of the juyce; and the like alſo happeneth in ſome kind of meats that we eat, that are made of Calves feet, and the feet of other living Creatures.</p>

For an <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> inveterate and confirmed wil at no hand admit of any Cure.

This Diſeaſe is exceeding great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, to wit, from the great ſtore of corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; and there is in the body an extream and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe heat, to wit, ſo great that if any one thus affected (but for a ſhort ſpace) hold in his hand a new and green Apple, it wil become wrinkled and withered, even as if it had been for ſome long time dried by the heat of the Sun and the Air. And this ſame very malignity hath now of a long time taken deep root. For this Malady diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it ſelf but very ſlowly; neither doth it at al appear before that the malignity of the humors have beſieged (as I may ſo ſay) and ſhal have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the bowels.

For as <hi>Aetius</hi> writeth, Tetrab. 4. Serm. 1.

                     <p>As for what concerneth the Cure of this Diſeaſe; in the curing of an <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> that is but new begun, it is above all other things neceſſary and requiſite that the vitious humors be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the body; which to attempt wil yet notwithſtanding be but in vain, unleſs there be withal ſuch a like Diet firſt ordained and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as by the which there may be no more of the vitious and bad humors gathered and heaped up together; but that thereby rather the fault and whatever is amiſs in the humors and the body may be rectified and amended. And this is done by ſuch things as cool and moiſten, to wit, as they are contrary unto the preternatural diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, being hot and dry. Broths and ſuppings are in this caſe therefore very fit and proper; which may be qualified with Sorrel, Bugloſs, and Borrage; unto which likewiſe (as unto al other food the Patient eats) Harts-horn may be added and mingled therewith; as having in it an eſpecial and peculiar virtue of oppugning and ſubduing that aforeſaid malignity. Let his Meats be ſuch as afford a good and commendable juyce, and withal eaſie of digeſtion; his fleſh rather boyled than roaſted; or if at any time it be roſted, then among other Condiments, Sauces, or Sallades, let there be appointed him theſe that follow, viz. Sorrel, Lettice, the juyce of Citrons, Vinegar of Roſes, and C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>pars. But chiefly we commend the cream of Barley, with the Milk of ſweet Almonds. And on the contrary, let the Patient carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoid al ſalt meats, and ſuch as being ſalted are then ſmoke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when the ſick perſon is at his meals thirſty, mere and undiluted Wine is very hurtful for him, in regard that the heat and drineſs of the Patients body is thereby augmented: and as for Beer, thick humors are for the moſt part thereby generated; and therefore it wil be requiſite to find out for him another kind of Drink that he may dayly make uſe of without any the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. Of which ſort, the chief and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal is that drink that is made of the juyce of ſweet ripe Apples, and then throughly cleanſed from its Lees and Dregs. For this Drink is of ſingular uſe and benefit, not only for thoſe that are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantiack, but likewiſe for al Melancholy and Hypochondriacal perſons, as alſo for al others, whoſe Liver and Meſentery or Midrif afford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and cauſe of a diſeaſe.

                     </p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the Patient hath taken his Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, let him preſently be put into a Ceſtern filled with ſweet Water; and let him fit herein for the ſpace of one hour. But let the Bath be ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate that there be no ſweat cauſed, either in the Bath, or after his going out of it. For if any Sweat be excited, it is a ſign that the Bath is hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then it ought to be. There are many Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians that forthwith ſend away the Patients unto the Natural and Mineral Waters. But in regard that they dry exceedingly, there oftentimes ariſeth thence more hurt then good; eſpecially in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Diſeaſe, while the heat and drineſs are at the higheſt. And there a Bath of ſweet Water is far more commodious and ſafe, which tempereth the drineſs, diſcuſſeth the excrements, and looſneth the Skin. After Bathing, the body may be anointed over with this Medicament fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, or ſuch like;</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Juyce of Nighſhade, and of Scabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, of each one ounce; the Root of the ſharp Dock ſix drams, Vinegar of Roſes one ounce, Elecampane root and Pimpernel, of each half an ounce; Oyl of Roſes four ounces; the Rinds of black Hellebor tied up in a piece of skin, three drams; boyl them them until the Juyces be boyled away, and after this caſt away the black Hellebor; and then,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>freſh Butter one ounce and half, Vipers fat, or if that cannot be had, the beſt Treacle one ounce, burnt Lead half an ounce, Litharge and Ceruſs, of each two drams; Frankincenſe a dram and half,</hi> Styrax Calamite <hi>and Nitre, of each two ſcruples; Mingle and ſtir them wel about together with the Juyce of Lemmons, in a Leaden Mortar with a Leaden Peſtle, untill it hath gotten the form of a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After bathing let him likewiſe uſe this Remedy, which ſome hold for a great ſecret: They burn in a new Pot the Head of a Kite, which after it is pulled and made bare of its Feathers, they cut off, as alſo the Feet and the Bowels being taken out; and of the Powder hereof they adminiſter what they think requiſite in a fit, and convenient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; and they preſcribe likewiſe the eating of the reſt of the Fleſh at thrice, that is to ſay, a third part each day, for three daies together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solenander</hi> writeth that he himſelf made uſe of this following Remedy, and that with very good ſucceſs. He taketh two or three Vipers or (if they cannot readily be gotten) other Snakes, and diſſecteth them alive, and then toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with good ſtore of Barley he puts them into Water, and boyleth them until the Barley become ſoft. With this Barley, as alſo with the very Fleſh it ſelf of theſe Snakes he feeds many Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets or Chickens, and gives them no other food; with the which after they have been for ſome few daies nouriſhed they loſe their Feathers, and within a ſhort time they again get new ones; and afterward with this Fleſh and Broths made of them he nouriſheth the ſick Perſon by little and little. And indeed this Remedy out of Vipers we find to be much uſed by the Ancients. For the body being firſt purged, in the ſpring time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, they took Vipers and cutting off the Head and Tail (caſting away the Skin) they gave the Fleſh of theſe Vipers to be eaten by their Patients thus affected. But <hi>Julius Palmarius</hi> aſſureth us that <hi>Fernelius</hi> (although he made it a good part of his Study) yet he could not once in all his life time effect what he ſo much wiſhed and ſo diligently ſtudied for, to wit, the recovery and reſtoring of any by the uſe of Vipers. And by his advice likewiſe <hi>Palmarius</hi> himſelf admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred theſe Vipers, and not only the fleſh of them

                        <pb facs="tcp:49110:69"/>
                        <pb n="2527" facs="tcp:49110:69"/> prepared divers waies (thus and thus) but the very Treacle it ſelf alſo that is made of them; and yet notwithſtanding without any the leaſt ſucceſs. For although at the firſt in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Diſeaſe, this kind of Remedy may ſeem to benefit much; yet notwithſtanding at the length by it the Elephantiack poyſon and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is thruſt forth into the Skin, and all the ſymptoms ſo exaſperated (as he writeth) that in the end the putridneſs being augmented, they are as it were torn in ſunder Limb after Limb. But however in regard that the Ancients have ſo much commended the uſe of Vipers, and ſome likewiſe of our latter Phyſitians have extolled the uſe of them, we therefore in this particular adviſe you to conſult experience.</p>
                     <p>The Ancients likewiſe for a Remedy uſed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration or Gelding; and they tell us in their writings, that many have been recovered by this means: Which (as <hi>Valeſcus de Taranta</hi> conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctureth) therefore cometh to paſs, becauſe that the Leproſie proceeding from an overdrineſs, the body by the taking away the Stones becometh much moyſtened, being hereby much effeminated; and ſo by this means the humidity thereof is in great meaſure retained.</p>
                     <p>And that we may conclude this Diſcourſe, the <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> alone (as <hi>Palmarius</hi> writeth) more than any other of thoſe Diſeaſes that are of long continuance ſeemeth to rejoyce it ſelf as it were in the variety and interchange of Remedies. And there are in this affect (if in any other) certain ceſſations and intermiſſions (almoſt from all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies) oftentimes to be allowed unto the ſick Perſon; and then the ſame Remedies are anew to be repaired, and new ones to be added; ſince that ſcarcely ever did any recover of this Diſeaſe, that placed the hope of his ſafety in one only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, though it were never ſo generous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Julius Palmarius</hi> puts much confidence in Hydrarge, which as he writeth doth every whit as much in this caſe as the fleſh of Vipers, or the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perine Treacle, or the Iron Inſtrument, or the Fire. But in regard that it wil take up too much of our time, and coſt much pains here to acquaint you with all that we might touching this ſubject; And in regard alſo that the ſame <hi>Palmarius</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> hath taken notice of many other ſuch like Obſervations as touching this Diſeaſe; and that <hi>Aetius</hi> likewiſe, Tetrab. 4 Serm. 1. Chap. 121. &amp;c. hath collected very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things concerning it; and that much alſo may be found in <hi>Foreſtus</hi> his <hi>Roſa Anglica,</hi> and in other Authors that have written upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and laſtly, in regard that <hi>Schenkius</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the ſixth Book of his Obſervations hath collected many ſtrange and rare things touching this <hi>Elephantiaſis;</hi> in all theſe reſpects, I think it not amiſs to refer the Reader unto thoſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Authors, for his more ſtill ſatisfaction. And <hi>Petrus Palmarius</hi> likewiſe in his <hi>Lapis Philoſoph.

                  <p>ANd thus have we now at length diſpatched and finiſhed the Explication of al thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that have their original from the Humors; it now remaineth that in the next place we treat of thoſe Tumors that ariſe from winds. For there are peculiar Tumors that have their original from flatulency, or a flatulent and windy ſpirit; which the Greeks call <hi>Pneumatoſeis,</hi> and <hi>Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumatoſeis,</hi> and <hi>Emphyſemata;</hi> but the Latines call them <hi>Inflationes.</hi> Now this flatulent Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor (as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us, in his Book touching the courſe of Diet in acute Diſeaſes, Comment. 4. Text. 21.) is generated after a twofold manner; to wit, <hi>By a flatulent Spirit collected in certain Cavities theſe Cavities being either expoſed to the ſenſe, or elſe ſuch as are Contemplable by Reaſon.</hi> Now by Cavities contemplable by reaſon (as he explains himſelf in his ſecond Book to <hi>Glauco,</hi> &amp; Chap. 5.) he underſtandeth thoſe very Pores of the ſimilary parts, and thoſe little ſpaces that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed betwixt the ſaid ſimilary parts.</p>

                     <p>The Proxime, <hi>i. e.</hi> the neereſt and conjunct Cauſe of his Tumor is a Wind, or flatulent Spirit. Now this is generated (as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth in his third Book of the Cauſes of Symptoms, and Chap. 4.) from a heat weak and languiſhing. For as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Cold cannot poſſibly excite any Vapor, ſo on the other ſide, vehement heat diſcuſſeth the Vapor. That which ſupplieth matter unto theſe flatulencies, is a humor, thick, flegmatick, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick. The ſame do both flatulent Meats and Drinks afford, as alſo a cold, moiſt, and clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Air, an idle and ſedentary life, and the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of accuſtomed Evacuations. The thickneſs of the part likewiſe that wil not permit the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors to breath forth maketh much for the accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and heaping up of Winds.</p>

                     <p>The flatulent Tumor is known by this; That the part is ſomtimes lifted up into a greater, and ſomtimes into a leſs heighth; and oftentimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there is from the diſtenſion a pain excited; but yet notwithſtanding there is no kind of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs felt and perceived in the parts; and unleſs the wind be ſhut up in ſome cavity, it doth very ſeldom continue long in one place, but wandereth up and down. If the Tumor may be preſſed with the finger it leaveth no pit; but the Tumor either reſiſteth the touch of the finger, or elſe the wind paſſeth unto ſome other part; and if it he ſmote with the hand, it then ſendeth forth a noiſe like hat of a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THere remaineth now to be ſpoken of the laſt kind of Tumors, which the ſolid and living parts excite. For theſe if out of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place they fal down into another place, or elſe reſt and lie thereon, they then elevate the parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, and more eſpecially the skin; and ſo by this means they excite a Tumor or Swelling. But now, the Bones are thoſe that principally do this. For theſe if in either their disjoyntings they fal out of their proper places or ſeats, or if being broken they change their ſcituation, they then lift up the part incumbent into a Tumor. But there is no need that we ſpeak any thing in ſpecial, and particularly, touching theſe kind of Tumors. For like as they proceed from, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon disjoyntings, diſlocations, and fractures, ſo they are by them wel known; and theſe being cured, they vaniſh.</p>

                  <p>There is likewiſe mention made by <hi>Galen</hi> (in his Book of Tumors, Chap. 14, &amp; 15. and 14. of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 17.) of a peculiar ſort of Tumors ariſing from the Bones, and this he calleth <hi>Exoſtoſis,</hi> you may cal it <hi>Exoſſatio,</hi> to wit, Emmencies and ſtandings out of the Bones, and eſpecially thoſe of the Temples, and in other parts alſo: but as touching theſe.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>fleſh produced do firſt fill up the place that is neer about the Artery cut aſunder, but that there ſtill remaineth ſome void and vacant place, then verily there followeth that Tumor we call Aneuryſma.</hi> Other Greek Phyſitians there are that are of the ſame Judgment and Opinion with <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi> For thus <hi>Aetius</hi> writeth touching this <hi>Anou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſma,</hi> Tettab. 4. Serm. 3. Chap. 10. <hi>Anecuryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> happeneth in every part of the Body, but more frequently in the Throat; where it produceth that Tumor we cal <hi>Bronchocele.</hi> It befalleth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes unto Women in Child-bed, by reaſon of the violent detention and holding of their breath: but it happeneth likewiſe in the Head, nigh unto the places of the Arteries; and in the reſt of the body alſo, where ever the Arteries are wounded: like as when ignorant and unexpert Phyſitians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and attempting to open a Vein in the Arm, do withal prick, and oftentimes cut aſunder the Artery lying underneath it. The very ſame is told us by <hi>Paulus Aegineta,</hi> in his fourth Book, and Chap. 53.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Opinion is borrowed from the Greeks by <hi>Avicen</hi> the Arabian, as appeareth by what he writeth in <hi>Quart. quarti,</hi> Tract. 2. Chap. 16. <hi>And when the place of the Artery</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not from above coarctated and conjoyned cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, after the ſolution of its continuity, and that it findeth a voidneſs or vacuity, then the thing comes even to an</hi> Emboriſmus, <hi>which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Mother of Blood.</hi> And a little after, thus he writeth: <hi>And very many times</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Artery is not indeed covered over with fleſh, but that which containeth the Artery is incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and covered with fleſh and is coarctated and cloſely conjoyn'd upon it. Wherefore the blood cannot have nor make any ſuperfluous courſe; yea ſomthing goeth out of it even unto the ends of the skin, which it receiveth and taketh in the quantity; and whenſoever it is eaſily and gently preſſed together, it returneth, and it's altogether hidden, like as we ſee it to happen in Ruptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Opinion very many, and indeed moſt of the latter Phyſitians do follow. Yea, and <hi>Platerus</hi> himſelf likewiſe, who is otherwiſe wont to take liberty enough in examining the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the Ancients, writeth, That <hi>Aneuryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> doth not only ariſe from the dilatation of the Artery (it yet remaining ſhut and entire) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that more frequently (it not alwaies, if it be in the exterior parts) it proceedeth from a certain manifeſt and apparent opening thereof. For then the thin and ſprightful blood breaking forth of the Artery under the skin lifteth it up into a Tumor or Swelling, and there formeth and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth unto it ſelf a hollow nook, and there in the Artery cauſeth this pullation in this Tumor; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven almoſt in the ſame manner as the Arteries are wont to empty themſelves naturally into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="2530" facs="tcp:49110:71"/> nooks of the thick Membrane of the Brain; ſo here they do it preternaturally, by pouring forth the blood (with and in breathing) in its <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> and in its <hi>Syſtole</hi> receiving it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>But this is an Opinion that I could never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of; and therefore in the yeer 1606.(when I interpreted <hi>Galen</hi>'s little Book of Tumors) I altogether rejected it; and I then likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded another, which out of thoſe Lectures of mine, that noted and famous man Dr. <hi>Bernhard</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> made uſe of and Inſerted likewiſe in his Treatiſe of the Inſpection of Wounds. For if <hi>Aneuryſma</hi> ſhould proceed from the Effuſion of the Arterial blood under the Skin; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the ſaid blood would diffuſe and diſperſe it ſelf, in length, and breadth, and round about; and would dye and colour the Skin of another Hieu; like as we ſee it to happen in Contuſions, and in the opening of a Vein, when it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and rightly performed; to wit, when either the Vein is wholly cut through, or elſe when the Wound thereof by reaſon of the impetuouſneſs and violence of the Blood is not rightly cloſed. For then the blood is very often poured forth under the Skin, even unto the extream and utmoſt part of the Hand; and the Skin is dyed with a Red, Green, and Yellow colour. Which muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily happen ſo much the more, if an Artery be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; in regard that the Arterial blood is thinner, and floweth forth with a greater force &amp; violence: which yet notwithſtanding never happeneth in <hi>Aneuryſma,</hi> in the which that Tumor is conteined within its own Limits, and as it were in a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: neither is the Skin dyed with any other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor. And moreover if <hi>Aneuryſma</hi> proceeded from a Blood poured forth under the Skin, in progreſs of time it would ſo happen that this Blood conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and abiding in a ſtrange and unfit place would putrefie like as we ſee it uſually doth in <hi>Ecchymoma,</hi> as we told you before in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antonius Saporta</hi> indeed in his firſt Book of Preternatural Tumors, and Chap. 43. doth his endeavor to ſalve and anſwer theſe objections, whiles he thus writeth; <hi>The Blood</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if it altogether leaveth its own proper Veſſels, and caſt it ſelf forth into a greater</hi> Venter <hi>or Cavity, being left deſtitute of the influx of the heat that ſhould flow in unto it, wil neceſſarily putrefie: but in</hi> Aneuryſma <hi>(which proceedeth from the opening of an Artery) it is not ſo far forth left deſtitute by the heat thereof, and by the reſt of the Blood that is contained therein, that its native heat and colour ſhould periſh; neither is it expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth into any great ſpace or</hi> Venter, <hi>that it ſhould corrupt and putrefie. For it is cheriſhed by the vital ſpirits contained in the Artery, ſince that its matter remaineth yet entire and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For albeit the Artery be divided, and the Blood cauſing the Tumor doth paſs forth; yet notwithſtanding the Fleſh and the Skin that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Artery, continuing ſtil whol and entire it doth not alwaies ſo inſinuate it ſelf into any large and ample ſpace, that it ſhould be made thereby to putrefie, and rendered deſtitute of the help and aſſiſtance of Nature.</hi> But the truth is, he doth not here by all that he alleadgeth acquit and free the Ancients from the aforeſaid Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For if the Blood that is flown forth may be cheriſhed by the vital Spirits and the heat of the Artery; why then is not the ſame done like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when a Vein is ſmitten and pierced through, and when the Blood (the Vein being not as yet conſolidated and exactly cloſed) iſſueth and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth forth? Neither doth the Blood only then putrefie when it is poured forth into a large and ſenſible Cavity, but likewiſe whenſoever it is ſhed forth under the Skin. Furthermore (as we have ſaid) that Blood which we call Arterial is not poured forth round about, as the Vein Blood is; which yet notwithſtanding it ought much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do, in regard that it is thinner, and more ſpiritful. For it is not ſufficient (what <hi>Plate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> writeth) that the Blood poured forth under the Skin doth there form and frame for it ſelf a <hi>Sinus</hi> or hollow nook, not unlike the hollow ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into which the Arteries in the thick Membrane of the Brain do inſinuate themſelves; and that the Skin is inſtead of an Artery unto that Blood that is poured forth out of the Artery; and that the Blood may from thence uninterruptedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and flow back again into the Artery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Corruption. For the <hi>Sinus</hi>'s are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Nature, and ſo exactly ſhut up with Membranes, that nothing at all can poſſibly flow forth of them. But now the Arterial blood can no manner of way frame for it ſelf any ſuch <hi>Sinus,</hi> but whenſoever it falleth forth without the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it diffuſeth it ſelf every where round about; and in regard that under the Skin all things are confluid, therefore the Blood eaſily maketh an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into the adjacent parts by that way and paſſage that is opened; the which we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſee the Veiny Blood to do (which is much thicker) and then the ſaid Blood being out of its own, and in a ſtrange place, ſoon putrefieth. Which appeareth even from that very Hiſtory that <hi>Antonius Saporta</hi> writeth, as conceiving it to make much for the confirmation of what he had written touching <hi>Aneuryſma,</hi> in his firſt Book of preternatural Tumors, and Chap. 43. Neither in truth was that Diſeaſe which he there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth an <hi>Aneuryſma,</hi> but only an effuſion of the Arterial Blood, upon the rupture of the Artery, into the places lying neer about it, and there cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting. But this is the Story that he telleth us. <hi>Whenas</hi> Johannes Fabri <hi>that moſt acute and ſedulous Scribe of the Palace</hi> at Montpelier <hi>had ſpent the chiefeſt part of his youth in riotous and inordinate Revellings and Feaſtings, and in a frequent and unſeaſonable Drinking of the
<pb n="2531" facs="tcp:49110:71"/> ſtrongeſt ſort of Wines, without any diluting, or qualifying the heat thereof, he began about the fiftieth yeer of his age to draw his breath with much difficulty, and to be affected with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream troubleſome palpitation and beating of his Heart. For the removal of this great Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per there were many Remedies preſcribed and adminiſtred, not only by my ſelf, but likewiſe by the moſt expert Phyſitians of our Vniverſity there. All which when they could not in the leaſt prevail over this contumacious and head-ſtrong Diſeaſe, by reaſon of the Patients continuing and perſevering in his accuſtomed ill courſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, he grew the worſe thereby; and after ſome few months were paſſed, in the which by the advice of the Phyſitians he took no Phyſick at all (for they were willing to commit unto Nature a part of the Cure of this Chronical Affect) he began to complain of that part that lieth under his left Shoulder-blade. The place of his grief being lookt upon, and throughly conſidered, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto me a notable Tumor, ſoft unto the touch, and attended with a beating; and when preſſed down with the Fingers, it was then ſeemingly wholly hid and non-apparent; but theſe were no ſooner taken off, but forthwith it returneth as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In ſhort, the Diſeaſe having gotten deep roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp; being now become incurable, our Patient within a very ſhort time after departed this life. But now that we might get the truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty both of the nature and conſtitution of this Diſeaſe, as alſo of the Cauſe thereof, we diſſected that part that was affected with the Tumor; out of which there iſſued forth great ſtore of Blood, unſavory and ſtinking as it was; all which Blood being wholly evacuated and throughly cleanſed, there appeared the prime and principle Artery under the Heart (having its original from the great Vein in its aſcending up into the Head) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly dilated, and extreamly torn. This Vein deſcending downward creepeth along through the Region of the Intercoſtal Muſcles; the Blood that flowed forth of it being heaped up in the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Muſcles, and in tract of time putrefying and corrupting, had ſo vitiated and marred the Vertebra and Rib of that place, that it ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us altogether rotten and putrefied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore (ſay we) ſome other way and means of the generating of this Tumor is to be ſought and found out.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the Book of the Medicin. Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions defineth <hi>Aneuryſma</hi> by the relaxation of an Artery. And ſo likewiſe <hi>Fernelius</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Book of his Patholog, and Chap. 3. aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that <hi>Aneuryſma</hi> is a dilatation of an Artery ful of ſpiritful blood: but all this while they do not expreſs the manner how this is done. Neither is it ever a whit credible that <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> is cauſed by the dilating of both the Tunicles of the Artery, but only by the widening of one of them. For the Atteries have indeed a double Membrane, one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, which is ſlender, thin, and ſoft, having of ſtraight Fibres very many, but of oblique ones very few, and of tranſverſe ones none at all: the other internal, which is cloſe, thick, and hard, having tranſverſe Fibres, but wanting ſtraight and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ones. And therefore if the Internal Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle be either broken by extenſion (as eaſily it may be in regard of its hardneſs) or elſe if it be opened by Section, it doth not eaſily Cement and cloſe together again, becauſe it is hard; but now the external Tunicle in regard of its ſoftneſs doth eaſily and ſoon grow together again; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo ſoft, and wanteth both oblique and tranſverſe Fibres, it is thereupon extended by the Blood and the vital Spirit, ſeeking their paſſage forth in an imperious and violent manner; and ſo this kind of Tumor cometh to be excited; in the which the force and the impetuous violence of the blood and the vital ſpirit may be diſcovered by the very touch. Neither is that which <hi>Platerus</hi> objecteth of any weight or moment; to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, when he tels us, that upon the alone bare Section that he ſaw made in the skin that covered over the Tumor, the blood forthwith at firſt hid it ſelf, but then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſprang forth amain; and this oftentimes, ſaith he, is in ſo great abundance, that it cannot by any one (uſe he what means he wil) be any more ſtanched; but that it iſſueth forth in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abundance, inſomuch that the whol ſtock of Blood being almoſt ſpent it hath oftentimes brought a ſudden Death upon the ſick Perſon. But indeed if we ſhould determine that the <hi>Aneuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> proceedeth from the dilatation of theſe Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Artery, this Objection would then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſome weight along with it. But in regard that (according to the truth of the matter) we have already aſſerted and determined that an <hi>Aneuryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> ariſeth from the dilatation of the exterior Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle alone of the Artery (the internal being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned either by Section, or by Rupture) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore by any means grant, that the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial blood lieth hid under the whole Skin: but becauſe the external Tunicle is extraordinarily extended, it cohereth and ſticketh ſo cloſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Skin, that it is extended together with it, and is in a manner ſo become one therewith, that it is almoſt impoſſible to cut the Skin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cutting the external Tunicle of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
                  <p>And ſo then the reſult of al that hath been ſaid wil be this, to wit,<note place="margin">The nigheſt cauſe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuriſma.</hi>
                     </note> That the proxime and nigheſt cauſe of <hi>Aneuryſma</hi> is, the opening of the interior Tunicle of the Artery, and the dilatation of the external. Now it is very frequently opened by Section, when unexpert Chirurgeons inſtead of a Vein open an Artery; or when at leaſt together with the Vein they cut through the Artery that lieth under it. Now if this at any time happen, the external Tunicle in regard of its ſoftneſs and neer alliance with the
<pb n="2532" facs="tcp:49110:72"/> Tunicles of the Veins very eaſily and ſoon cloſeth together again; but the interior (by reaſon of its hardneſs) remaineth open; from whence through the patent and open place the Blood and vital Spirit endeavoreth to break forth, and by this means diſtendeth the external Tunicle, and cauſeth this kind of Tumor. The ſame may likewiſe happen if the internal Tunicle of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery be broken either by the violent and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motion of the Arterial blood, or by any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent external cauſe, and the overgreat diſtenſion of the Artery; the external Tunicle (that is more apt for extenſion) being al this while ſafe and ſound.</p>
                  <p>But now, Whether or no that pulſation of the Arteries, of which <hi>Platerus</hi> maketh mention in his Tract touching the palpitation of the Heart, (and touching which out of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> and <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus Mercatus,</hi> we have already treated in the fourth Book of our Practice, Part 2. Sect. 3. Chap. 9.) may or ought properly to be referred unto <hi>Aneuryſma,</hi> I very much doubt. For whenas the Membrane of either Artery is then whol and entire, it ſeemeth rather to be an Affect in the Veins, of kin to the ſwoln and diſtorted Veins that we cal <hi>Varices,</hi> than this Tumor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuryſma,</hi> of which we are now treating.</p>

For the Tumor being opened, and the Artery (as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) being cut, the Arterial blood floweth forth (together with the vital ſpirit) abundantly, al as it were at once, and with great violence; ſo that the ſick perſon is oftentimes precipitated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extream hazard and danger of death.

Now as for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of cutting the <hi>Aneuryſma, Aegineta</hi> acquaints us with it in his ſixth Book of Phyſick, Chap. 37. in theſe words: <hi>If the Tumor</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by opening, then we uſe to inflict upon the skin a ſtraight Section made longwaies; and then after this the lips of the skin being parted and far ſundred by little hooks, we make bare the Artery, ſevering it from its Membranes by Inſtruments very fit for this purpoſe; and then after the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a Needle under it, we tie it with two threds; and then ſo ſoon as we have pricked with a Pen-knife the middle part of the Artery, and have evacuated what was therein contained, we then betake our ſelf unto the ſuppurative cure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at length the ties of the threds fal off. But now if the dilatation be cauſed from the rupture of an Artery, then it behoveth us (as far forth as poſſibly we can) to lay hold upon the whol with our fingers, together with the skin: then to caſt through it (beneath that we have laid hold on with the fingers) a Needle, that may (if you pleaſe) have in it two threds or rather one thred doubled: and after the caſting through of the Needle and thred, we are then to cut in two the every bandle (as I may ſo cal it) of the double thred, and ſo to bind about the Tumor (on this ſide, and on that) with the two threds. But if there be any cauſe to fear leſt theſe threds ſhould ſlip and fail, then in this caſe there is likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Needle to be caſt through, that may throughout lie and preſs upon the former, and this Needle may likewiſe draw after it two threds, or a double thred; and the handle thereof being cut in ſunder we then bind about the Tumor with four threds, or elſe the Tumor being opened about the midſt of it, after the emptying forth of what is therein contained, we cut off the skin, that being left remaining that was tied about; and then a long ſpleen-like Plaiſter wel moiſtened in Wine and Oyl being laid thereon, we conclude and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Cure by Liniments.</hi> But who is he that ſeeth not, that this kind of Cure is not only cruel, and ſo cruel that few or none wil ſubmit unto it; but that it hath likewiſe much danger in it, and yet for al that doth not heal the ſick perſon? For although the Artery be bound about; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding after the threds are looſened there is cauſe to fear, leſt that either an Haemorrhage fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or elſe that a new <hi>Aneuryſma</hi> be cauſed. And therefore the more ſecure and ſafe courſe is, only to bind hard and preſs together the Tumor with Bands and Medicaments, that ſo it may not gain any further augmentation.</p>

                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>They are generated from great ſtore of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly blood, which (as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth in his Book of black Choler, Chap. 4.) Nature often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tranſmitteth unto thoſe Veins that are in the Thighs, by the which being diſtended and dilated they are rendred <hi>Varicoſe</hi> or ſwoln up; and the skin that toucheth upon theſe kind of Veins in proceſs of time becometh of a blackiſh color. But now as for ſuch in whom there is only great ſtore of blood flowing in that is not Melancholy; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting indeed, and wholly relying upon thoſe Veins which there in that place are naturally more weak than elſwhere, doth dilate them, but ſcarcely even dye them of ſuch a like color, as it happeneth when Melancholy blood ſhal produce theſe <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> For ſuch are in very great danger (if any one aſſay to cut forth the Veins affected) of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2534" facs="tcp:49110:73"/> ſurpriſed with Melancholly. For this is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen to happen, not only in <hi>Varices,</hi> but even in the Haemorrhoids alſo that conſiſt of the ſame kind of humor, even as the coming of them upon thoſe that are mad is wont to be a freeing and diſcharging of them from their madneſs; as <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> in the ſixth of his Aphoriſms, Aphor. 21. And yet notwithſtanding, ſcarcely ever doth good blood (though it abound never ſo much) by its great plenty alone produce and cauſe <hi>Varices,</hi> as it doth if it be both plentiful, and withall if it be thick; which by its weight tendeth downward unto the Thight. Whereupon it is alſo that the <hi>Varices</hi> have not their being until the ripeneſs of age; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in <hi>Coac. praenot.</hi> toward the end teacheth us; in regard that a thick and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly blood is not generated ſooner in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And likewiſe <hi>Pliny</hi> in his eleventh Book and Chap. 45. writeth that the <hi>Varices</hi> happen in the Thighs of Men only, and very rarely in Women. Such likewiſe as are bald, in theſe the <hi>Varices</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not great: but for ſuch as (while their baldneſs is upon them) are afflicted with theſe <hi>Varices,</hi> theſe come again to receive their Hair; <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> in the ſixth of his Aphoriſms, Aphor. 34. Which yet notwithſtanding <hi>Galen</hi> aſſerteth to be a falſhood (in his Comment) unleſs haply any one wil underſtand this of that affect that Phyſitians call <hi>Madaroſis,</hi> that is, the ſhedding or falling off of the Hair. For this Affect ſince that it hath its original from vitious humors (as likewiſe the <hi>Alopecia</hi> hath, and alſo that we call <hi>Ophiaſis</hi>) if thoſe very depraved humors being tranſlated into the Thighs do cauſe the <hi>Varices,</hi> the ſick Perſons may then poſſibly recover and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Hair again. For if at the firſt the loſs of the Hair proceeded from vitious humors their corrupting and corroding the very roots of the Hair; then (queſtionleſs) theſe ſaid humors taking now their courſe into ſome other place, the Hairs will again return unto their naturall State.</p>
                     <p>The more remote Cauſes all thoſe that make for then generating and breeding of thick and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly blood; and eſpecially the Spleen when it is diſtempered maketh much unto, and helpeth forward the generation of theſe <hi>Varices.</hi> And that likewiſe which much furthereth the flowing of the aforeſaid humors unto this part, may be compriſed under on of theſe Heads, to wit, either a blow, or ſtreining overmuch, long and tedious foot jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, extream hard labor, and the like.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>Unleſs therefore the <hi>Varices</hi> be of the biggeſt ſize, and that the Veins and the Skin by reaſon of their extenſion be ſo extenuated that there be great cauſe to fear a Rupture, a profuſion of blood, and Death it ſelf; and again unleſs they be inflamed, and extreamly painful; or that there be preſent ſome great and malignant Ulcer; they are by no means to be healed, leſt that theſe being removed, ſome more grievous Evils befall: Since that thoſe things only may be ſaid to heal that do altogether free the Party; and not thoſe things that generate another Affect more dangerous then the former; as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us, in the ſixth of his Aphoriſms, Aphor. 26.</p>
                     <p>And therefore if it like you to Cure theſe <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rices,</hi> this ought to be done with great Caution; there muſt be ſome of the blood let forth; the Body muſt then be purged, and that not only once, but twice or thrice; and whatſoever is amiſs in the Liver and the Spleen (if they be ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and adminiſter cauſe unto the <hi>Varices</hi>) is firſt of al to be corrected. And afterward we are to make uſe of Aſtringent, Drying, and Digeſtive Medicaments; as alſo of Swath-bands, and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that may thruſt forth the blood from the inferior parts unto the ſuperior.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things if they profit not, but prove ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsleſs, the Ancients were then wont to betake themſelves unto Section or Cutting. <hi>Oppius</hi> is our Author (as <hi>Pliny</hi> relateth it in his eleventh Book, and Chap. 45,) that <hi>Caius Marius</hi> (who had been ſeven times Conſul) was the one man that ſtanding ſuffered theſe <hi>Varices</hi> to be taken out of him; the one man (ſaith he) I cal him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="2535" facs="tcp:49110:73"/> that as he was the firſt, ſo he was the only man in thoſe times. But after him there were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo that ſuffered the ſame to be done unto them ſtanding, and even without any bonds. For ſo <hi>Cicero</hi> tels us in the ſecond Book of his Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culane Queſtions, towards the end thereof. <hi>But in good truth</hi> (ſaith he) Caius Marius, <hi>a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man (but yet a man every inch of him) when he was cut of the</hi> Varices, <hi>at the very firſt forbid them to bind him: Neither before</hi> Marius <hi>was there ever any heard of that was cut without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound. Why therefore were others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? His Authority and Example cauſed it ſo to be. Seeſt thou not therefore that the Evil of this Affect was more in Opinion, then it was really, and in Nature. And yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Affect was not without its ſharp bite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain, the ſame</hi> Marius <hi>ſheweth: for he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up only one Thigh (whereas they were both of them affected) to be cut, and not his other Thigh that ailed altogether as much; ſo that he as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved man was contented to ſuffer pain, but then as a Rational Man he refuſed to undergo a greater pain then there was neceſſary Cauſe for: the whole of what thou art taught by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conſiſts in this,</hi> viz. <hi>that thou carry a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power over thy ſelf. And of the ſame thing</hi> Plutarch <hi>writeth in the life of</hi> Caius Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: He may be for an example unto us (<hi>ſaith</hi> Plutarch) <hi>in that when he was diſeaſed in both his Thighs, and having them bothful of theſe</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rices, <hi>and bearing the deformity of them with a very ill will, he took unto him a Phyſitian for the curing of one Thigh only; in the cutting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he did not ſo much as blinch, or once ſtir his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, neither was he heard ſo much as once to ſigh; but when in ſilence, and with fixed Eyes he had rendred himſelf to be cut, he was not at all affraid (during the time this cutting took up) to ſuffer and undergo certain intervals of pains cauſed by pauſes and delaies. But yet he would not in the leaſt conſent unto the Phyſitian requiring him to render &amp; yield up his other thigh to be cured; but thus he ſaid, I know wel that the Remedy can no waies countervail theſe ſo great pains. And haply theſe are thoſe things, of which</hi> Seneca <hi>in his eleventh Book, Epiſt.</hi> 79. <hi>ſaith;</hi> He, that whileſt he was ſuffering thoſe <hi>Varices</hi> to be cut forth continued al the while rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a Book. <hi>But yet at this day there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any one that wil admit of this Remedy, for the removal of that deformity that is cauſed by theſe</hi> Varices. <hi>As for the manner of cutting them out,</hi> Paulus Aegineta, <hi>in his Book</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 82. <hi>teacheth us how it ought to be performed. The man being waſhed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and a ſtring tied about on the upper part of his Thigh, we command him then to walk; and then when the Vein is filled ful, with writing ink or with a Colliry we mark it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its ſcituation, the length of three fingers, or ſomewhat more; the man being then laid upon his back with his Thighs extended, we then bind about another String above the Knee, and by this means the Vein being elevated into a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable heighth, we cut with a Panknife in that very place which we marked, no deeper then only through the Skin, that ſo we may by no means di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Vein; and then the Lips of the Section being diſtended with little hooks, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes being excoriated and fleyed off by thoſe crooked Penknives that are provided in Watery Ruptures, and the Vein being altogether made bare and naked, and laid open to the view on all ſides, we then looſen the Thighbands; and the Veſſel being elevated by a little hook, we caſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it a Needle drawing along in it a double Thread, and cut in two the nook of the Thread; and then (the Vein being divided in the midſt by a Veneſectory Penknife) we evacuate and let forth as much of the blood as is needful: then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, with one of the threads we tie cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the upper part of the Veſſel, and the Thigh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extended ſtraight forth, by the expreſſion or hard preſſing of the Hands we empty forth that blood that is in the Thigh: and afterwards we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain beneath tie the veſſel cloſe together; or we cut off and take quite away that part of the Vein that lieth between the bonds, or otherwiſe we permit it to remain, until that at length together with the bonds it fal out of its own accord: &amp; then putting in dry Liniments, and a long ſpleen-like Emplaſter after it hath been throughly moyſtened in Wine &amp; Oyl being laid thereupon, we bind it down cloſe, and ſo we cure it by the continued courſe of ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Medicaments, that are to be adminiſtred and applied in the nature, and after the manner of Liniments. Neither am I ignorant, that ſome of the Ancients uſed none of theſe bonds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures; for ſome of them preſently cut forth the Veſſel ſo ſoon as ever they had made it naked and bare; and certain others of them with violence draw forth and break off the ſaid Veſſel, ſo ſoon as they have extended it from the bottom. But the truth is, that before mentioned way of Manual operation is abſolutely the beſt, and of all other the moſt ſecure. Moreover, as for the</hi> Varices <hi>that conſiſt in the bottom of the Belly, we handle them in like manner; as likewiſe thoſe that conſiſt in the Temples.</hi> Thus far <hi>Aegineta.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cornel. Celſus</hi> in his ſeventh Book and Chap. 31. telleth us of a twofold manner and Method of curing theſe <hi>Varices</hi> by Chirurgery, when he thus writeth; Every Vein (ſaith he) that is hurtful either withereth and waſteth away upon its being burnt, or elſe it is cut forth with the hand. If it be ſtraight, or if though it be tranſverſe, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding if it be ſimple; or elſe thirdly, if it be not overgreat, it is the better burnt. If it be crooked, and be as it were implicated into certain Orbs, ſo that many of them are as it were invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and folded one within the other, it is then more convenient to take them forth. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of burning is this. The Skin having firſt an
<pb n="2536" facs="tcp:49110:74"/> inciſion made upon it, then the diſcovered Vein is to be a little preſſed with a thin and blunt piece of Iron heated red hot; and great care muſt be had leſt that the ſides of the orifice it ſelf be burnt, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> to draw back again with ſmal hooks wil be no very hard matter. This is to be done by interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing welnigh four fingers in a rank throughout the whol <hi>Varix;</hi> and then there is to be impoſed thereon ſuch a Medicament whereby thoſe things that are burnt may be healed. But then it is to be cut forth after this manner. The Skin (like as before) having an inciſion made in it upon the Vein, the orifice is to be kept open with a little hook, and with a penknife the Vein is to be drawn a little and looſened from the body; and here great care muſt be taken leſt that in the doing of what went before the Vein it ſelf receive any hurt: and under it a blunted hook is to be caſt, and there being interpoſed almoſt the ſame diſtance as we ſhewed you above, in the ſame Vein there is the very ſame thing to be done as aboveſaid; which ſaid Vein whither it tendeth, is eaſily known by the extended hook. And ſo ſoon as the ſame hath been done whereſoever the <hi>Varices</hi> are, the Vein being brought unto ſome one place by the hook is there to be cut off; and then after this, in that place where the little hook is next unto it, it is there to be drawn forth, and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it is to be cut off. And ſo the Thigh being on al ſides freed from the <hi>Varices,</hi> then the mouths and orifices of the inciſions are to be united, and ſtrictly cloſed together, and upon the ſame there is to be impoſed a conglutinating Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Avicen</hi> (Book 3. Fen. 17. Tr. 1. Chap. 18.) cutteth the Skin until the <hi>Varix</hi> appeareth, and this he doth indeed longwaies, and not ei her obliquely or tranſverſly: and then he extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth and draweth forth al the blood that is in it; and then he cleanſeth it by cutting it in length. But ſomtimes (as he writeth) it is to be drawn forth with a Needle, and ſo to be cut. He addeth moreover, that a drawing of it out with a Cautery is better than the cutting of it forth.</p>
                     <p>But in regard that the Cure of <hi>Varices</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion or cutting forth is not only rough and very difficult, but alſo becauſe that for the moſt part it is not attended with an happy ſucceſs, by reaſon of the flux and effuſion of blood that hindereth the operation; therefore <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente,</hi> in his Treatiſe of Chirurgical Operations, teacheth us how we may cure theſe <hi>Varices</hi> in another manner, that is far better, to wit, without the extraction and drawing them out; on this wiſe. <hi>Since that there are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>three things to be conſidered that concur unto the conſtituting of</hi> Varices, <hi>viz. The Blood that floweth, The Flux thereof, And the Dilatation of the Vein; therefore there are three things like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that are ſhewn and pointed out hereby; to wit, That the flowing Blood is to be intercepted, That which is already flown in to be evacuated, And the widened Vein to be ſtreightened and made narrower. For the intercepting of the courſe of the blood, in the beginning and the end of the</hi> Varix, <hi>we ought to caſt a bond and tie upon it; which is done either by that we cal</hi> Sella re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curvata, <hi>or by a Hook, or by laying hold upon the vein with the top of two fingers, and lifting it up thereby, and then tranſmitting a needle draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thread along with it through the lower part of the vein, and there tied together: upon which part the skin is to be cut, that ſo the vein may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and may be tied; and it is not to be cut when it hangeth forth unto the external parts. We might likewiſe adminiſter the ſame means, and uſe the very ſame way to intercept the blood, that Farriers uſe in intercepting the blood in Horſes, that is, to preſs the Vein cloſe together with a little thin Iron Plate faſtened unto the Vein with a pair of Tongs. But then for the Evacuation of the blood that hath already flown in,</hi> Hippocrates <hi>in his Book of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, about the end thereof, teacheth us how and in what manner this is to be done. In the place alleadged he giveth in charge, that the Varicoſe or ſwoln vein be not cut with any great and wide g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſh leſt that thereby a great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer be cauſed, by reaſon of the influx of the</hi> Varix; <hi>but rather (as</hi> Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates <hi>ſaith) the</hi> Varix <hi>it ſelf is again and again to be pricked whenſoever we have any opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſhal find is to be fit; from which ſaid prickings the blood that hath already flown in, and filleth the ſwoln Vein, is evacuated and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied forth; and this is done by degrees, and by little and little; and not al at once, and on a huddle as it were, and with much danger unto the Patient. But however, it is evacuated, if not wholly, yet at leaſt ſo much thereof (even to the greater part of it) that the vein may withal likewiſe ſink and fal down in ſome one part or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This being accompliſhed, we come then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third and laſt ſcope, that is, the aſtriction and ſtreightening of the dilated and over widen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vein. For my own part I am wont to make up a Medicament of Tragacanths macerated in the Wine of Pomegranates, or the juyce of unripe Grapes; and then after this, I add the Pouder of Bole-armenick, Maſtick, and Dragons blood, in equal portions, until the Tragacanths being melted or ſoftened become as thick as Wax, ſo that in the hollow of the Hand they may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto the ſhape and form of a Candle: which being done, I put the Medicament longwaies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the</hi> Varices, <hi>and above upon it the rind of a Reed, that by its Cavity may anſwer unto the Convexity of the Medicament, and that may the better keep down the Medicament: it is to be laid on in the length of it, and to be tied about the Thigh with bonds, or elſe with a narrow Swath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: for ſo both by this compreſſion of the Swathband, as alſo by the aſtriction of the Reed,
<pb n="2537" facs="tcp:49110:74"/> and the Medicament, the</hi> Varices <hi>have been often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſtreightened and cloſe bound, that they have ſeem'd even to conſume and wither away. I have now and then likewiſe made uſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed Juyce of</hi> Hypociſtis <hi>or the excreſcence of the Plant</hi> Cyſtus. <hi>And laſtly, I have ſomtimes made uſe of a more mild and yet more gentle kind of Chirurgery, and eſpecially when the</hi> Varix <hi>hath been but ſmal and inconſiderable. For lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide the Ligaments, and the compunctions or prickings of</hi> Hippocrates, <hi>I made uſe only of the Medicament before mentioned, according to the length of the</hi> Varix, <hi>and binding it down with a part of the Reed tied faſt thereupon; or elſe a Spunge ſomwhat long and writhed, and of the thickneſs of the</hi> Varix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>bound about with a thred, and moiſtened in the juyce of Pomegranates, or of Hypociſtis, and then rightly tied and bound on with a narrow Swathband: and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe very beneficial likewiſe are the unripe fruits of the Wood</hi> Guajacum <hi>wel bruiſed, and impoſed; all which by their aſtriction do intercept the blood, and bind the veins together, and by their much dying they likewiſe evacuate. And laſtly, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the part, I made uſe of a hoſe or buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin made of a dogs skin, which was to be put on, and exactly faſtened on about the Thigh.</hi> Thus <hi>Fabricius.</hi>

                        <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius,</hi> in his fourth Cent. Obſerv. 85. relateth a Hiſtory; as alſo the Cure of a monſtrous <hi>Varix.</hi> The ſtory is this: There was (ſaith he) a certain extraordinary ſtrong man who had in his left Leg a malignant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate great Ulcer, together with a <hi>Varix</hi> of a vaſt magnitude. For in thickneſs it was equal unto that part of the Arm that is next unto the Wriſt; and it was welnigh a ſpan long. Now it began in the very Ham, and deſcending toward the Foot it made a Ring, and two Circumvoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But that which was here worthy of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, was this, That ſo ſoon as ever the man lift up his Leg any thing high, forthwith the blood drew back; and no ſooner did he put it again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, but it again deſcended, and that in an inſtant and moment. And (in ſhort) the blood did ebb and flow no otherwiſe than as if it had out of ſome narrow pipe been caſt forth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into this, and ſomtimes into that part. As for the Cure, he thus proceeded in it: Having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto the Patient a fit courſe of Diet, and ſeveral times likewiſe purged his body, and having alſo opened a Vein in the Arm of the ſame ſide, he placed the ſick perſon upon a Bench, and then in the very Ham he gently ſeparated the Skin from the Vein it ſelf. Then with a thread twice doubled, and put into the Eye of a crooked Needle, he woond about the <hi>Varix;</hi> and in the lower part of the <hi>Varix</hi> he proceeded in the very ſame manner. But before he tied the thread, and made faſt the knot, he cauſed his Leg to be taken off the Bench and ſet upon the ground; and this he did, to the end that the blood (according to its cuſtom) might flow downward. At length he firſt of al tied the thred hard in the upper part of the <hi>Varix,</hi> and then he faſtened it with a knot; thus he did afterward likewiſe in the lower part. This being done, with a Penknife he maketh an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the almoſt uppermoſt part of the <hi>Varix,</hi> that ſo the blood that was contained in the <hi>Varix,</hi> as in a long and little bag, might the better flow unto it. But when the flux of blood proved to be greater than what was proportionable unto the greatneſs of the <hi>Varix,</hi> and that he attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and exactly viewed the place, there was found a blind paſſage, which from out of the lower part of the Ligature entered into the <hi>Varix.</hi> This paſſage whenas it could not be tied with a thread, he firſt applied unto the entrance thereof ſome of the Eſcharotick Unguent; and after that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in great abundance his own Pouder toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the white of an Egg, for the ſtanching of the blood flowing from it; and al theſe things he bound faſt on with a Swathband throughly moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened and wet in <hi>Oxycrate;</hi> and thus he left it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven until the day following. At length he cured the Wounds that himſelf had made, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of others. And ſo this man (by Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſiſtance) became perfectly whol and ſound.</p>

Of this <hi>Elephantia Avicen</hi> treateth in his third Book, Fen. 22. Tract. 1. Chap. 18. where he likewiſe handleth <hi>Varices; Rhaſes</hi> in his ninth Book to <hi>Almanſor,</hi> Chap. 93.

But now whereas we have in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſpoken of the augmentation of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the whol body, and in general (above Chap. 4.) thoſe things therefore which may in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral be further ſpoken of the Atrophy, we think it, nor amiſs to ſubjoyn them here in this place.</p>
                  <p>When the Body is not nouriſhed ſo much as it ought to be,<note place="margin">Certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophy.</note> but is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed and leſſened by reaſon of the denying of food unto it, this may indeed in the general be called an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophy. But yet notwithſtanding the peculiar Species of an Atrophy have likewiſe their peculiar names.

                  <p>But now an Atrophy is twofold;<note place="margin">Atrophy in general what it is.</note> the firſt is of the whol Body; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſome one particular part, as of the Arm, the Foot, &amp;c. The Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the whole (in general ſo taken) is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural extenuation of the whole Body, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its being fruſtrated of its food, and its being denied its due and requiſite Nutrition.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>As touching the Cauſes of an Atrophy, this in the firſt place is to be taken notice of, viz. that the Cauſe that invadeth the whole body is either in its own quality and diſpoſition according to Nature, or elſe it is preternatural. And then likewiſe that which is Natural, or according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the <hi>Maraſmus</hi> (as we cal it) in old age, and in aged Perſons. For there was never yet that living Creature born, or brought forth, than was not obnoxious to old age, and which in old
<pb n="2540" facs="tcp:49110:76"/> age did not wither and conſume away. But ſince that this Atrophy cannot by any Art whatſoever be prevented; we wil therefore in this place ſpeak on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that Atrophy which happeneth preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unto ſome Bodies alone, and not unto all in general.</p>

                           <hi>1.</hi> By reaſon of the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment.</note> to wit, Nutriment, and the nouriſhing faculty; in both theſe likewiſe the Cauſe of Nutrition diminiſhed (and conſequently of an Atrophy) is to be ſought after. In regard of the Aliment, the body conſumeth and waſteth away, by reaſon of its either defect, or vitious quality, which we may cal its pravity. For if there be not dayly as much of this Aliment again taken into the body, as is every day inſenſibly diſcuſſed, then the body waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But if there be indeed a ſufficient ſtore and ſtock of blood treaſured up in the Veins; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this is vitious and naught: and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is not at all attracted by the parts; or if it be attracted, yet can it not be aſſimilated. The body is extenuated and pineth away, in the defect and want of Food and Nutriment, when in place of that Subſtance that is dayly waſted and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by an inſenſible tranſpiration, and exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, there is no other Nutriment, or at leaſt not a ſufficient ſtore thereof, ſubſtituted and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Now whereas the blood is the proxime and nigheſt Nutriment of the whole body; there the Nutrition is eſpecially hurt through the defect and failing of the blood. Now the blood faileth (firſt of all) in regard of ſome default and error in the firſt Concoction; when there is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of Chyle (from whence the blood ought to have its original) generated and bred in the Stomack: and this may happen unto ſuch as are ſound and in perfect health, by reaſon of a dayly and continued ſcarceneſs of Food, and their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſpare Diet; but it happeneth in ſuch as are ſick and unhealthy, when by reaſon of the want of appetite (it being now much dejected and weakned) they are averſe from all kind of Food, and refuſe to make any; or elſe when by reaſon of their Diſeaſe they are fed with but little Food, and that likewiſe not much nouriſhing. Which may alſo happen, if the Food that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in be preſently ſent and driven down into the Guts (either Crude or Raw, or elſe turn'd into Chyle) and ſo is by the Belly ejected, without its ever coming unto the Liver. The ſame may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe happen if (by reaſon of any Diſeaſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in the Stomack, its Concoction being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much weakned) the Chyle that is generated be either but little in quantity, or (that which is as bad or worſe) imperfect and not ſufficiently elaborated. Moreover Nutrition may be hindred becauſe of the hurt of the ſanguifying faculty, to wit, when by reaſon of ſomething amiſs in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Spleen, the blood that is generated is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, and not good: and this cometh to paſs in the <hi>Cachexy, Leucophlegmatia, Tympany,</hi> the Dropſie <hi>Aſcites,</hi> the <hi>Scorbutick</hi> atrophy, and the long laſting Scabbineſs. Now as for the Cauſes of Sanguification, they have been already (in the third Book of our Pract.) mentioned and explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. From whence it happeneth, that albeit there be a ſufficient quantity of Food taken into the body, yet notwithſtanding there followeth no Nutrition; and this again happeneth for two Cauſes, to wit, becauſe either there is no aliment appointed by Nature for the nouriſhing of the parts; or if there be any appointed for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yet notwithſtanding it cannot be rightly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilated. There is no aliment appointed unto the parts, either becauſe the Chyle is not ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elaborated in the Stomack that it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into good blood; or elſe, becauſe although the Chyle be ſufficiently and rightly elaborated in the Stomack, yet by reaſon of ſome fault in the Liver it is not converted into good blood; or elſe becauſe, that although there be Chyle generated in the Stomack, and that accordingly blood be bred in the Liver; yet it is oftentimes diſcuſſed and waſted by ſome certain Cauſes; ſuch as are overmuch exerciſe, Watchings, Cares, Griefs, and Diſeaſes, which melt away, diſſolve, and diſcuſs the aliment; ſo that there is too great an evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof by the Belly, by Sweats, and by the flux of Blood; and ſuch likewiſe are, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Reſt, Meats and Medicamens that dry exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, Fevers, eſpecially ſuch of them as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and Malignant. But the Nutriment is not rightly aſſimilated by the parts, in regard of ſome vitious quality it hath in it, by reaſon of which it cannot be aſſimilated by the parts; and ſo likewiſe the Nutrition may be fruſtrated by ſome external error; or elſe by reaſon of the Object, to wit, becauſe the Blood is ſuch that it cannot by the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing faculty be perfectly overcome and aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>But now in regard of the faculty, there is not a ſufficient Nutrition,<note place="margin">

In regard of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty.</note> by reaſon of ſome defect and want of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat, and radical moyſture. For Nature maketh great uſe of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat, as of the next inſtrument in nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And this eſpecially happeneth by reaſon of the preternatural affects of the Heart, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally its heat and drineſs; whether it be that the Heart be primarily affected (as it is in the Hectick Fever) or elſe that it ſuffer through ſome default of the neighboring parts, as it happeneth in the Ulcer of the Lungs. For whereas the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing faculty (as we ſaid erewhile) maketh great uſe of the innate and Native heat (as its principal Inſtrument) in reteining, Concocting, agglutinating, and aſſimilating, and it being ſo that the innate heat is cheriſhed by the heat that floweth in; if the temper of the Heart be not right, and as it ought to be, then the heat that floweth
<pb n="2541" facs="tcp:49110:76"/> in, and conſequently the innate heat likewiſe wil be much amiſs, and not rightly tempered; and ſo it can be no fit Inſtrument of the nouriſhing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. And that that Hectick Feavers do but ſlowly and ſenſibly bring to paſs, this the burning and melting Feavers accompliſh in a very ſhort time; by the heat whereof not only the aliment and ſubſtance of the body is conſumed and melted away, but likewiſe the temperament both of the Heart, and alſo of the whol body is converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which is more hot and dry. The ſame happeneth by reaſon of over hard labors, cares, long continued diſeaſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in general, al cauſes that are able to conſume the Radical moiſture, and weaken the Native heat.</p>
                     <p>Now this Atrophy happeneth eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the ſofter parts,<note place="margin">The ſubject:</note> the fat and the fleſh; and indeed the fat is firſt of al waſted; and then afterward the fleſh is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe extenuated. But now as for the harder parts (ſuch as are the Membranes, Cartilages, and eſpecially the Bones) although theſe may alſo in the like manner be dried; yet notwithſtanding they cannot poſſibly be ſo extenuated and dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that thence the whol body ſhould decreaſe. And hence it is likewiſe that the ſaid extenuation and Atrophy of the body doth appear eſpecially in thoſe parts in which there is much fatneſs, and where there are more or greater Muſcles, as in the Eyes and Temples.</p>

And therefore enquiry muſt be made whether external Cauſes, to wit, taſting, cares, grief, over hard labor, and the like, went before. If we find no ſuch thing, we are then to make enquity into the internal Cauſes; to wit, whether there be preſent a Hectick or any putrid Feaver, or whether there had not been one a little while before; and likewiſe a diſcovery muſt be made touching the Stomach, Spleen, and Liver; in what ſtate and condition they are: for by the Diſeaſes of the Bowels it may eaſily be known what the Cauſe of the Atrophy is.</p>

                     <p>As for what concerneth the Cure of an Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; when the Body is over dried, and that the Atrophy dependeth upon the defect and failing of Nutrition, it ſheweth that then humectation or moiſtening of the body is firſt of al to be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

But firſt of al, all the Cauſes, whether they be evident and external, or internal, they are to be removed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if faſting and hunger went before, let fitting food be again adminiſtred; if over much labor, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous cares and troubles of the mind, and the like, theſe al of them are to be removed. For theſe Cauſes being taken away, and convenient food being exhibited, the body is eaſily reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>But in thoſe that are ſick, if by reaſon of the dejected appetite, and ſome diſeaſe, either the Aliment be conſumed, or the Faculty weakened; that diſeaſe being removed, and the ſick perſon taking food again, the reſtauration of the body followeth. But now for the curing of the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Lungs, and in what manner theſe and the like Diſeaſes are to be removed, we have abundantly taught you in our Practical Phyſick. From whence this likewiſe appeareth very plainly, that it is but in vain for us to uſe our utmoſt endeavor for the nouriſhing of the body, whiles the body is repleniſhed with vitious humors; <hi>For the more we nouriſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure bodies, the more we hurt them,</hi> as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> tels us in the ſecond Book of his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms, Aphor. 10. For even the good juyces and meats are likewiſe corrupted by the ſaid vitious humors, and ſo the Cacochymy is augmented. And therfore theſe bad and offenſive humors are firſt of al to be prepared and evacuated. And this is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether true in the Cure of al and every Atrophy, that our main care and regard muſt be in reference unto the cauſe upon which it dependeth; and that our firſt and chief pains muſt be beſtowed in the removal thereof: and afterwards we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think our ſelves how the extenuated body may again be fetcht up and reſtored by Aliment. There ought alſo to be great care taken, that this very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of the body be rightly accompliſhed. And therefore firſt of al there ought to be given Aliments that are ſoon and eaſily concocted; and next of al, ſuch as do a little nouriſh, although they be more difficultly and ſlowly concocted.

                        <hi>Galen</hi> (in his Book of the Office of a Phyſician, Chap. 3.

For whenas the private parts do wither away, and are extenuated by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the hinderance of the afflux of the Aliment, and the languiſhing heat of the part; the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought then to uſe his utmoſt endeavor, that ſo ſtrength and heat may again be reſtored unto the part, and that the afflux of blood unto the part may again be procured. Thoſe means that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore ſtrength and heat unto the part, are, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and moderate rubbing of the Member, Motion, and the ſuppling of it with warm water: the ſame means do likewiſe draw and allure the blood unto the part. Now this friction, and ſuppling with warm water ought ſo long (and no longer) to be continued until the part be made ſomwhat red, and be as it were a little ſwoln, but not ſo long, until it be again aſſwaged and fallen. The parts may likewiſe be fomented; or (if their condition wil bear it) even ſoaked and bathed in baths made of Sage, the tops of Juniper, Lovage, Lavender, Mallows, and Marſh-mallows; with which when the part is ſufficiently fomented, it may afterwards he anointed with Oyls or convenient Unguents.</p>

To wit, a Wound and an Ulcer differ in this,<note place="margin">An <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer what it is properly.</note> that in a Wound there is only a ſolution of Unity, but there is not any thing of the part neceſſarily loſt; but in an Ulcer there is ſomthing diminiſhed and loſt from the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and if nothing elſe, yet at leaſt the Scarf-skin. For ſeeing that an Ulcer is alwaies from a corroding Cauſe, it cannot poſſibly be but that ſomething muſt be taken away from the part. For although in an Ulcer there be ſomtimes ſome kind of ſuperfluous fleſh growing forth; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there is nevertheleſs the Skin, yea and the very natural fleſh it ſelf wanting: and that Ulcer is no ſimple and ſingle Diſeaſe, but a Compound one, &amp; ſuch as is conjoyned with mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude augmented. There may likewiſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an Ulcer be conjoyned divers other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, a Diſtemper, an Inflammation, an <hi>Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas,</hi> an Excreſcent Fleſh, and other Diſeaſes, which yet notwithſtanding belong not unto the Eſſence of an Ulcer, but may be taken away the Ulcer ſtil remaining; the eſſence whereof doth conſiſt only in the ſolution of Continuity, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome kind of diminution of the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                  <p>The Subject of an Ulcer is a part ſoft or fleſhy, <note place="margin">The Subject:</note> the word Fleſh being here taken in a large acceptation; <hi>viz.</hi> not only for the Muſculous fleſh, but for that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that comprehendeth the fleſh, of which the Inteſtines, the Bladder, and other of the Bowels conſiſt; and herein lieth the difference between it and the rottenneſs that is in the Bones.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>The neereſt Cauſe is any matter whatſoever it be that hath in it any corroding quality; which comprehendeth under it not only the ſharp hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that are bred in the body, but likewiſe all thoſe external Cauſes that have in them a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding power, ſuch as are corroding Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments and poyſons: for it is falſe (that which ſome aſſert) that the very ſame Ulcers ariſe only from internal Cauſes; ſince that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth us, that the very ſame Ulcers may be excited alſo from external Cauſes. And ſo (<hi>Galen</hi> himſelf being witneſs in his fourth Book of the Method of Phyſick, and Chap. 9.) it is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently known even by experience it ſelf, that by the Fire, ſcalding hot water, Oyl, and other the like fervent juyces, in burnings and ſcaldings, they are not Wounds that are excited, but Ulcers; like as alſo Medicaments, and Poyſons that cauſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction and burning, excite Ulcers. And ſo poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous and contagious vapors breed Ulcers; like as Scabbineſs by contagion and infection breedeth
<pb n="2545" facs="tcp:49110:78"/> Scabbineſs; to wit, whileſt the Contagion that is imparted and communicated unto the Skin, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodeth it. And in the very ſame manner the vapors that are drawn in (by breathing) from the Lungs of Phthiſical Perſons do exulcerate the Lungs, and by contagion do breed a <hi>Phthiſis</hi> or Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in the like manner, upon the very ſame ground, Venome and Venereal Poyſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rub'd and chaf'd into any body, or by any means communicated thereunto, infecteth and exulcerateth the ſame. Neither is it of any weight or moment, that <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi> endeavoreth to reduce ſuch like Ulcers as theſe rather unto Wounds then unto Ulcers. For by this means he confoundeth altogether the Difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Ulcers and Wounds; in regard that Ulcers &amp; Wounds do not differ only in this, that Ulcers are evermore with a loſs of ſome of the ſubſtance, whereas Wounds may be without any ſuch loſs; but likewiſe, in that Wounds ariſe from ſome Cauſe that either cutteth into the part, or prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; or breaketh, or bruiſeth it; but theſe, to wit, the Ulcers, proceed from a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding Cauſe, whether it be external, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> whether it be internal. And this is alſo manifeſt in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that putrefie (for who can deny that to be an Ulcer that is excited from the <hi>Juyce</hi> of <hi>Spurge?</hi>) from the which ſaid Medicaments that Contagion that is in <hi>Scabies,</hi> the French Pox, and the <hi>Phthiſis</hi> or Conſumption, differeth but very little. For although (as <hi>Rudius</hi> there Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth) we do not deny that ſuch like Poyſons have likewiſe in them a power of infecting the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which being corrupted may afterward alſo promote theſe Ulcers: yet notwithſtanding we ſay, that all power whatſoever of corroding is not to be denied unto this very Contagion it ſelf, although afterward (when the corruption of the humors happeneth in the body) the increaſe of the Ulcer be thereby much promoted and furthered.</p>

                     <head>The Differences.</head>
                     <p>The Differences of Ulcers, ſome of them are Eſſential, others of them only Accidental. The Eſſential are thoſe that are taken from the very form of the Ulcer, from the Subject, and from the efficient Cauſe thereof. Thoſe that are taken from the form of the Ulcer are drawn from its fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, its magnitude, and the like. For ſome Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are great, others but ſmal; ſome of them long, others ſhort; ſome of them broad, others but narrow: ſome ſtraight, others again oblique, wreathed in, and fiſtulous; ſome of them equal, in which the fleſh in all the parts of the place affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted is equally waſted; others unequal, in which there is a greater part of the fleſh conſumed in this place, and a leſs portion in another place of the ſame Ulcer. From the part affected ſome Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are ſaid to be External, others Internal; ſome ſleight and ſuperficial, others of them profound and deep; and they may be in this, or in that part. The Differences ariſing from the Cauſes ſhall he ſhewn in the next following Chapter, wherein our purpoſe is to treat of the Cauſes of Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>But now the Accidental Differences of Ulcers are thoſe that are taken from ſuch things as are without the Nature &amp; Conſtitution of the Ulcer; and they are ſuch as are taken from the ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ulcer, or elſe from their time; viz. that ſome of them are Recent and new; others of them old and inveterate.</p>
                     <p>And hither likewiſe there may not unfitly be referred thoſe Differences that are taken from Cauſes accidental, and ſuch as are not common unto all Ulcers; to wit, that ſome Ulcers are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together with a fluxion, but that others of them want the ſaid afflux; that ſome of them are pure, others of them ſordid and ſoul, corroding, eating up, and Creeping along. For theſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences depend upon the Cauſes. And hitherto likewiſe belong thoſe Differences that are taken from the Accidents and Symptoms of the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; to wit, that ſome of them are altogether void of pain, others of them accompanied with a pain, an itching, pricking, and burning; ſome of them eaſie to be cured, others difficult and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, by the Greeks called <hi>Dyſepulota;</hi> ſome of them benign and favorable, others ſuch as have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a moſt peſtilent and malignant quality. And hither likewiſe are to be referred thoſe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that they commonly call <hi>Chironia</hi> and <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</hi> And yet nevertheleſs beſides theſe Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that may be properly called ſuch, there may yet ſome others be given, that are improperly ſo called; and ſuch as may rather be termed the Complications of Ulcers with other Diſeaſes, then Differences; and ſuch like Differences are theſe, to wit, that ſome Ulcers are conjoyned with Pain, a Diſtemper, a Phlegmone, a Callous or Braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fleſh, a Gangrene, a <hi>Cancer,</hi> Worms, and the Rottenneſs or Corruption of the Bones.</p>
                     <p>And (the truth is) the Differences and Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Ulcers are drawn from the Springs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid. But it being a truth likewiſe that ſome of the ſorts of Ulcers are taken and drawn from divers and ſeveral Fountains (that ſo we may not treat of Ulcers without any Method) I conceive that our Diſcourſe touching theſe Ulcers will be moſt Methodical if we handle them in the order following; to wit, 1. If we firſt of all treat of a ſimple Ulcer, or an Ulcer conſidered in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. 2. Of an Ulcer with a Diſtemper. 3. Of an Ulcer with an afflux of humors. 4. Of a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and foul Ulcer. 5. Of an Ulcer with Tumors. 6. Of Fleſh growing forth luxuriant and proud. 7. Of an Ulcer that is wan or Leaden coloured, and withall Callous. 8. Of an Ulcer that is hollow, and fiſtulous (which we commonly call the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula.) 9. Of an Ulcer with Worms. 10. Of an Ulcer with a rottenneſs of the Bones. 11.

                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>We have already told you in the precedent Chapter, that the neereſt cauſe of an Ulcer is a matter that hath in it a corroding quality, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be bred in the Body, or whether it happen unto the body from without.</p>
                     <p>Of the firſt ſort are al Humors whatſoever that are ſharp, and endued with a corroding Faculty bred in the body. But now this humor is either bred without the part affected, or elſe it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the very part it ſelf that is affected. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the affected part there is generated a cholerick humor, a ſalt flegm, a Whey that is ſalt, nitrous and ſharp, and black Choler or Melancholy. For theſe if they be bred in the body, and flow unto any one part, they may corrode and exulcerate the ſaid part. But from what Cauſes ſuch like hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors may be generated in the body, we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewn you in the ſecond Book of our Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, touching the cauſes of Diſeaſes, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Now they flow unto the part affected, either by tranſmiſſion, or by attraction; both which from what cauſes they proceed, we have declared above, in the firſt Part, and Chap. 5. of an Inflammation. And more eſpecially in the Spring time, various Ulcers are wont to ariſe from ſome internal vice of the Humors, as likewiſe from unſeaſonable and immoderate exerciſes. <hi>For if</hi> (as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth in his third Book upon the Aphoriſms, Aphor. 20.) <hi>in the Spring the Body be impure, there happeneth indeed then ſome ſuch like thing in the Spring time, even as we ſee there is wont to be in the exerciſes of the Body. For although theſe exerciſes be never ſo ſafe and healthful in themſelvs; yet nevertheles if you bring forth a man that is full either of flegm or yellow choler, or black choler, or even alſo of blood it ſelf to exerciſe, you ſhal undoubtedly by this exerciſing of him procure unto him either the Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the Apoplexy; or if not theſe, yet moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly the rupture of ſome Veſſel in the Lungs, or a moſt acute and violent Feaver. But unto ſuch as have had exerciſe enjoyn'd them, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out of humors that lie low and deep, this their exerciſe drawing forth unto the skin a Gaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy, that is to ſay, abundance of bad and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive humors, and ſcattering it throughout the parts, doth for the moſt part excite and cauſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and the</hi> Scabies <hi>or Scabbineſs. For this is that which</hi> Hippocrates <hi>hinteth unto us, when he ſaith, That if we exerciſe an impure and impur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged body, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers wil from thence ariſe. And ſo indeed in the very like manner, in the Spring time, the heat of the ambient Air diſſolving the humors calleth them forth unto the skin, by an effect altogether like unto that of exerciſes. For the effects of the Spring do not only reſemble the effects of Exerciſes, but they are alſo moſt like unto the works and operations even of Nature her ſelf. For indeed the parts that the Spring time acteth (like as doth Nature her ſelf) are, as wel to cauſe that occult and ſecret perſpiration throughout the whol body (by the which all the ſuperfluities of the body are emptied forth) as throughly to purge the body alſo by diſeaſes, after a various and different manner.</hi> Thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi> But then theſe Humors get their acrimony in the part it ſelf, by reaſon of ſome diſtemper in the ſaid part. And after this manner, like as even the <hi>Pus</hi> or pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>lent matter it ſelf, by its conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and long abode in the part becometh more ſharp, and ſtil ſo much the ſharper and corroding, by how much the humor (out of which it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated) is more tart and ſharp; ſo likewiſe doth the blood, which is corrupted by the part affected, and ſo putrefieth.</p>
                     <p>But now the Cauſes that happen unto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from without, are Septick (or putrefying) and Cauſtick Medicaments. Neither do I here exclude the very actual fire it ſelf, from bearing a part in the number of the external cauſes; in regard that the Eſchar that is left remaining appertaineth rather unto ulcers than unto wounds. And hither likewiſe is to be referred that contagion, by means whereof the vapors exhaling from the Lungs of Phthiſical perſons, &amp; by others attracted &amp; drawn in with the breath, do likewiſe exulcerate their Lungs, and ſo cauſe in them a <hi>Phthiſis</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; and alſo the naſtineſs and infections of ſuch as are ſcabbed, Leprous, and affected with the foul Diſeaſe, being communicated unto the skin, do exulcerate it, and there generate a like diſeaſe. But that attraction which is cauſed in gauling &amp; interfairing, or in wearing of the skin by the wringing and ſtreightneſs of the ſhoo, is not rightly and fitly referred unto, and reckoned up amongſt the nigheſt and moſt immediate Cauſes. For by the ſaid attrition the humor only is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, that afterwards corrodeth the Skin, and exciteth therein little bladders or bliſters. But now what the ſpecial cauſes of ſpecial Ulcers are, we ſhal afterwards ſhew you in its proper place, where the peculiar cauſes of each particular Ulcer ſhal be explained.</p>

                     <p>of the Ulcer cannot be filled up, neither can there fleſh enough grow forth; from whence it is that an hollow Cicatrice is cauſed.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. If the Ulcer after ſuch time as it is filled up with fleſh, and that a Cicatrice ought to have been brought thereupon, wax crude and raw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, there is then great cauſe to fear, that the Ulcer wil turn into a Fiſtula.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Ulcers that are in the Feet, and in the Hands, are wont ſomtimes to haſten on Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Glandules in the Arm-pits, or in the Groins, and Tumors in bodies that are plethorical and cacochymical. For the matter flowing down unto the ulcer in the Hand, or in the Foot, thoſe very parts themſelves likewiſe being become more looſe and weak do firſt of al receive and drink it in.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. The ulcers of the Thighs are for the moſt part hard to be cured, and eſpecially if they be cheriſhed by any diſtemper and default in the Spleen: for then the thick and melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that flow unto the ulcer do hinder the Cute thereof.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Ulcers that have continued long, and are now become inveterate, are not to be cured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much danger, unleſs the body be firſt of all carefully purged, and a good courſe of Diet be obſerved; of which very thing <hi>Gulielmus Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius</hi> (in his third Century, and Obſerv. 39.) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us an inſtance in a certain man, who having had an inveterate ulcer cured in his left Thigh by an unskilful and immethodical Empirick, after ſome few months was ſurprized with a Pleuriſie in his left ſide, upon which he died: and that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſickneſs he ſpit forth juſt ſuch ſtuff and excrements as before were wont to flow forth of the ulcer.

                     <p>Since that the Eſſence of an ulcer conſiſteth in the ſolution of unity, and the diminution of the magnitude of the affected part; the ſolution of unity ſheweth that union muſt be endeavored, and that which is loſt and diminiſhed indicateth its own reſtauration: to wit, the ulcer (as an ulcer) is to be filled up with fleſh, and united, and then ſhut up with a Cicatrice. But then when the ulcer is conjoyned with its cauſe, that either excited the ulcer from the very beginning, or elſe if (in the Cure) it obtain the Nature of that cauſe without which the ulcer had not been, the ſaid cauſe is then firſt of al to be removed. But then it is requiſite likewiſe that the temper of the part affected, as alſo the blood that floweth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to be ſuch as it ought to be: but if there chance to be any thing amiſs in theſe, it is to be corrected; touching which we ſhal hereafter ſpeak further in the ſpecial differences of Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>If therefore that Humor that excited the ulcer be ſtil preſent, it is to be evacuated: for in every affect in which the cauſe is ſtil preſent, the Cure is evermore to be begun from the removal of the Cauſe. And moreover, becauſe that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there wil alwaies fal forth ſome of the blood without their proper veſſels, and becauſe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes together with it other vitious humors in the body flow thither; leſt therefore that which ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore in the beginning of an ulcer it wil be requiſite to uſe Concocters, which they commonly cal Digeſtives. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore the filth and impurities which are wont to be generated in an ulcer (in regard that they hinder the curing thereof) are to be wiped clean away. So ſoon as the ulcer is cleanſed, the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof is to be filled up with fleſh: and at the length the ulcer is to be ſhut up with a Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice.</p>
                     <p>There is yet nevertheleſs likewiſe regard to be had unto the parts affected.

                     <p>But now how an ulcer may be filled up with fleſh, <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us in his third Book of the Method of Phyſick, and Chap. 3. To wit, unto the generating of fleſh there are neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the efficient Cauſe, and the matter. The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient is Nature, which (as it doth in the whol body, ſo likewiſe) in each particular part doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and draw ſo much Aliment as is neceſſary, and there ſhe retaineth it, concocteth, applieth, and aſſimilateth it. The matter is a pure and ſincere blood, that is generated from meat and drink. But becauſe (in every concoction) there is generated a twofold excrement; (one more thin, that inſenſibly exhaleth, or elſe is diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="2550" facs="tcp:49110:80"/> by Sweat; the other more thick;) the ſame likewiſe happeneth in the generation of Fleſh in the Ulcer; and if they be left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the part, they wil moiſten it, and hinder the generation of Fleſh. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Excrements in the Ulcers are to be clean wiped away, and dried up. And this is that which is ſo frequently &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly alleadged out of <hi>Galen</hi> (in his third Book of the Method of Phyſick, and Chap. 4. and in his fourth Book of the Method of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and Chap. 5. and in other places, here and there) where he ſaith that every Ulcer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth exſiccation. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in the beginning of his Book of Ulcers) thus writeth: <hi>That which is dry</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neer unto that which is ſound; but that which is moiſt cometh very nigh unto that that is vitiated.</hi> And ſo the Cure of an Ulcer it is indeed the work of Nature, that reſtoreth the fleſh that is loſt from the Blood flowing unto the part, and bringeth a Cicatrice over the Ulcer being ſilled up with fleſh. The Phyſitian he only removeth thoſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are an obſtacle to Nature in her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, whileſt he cleanſeth away the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and drieth the Ulcer; and when he doth this, he is then ſaid to generate Fleſh, and to introduce a Cicatrice.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>At the beginning therefore, if the body be plethorical, or Cacochymical, then the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood is to be diminiſhed, or the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy evacuated, leſt that the humors flow yet longer unto the part affected. And withall let there likewiſe be a good and wholſome Courſe of Diet appointed unto the Patient, that ſo there may no more of theſe bad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors be generated in the Body. And for all thoſe things likewiſe that we call not natural there ought to be ſuch a courſe taken, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unbefitting or inconvenient may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, nor any hurt be offered unto the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</p>
                     <p>Moreover in regard that it cannot well be, but that there wil ſomwhat of the Blood that is poured forth of the Veins, and ſomthing of the humors likewiſe ſtick in the Pores of the parts; that ſo therefore this may be Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and converted into <hi>Pus,</hi> Digeſtives or ſuppurating Medicaments are to be made uſe of, which in ſofter Bodies ought to be more mild and gentle (ſuch as are thoſe that are provided of the Oyl of Roſes, and the Yelks of Eggs;) and in thoſe bodies that are not ſo ſoft, but harder to be wrought upon, they are made of Turpentine, the Oyl of Egs, the Oyl of Roſes, the Oyl of Maſtick, the Yelks of Eggs; in Bodies that are more dry they are made of Roſin Turpentine, or Roſin of the Fir Tree, the Powder of Frankincenſe, the powder of Linſeed, Wheat flour, Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, and Hens fat.</p>
                     <p>After this Cleanſers are to be made uſe of. Yet notwithſtanding it often ſo happeneth, that with one Medicament we ſatisfie two ends and Scopes, to wit, both concoct and Cleanſe. Whereupon it is, that then in this caſe ſuppurating Medicaments are to be mingled with Deterſives or Cleanſers; and ſo the Suppuratives are made more hot, and more dry then otherwiſe they are wont to be. Yet nevertheleſs, in this commixture, there is a regard to be had unto the times; ſince that in the beginning Suppuratives, in the end Deterſives ought to prevail. And indeed it is more ſafe (forthwith in the very beginning) to mingle Abſterſives with Suppuratives, then to uſe Suppuratives alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For Nature is never idle, but even in the beginning betaketh her ſelf unto the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating of Fleſh; and to this end ſhe ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the excrements, which are therefore to be wiped away: neither muſt we be eaſily perſwaded to make uſe only of Suppuratives; ſince that it may then happen that by the uſe of them the Ulcer may be rendred more moiſt and ſordid: which haply might be the Cauſe, why <hi>Galen</hi> in the Cure of Ulcers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no mention at al of Suppurating Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And therefore moſt commodiouſly unto theſe Suppuratives, or Digeſtives (as they are uſually called) there are preſently added, Frankincenſe, Roſin Turpentine, and Roſin of the Fir Tree, Oyl of Maſtick, the Juyce of Smallage, and the like.</p>
                     <p>But now ſuch like Medicaments as theſe may be made in a various and different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, according to the various Conſtitution of ſeveral Bodies. In a Body that is ſoft and moiſt let ſuch a one as this following be made.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Roſes one ounce, Turpentine two ounces, the Yelk of one Egg, and ſo mingle them, &amp;c.</hi> That following is yet more dry.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Maſtick, and of Turpentine, of each half an ounce; the Yelk of one Egg, and ſo mingle them, &amp;c.</hi> This following is yet ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Myrrh, Aloes, of each half an ounce; Frankincenſe one ounce, Maſtick half an ounce, Gum Elemi two drams, Turpentine one ounce, Colophony half an ounce; Make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore out of theſe the Phyſitian may make his choice of ſuch Medicaments as are moſt fit and convenient for every ſeveral and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conſtitution. For the body by how much the more moiſt it is, by ſo much doth it require Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments that are leſs drying and Abſterſive: and on the Contrary, the Body when it is more dry, it then requireth the ſtronger ſort of drying Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments.</p>
                     <p>And ſo likewiſe in the colder times and ſeaſons of the yeer, we are to uſe thoſe Medicaments that are ſomwhat Warmer; but in the hotter ſeaſons of the year, the Medicaments that we make uſe of may be leſs hot. For if we apply Medicaments that are weaker then is fitting, then there will be great ſtore of <hi>Sanies</hi> (the thinner ſort of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) gathered together in the Ulcer, and the Fleſh that is generated wil be ſoft and ſlaggy. But if they be overſtrong and overdrying, the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer wil then be rendred dry, and the Lips thereof will become very red, the fleſh will be conſumed and ſometimes the Excrements of the Ulcer will be bloody, and a certain kind of mordication or biting wil be perceived in the part. But if the part be rendered exulcerated and dry (as natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is wont to be) and that neither <hi>Sanies</hi> nor <hi>Pus</hi> ſlow forth of the Ulcer, and that there appear a good colour in the Fleſh, it is then a Sign of a fit and convenient Sarcotick Medicament.</p>
                     <p>And here likewiſe the very form of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf ought to be regarded. For they are wont to be applied either liquid or humid, or Dry. In bodies hard and dry, and when a harder fleſh is to be generated the Sarcotick Pouders that are to be ſprinkled upon the Vlcer are moſt fit. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Frankincenſe halfe an ounce, Dragons Blood, Colophony, of each two Drams, and make a Pouder.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Frankincenſe half an ounce, Aloes two drams, Dragons Blood, and Sarcocol, of each one dram; make a Pouder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the Bodies be ſofter, we uſe thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that are moſt. And yet nevertheleſs, touching the preparation of Liniments and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, it is to be obſerved that they be not too ſoft. For ſuch as theſe are melted by the heat of the part, and ſo eaſily flow about and ſpread all abroad. And therefore if the Ulcers be not very deep (for in ſuch thoſe Medicaments are required that can penetrate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ven unto it) but that they ſtick in the Superficies of the Body, we muſt then make uſe of thoſe Medicaments that are endued with a thicker Conſiſtence. Moreover, Unguents that are overmoiſt, by reaſon of their Oyly Nature do mollefie, and generate a fleſh that is too looſe, and unlike unto that lying under it, eſpecially in dry Bodies.</p>
                     <p>When the ulcer ſhal be filled up with fleſh, it is to be cloſed with a Cicatrice, a Skin, or in ſtead thereof a Cicatice is to be generated, and by the benefit thereof the Continuity that was diſſolved is again to be united. But as in the generating of fleſh it is Nature that doth the work, and the Blood that ſupplieth the matter; ſo likewiſe the very ſame happeneth in the generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Skin: the Phyſitian by the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only removeth the Impediments. But that which is commonly told us, that the matter out of which the Cicatrice is generated is fleſh, which by the aſſiſtance of the Medicaments is ſo to be altered, and by the uſe of Dryers and Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents is ſo to be condenſed, that it may become like unto the Skin (if it be underſtood of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Agent) is altogether falſe. For as the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coporetick (or fleſh-cauſing) faculty in the fleſh doth only generate fleſh, and reſtoreth that which is loſt; even ſo the Cutiſick faculty (as I may ſo cal it) or Skin-making power, in the Skin doth only generate Skin. Whence it is, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet by the uſe of any Epulotick Medicament, or only by the uſe of Sarcoticks, hath there been known any Cicatrice to be produced in the midſt of an ulcer; but it beginneth to ariſe alwaies from the Skin lying neer unto it, about the lips of the ulcer, and ſo by degrees is ſenſibly extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until that at length the fleſh become wholly covered over with the Cicatrice. And hence it is alſo that oftentimes the ulcers are brought unto a Cicatrice, without any uſe at al of Epuloticks. And yet we acknowledg that Nature by the uſe of the ſaid Epuloticks may be much furthered and holpen in her operation. For if this Action be left wholly unto Nature, the Cicatrice will be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated but very ſlowly; not (as <hi>Fallopius</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) becauſe that the fleſh out of which the Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice
<pb n="2552" facs="tcp:49110:81"/> is to be generated is ſo moiſt that it cannot be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Nature of the cutaneous or skinny part; but it is becauſe the Cutiſick faculty in the Skin that is neer unto it cannot (but very ſlowly) change and convert into Skin, (which to wit, is a dry ſubſtance) that blood that floweth in unto it, the ſaid blood being moiſt: which it wil more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perform, if it be aſſiſted by Epulotick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that have in them a drying power. But of what quality theſe Epulotick Medicaments are, and what kind of Faculties they have in them, <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us in his third Book of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 4. &amp; 5. and in his fourth Book of the Compoſition of Medicaments according to the kinds of them, Chap. 1. And we have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe already ſpoken touching this very thing, in the fifth Book of our Inſtitutions, Part 1. Sect. 1. Chap. 9. To wit, by how much the Skin is more dry than the fleſh; by ſo much likewiſe ought the Epulotick Medicaments to be dryer than the Sarcotick. But in thoſe that are Active the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments may be as wel hot as cold; or both of them, if there be occaſion.</p>
                     <p>But now theſe Epuloticks are likewiſe of three ſorts, to wit, Mild, Mean, and more ſtrong. The Milder kind are, Cadmia waſhed, the Rind of Frankincenſe, Aloes, the Roots of ſweet Cypereſs (which ſome term Engliſh Galangal) Lead burnt and waſhed. The Compounds theſe; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent of Litharge, of Minium (or Vermilion) of Ceruſs or white Lead, of Diapompholyx, and the Cerote of Vermilion. The mean and middle ſort of Medicaments are theſe; Flowers of red Roſes, Pomegranate Flowers, unripe Gals, the Rind of the Pomegranate Tree, Bole-Armenick, Terra Lemma or Sealed Earth of Lemnos, Myro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balans, Dragons blood, Vermilion, Lead. Of the Compounds; Unguent of Tutia, Unguent Diapompholyx, Emplaſtrum Diapalma, Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum Gryſeum, and the Emplaſter of Lapis Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminaris. The ſtrongeſt ſort are; Chalcitis, Sarcocol, Allum, Braſs burnt, the off-ſcouring of Braſs. Of the ſtronger Compounds are theſe; Unguent of Tutty, and the Cerote of Bole-Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick. But now in the choyce of them we are to conſider both the Conſtitution of the ulcer, and the Nature of the body. For it ſomtimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth that the ulcers which when they were ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and foul felt no mordacity or ſharp biting (as it were) from the Medicaments, do yet perceive and feel the ſame from them, after ſuch time as they are purged and made clean. Wherefore even then when the ulcer is at the pureſt, we muſt from the ſtronger ſort of Abſterſive Medicaments have recourſe unto thoſe that are more mild and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; like as again in ſordid ulcers we are to betake our ſelves unto ſuch as are more abſterſive; unleſs the ulcers were made ſordid by the ſaid mordica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For now and then this very thing lieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Phyſician, as a thing altogether neceſſary to be done, to wit, that he betake himſelf unto the moſt ſtrong and forcible Abſterſive; upon which the ulcer again appeareth corroded and ſordid, the fleſh that is diſſolved and (as it were) melted by the Medicament, defiling and fouling the ſame; for the colliquated or diſſolved fleſh degenerateth into a filthy and noyſom <hi>Sanies.</hi> And there it behoveth us carefully and diligently to conſider, whether or no the ulcer (the fleſh lying under it being eaten through and diſſolved) be not become ſordid and foul, becauſe that when it required a Medicament apt and fit to take away its filth and naſtineſs, there was yet nevertheleſs no ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament applied and laid on. But now, when the ulcer is rendered more ſordid and filthy by the acrimony of the Medicament, this is evidently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by the Cavity that is made in the ulcer, which wil be the greater; as likewiſe the orifice thereof wil be the more red and hot. And then again in the next place, we ought carefully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether the conſtitution of the body be ſoft and moiſt, or elſe dry: for unto the ſoft the more mild, but unto the dryer bodies the more ſtrong and prevalent Medicaments are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                     <p>But the Epuloticks are then to be made uſe of (as <hi>Galen</hi> inſtructeth us, in his thirteenth Book of the Method of Phyſick, and Chap. 5.) when the ulcer is not altogether filled up with fleſh, but that there is yet a little thereof wanting. For in regard that Nature is never idle, but that even likewiſe then when it beginneth to produce the Cicatrice, the fleſh likewiſe withal at the ſame time receiveth yet ſome further increment and growth; if then at the laſt Epuloticks ſhould be adminiſtred when the ulcer is already altogether filled up with fleſh, we might wel fear, leſt that before ever the Cicatrice ſhould be compleated and fully finiſhed, in the interim the fleſh ſhould receive yet a further growth and encreaſe, and ſo the Cicatrice ſhould thereby be raiſed the higher. For in regard that the Skin is a Nervous ſubſtance, it cannot therefore be ſo generated anew as the fleſh, but in place and ſtead thereof there is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing generated that is like unto the skin, and this we cal a Cicatrice.</p>
                     <p>This is likewiſe to be taken notice of, That Epulotick Medicaments ought to be endued (both actually and potentially) with a drying faculty; and that therefore (for the producing and cauſing the Cicatrice) Emplaſters are moſt fitly and commodiouſly adminiſtred and applied.</p>

                     <note place="margin">An ulcer with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</note>And firſt of al, there is indeed oftentimes a diſtemper conjoyned with an ulcer; which when it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Cure of the ulcer is then much hindered. For in regard that the Nature of the part is the Efficient cauſe of the Cure of the ulcer, and that the blood is the matter: if the part be intemperate, neither of theſe can be in that right temper that they ought to be, neither can the ulcer be filled up with fleſh, nor cloſed with a Cicatrice, unleſs the fleſh lying underneath it be in its natural temper; as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in his third Book of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 8.</p>
                  <p>But what the differences of the Diſtempers are, we have already acquainted you in the ſecond Book of out Inſtitutions, Part 1. Chap. 3. which here alſo have their place; and there may concur together with the ulcer a difſtemper that is hot, or cold, moiſt, or dry; a diſtemper hot and moiſt; hot and dry; or cold and moiſt, cold and dry: and indeed the diſtemper may be either with or without mater. But of the diſtemper with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſhal ſpeak in the following Chapters. Here therefore in this Chapter we ſhal treat only of a Diſtemper without matter.</p>

                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>Now ſuch a Diſtemper as this, either it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before the riſe and appearance of the ulcer; or elſe it was excited even in the very time of the ulceration. But for the Cauſes of theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, what they are, we have likewiſe told you in the place before alleadged. Which that we may apply unto ulcers, a hot diſtemper in ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers is excited by a hot Air, by too many Swath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and bindings, and by Medicaments that are over hot. And on the contrary, a cold diſtemper is cauſed by the cold Air, from the not ſufficiently fencing and guarding the ulcer with Swathbands and warm Rowlers againſt the coldneſs and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the external Air; as likewiſe it is excited by cold Medicaments. The moiſt diſtemper is produced by the moiſt Ambient Air (and hence it is that in ſome places the Air is greatly hurtful unto ulcers) and by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fflux of humors; tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which more in che Chapter following. A dry diſtemper is cauſed by a dry Air, by Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are over drying, and by the want or ſcarcity of Aliment. Of Compound Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers the Cauſes are likewiſe compound.</p>

                     <p>The ſigns of a hot Diſtemper are, that heating Cauſes went before; and alſo, that not only the Lips, but even the very fleſh it ſelf of the ulcer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth more red than uſual; and the ſick perſon himſelf perceiveth a great heat in the ulcer, which for the moſt part a pain followeth: Cold Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments being thereunto applied do exceedingly refreſh and delight, and withal do greatly benefit the Patient; and on the contrary hot Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are greatly hurtful; the excrements of the ulcer are ſharp and biting.</p>
                     <p>A cold diſtemper cooling Cauſes went before it; in it the Lips of the ulcer decline unto a whiteneſs, or unto a wan leaden color, and they are ſoft; and hot things are helpful and agreeable unto the ulcer, but cold Medicaments are on the contrary very hurtful. If the Diſtemper be moiſt then moiſtening Cauſes had their precedence, the fleſh is ſoft, and appeareth lank and flaggy, and ſomtimes it groweth forth overmuch; the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ulcer are many; ſuch things as are drying do benefit, and thoſe Medicaments that moiſten do greatly hurt.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, A dry diſtemper is known by this, That drying Cauſes went before, the Lips of the ulcer appear dry, and ſquallid, and hard; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the ulcer are but few, or none at al.

Yet nevertheleſs the Cure ought ſo to be ordained, that the ulcer (as far forth as may be) may not be neglected. If yet nevertheleſs we cannot be helpful unto both of them at once, and together, then in this caſe it behoveth us to be moſt intent about that that is moſt urgent.

And albeit the ulcer requireth drying Medicaments, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in regard that the very heat it ſelf by conſuming the humors doth render the ulcer more dry, we muſt therefore make uſe of the milder and gentler ſort of dryers: but yet notwithſtanding theſe ought withal to be ſuch as are likewiſe endued with an aſtringent power; that ſo the flux (which the heat is wont eaſily to excite) may be inhibited and reſtrained. Moreover, ſince that the heat is wont to produce pain, let the Medicaments therefore be ſuch as have in them a power withal of mitigating pain, or at leaſt ſuch as are altogether free from any ſuch faculty of exciting pain; and therefore let them be ſuch as want the drying and abſterſive power. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Medicaments are uſeful and proper that are made of the Juyce and Water of Roſes, of Plantane, Endive, Vinegar, Saunders, Bole-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick, Nightſhade, burnt Lead, Cadmia, Sugar of Saturn, Oyl of Roſes, Turpentine, Plantane Water often waſhed.

For by how much the moiſter the ulcer is, by ſo much the more forcibly and ſtrongly drying ought the Remedies (that are required) to be.

Now as for the manner how this warm Water is to be applied unto the part, it is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; and it is performed either by fomentation, or pouring it on, or by bathing therein. The Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is performed with a Spunge, a Cloth, Hurds, or Cotton: and this Fomentation is the moſt commodious and convenient way of moiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the part affected. As for pouring the warm Water thereon, or bathing in it, we conceive not that it is any way ſo fit and proper. And it wil be yet far better, if the part be fomented with Oyl and Water together blood-warm, rather then with Water alone, eſpecially in the Winter time. For although warm Water may heat the part with an actual warmth; yet nevertheleſs, after the fomentation is paſt, it cooleth the part, and withal ſcattereth the heat; which is prevented by mingling Oyl therewith, for by this means the Pores of the Skin are obſtructed. After the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, let ſome Cataplaſm that hath in it a Moiſtening faculty be laid on. As for example.</p>

                     <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of an Ulcer with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of humors.</head>
                  <p>BUt very rate it is, that a Diſtemper happeneth alone unto an Ulcer; but for the moſt part, the Diſtemper is accompanied with matter, and the afflux of humors.</p>
                  <p>But now how many Cauſes there are of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of humors, we have already told you, in the firſt Part, Chap. 1. touching Tumors in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. To wit, unto the exulcerated part there ſlow humors, either from the whole body, or elſe from ſome one particular part generating vitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; whileſt Nature inſtigated and ſtird on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the abundant ſtore, or by the quality of the humor, expelleth and driveth them forth, and heapeth them up in the exulcerated part; or elſe when the part (by reaſon of pain, or heat) attracteth the humors; or when the humors do of their own accord flow down unto the part that is ſituated in a lower place; or elſe when they are any otherwiſe moved unto a weak and ignoble part: all which in what manner and by what means they may happen, we have acquainted you in the place before alleadged.</p>
                  <p>There is great variety of Excrements that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the afflux of the Humors unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerated part. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of the times of the whol Diſeaſe, divideth theſe Excrements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sanies</hi> and <hi>Pus. Celſus</hi> likewiſe in his fifth Book, and Chap. 26. beſides the blood that is known unto al, determineth tha likewiſe <hi>Sanies</hi> and <hi>Pus</hi> do iſſue forth from wounds and ulcers; and there he thus writeth: That <hi>Sanies is thinner than Blood, and yet variouſly thick alſo, and glutinous, and colored.</hi> Pus <hi>is moſt thick, and moſt white, more glutinous than Blood and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. There iſſueth forth blood</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from a wound that is recent and new made, or elſe that hath been of ſome continuance, and is now upon its healing. The</hi> Sanies <hi>is betwixt both theſe times.</hi> Pus <hi>out of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer that is now upon the very point of healing. Again, both</hi> Sanies <hi>and</hi> Pus <hi>have certain ſpecies or kinds diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Greek names. For there is a certain kind of</hi> Sanies, <hi>which is termed either</hi> Ichor, <hi>or</hi> Meliceria. <hi>And there is a</hi> Pus <hi>that is called</hi> Elaiodes. Ichor <hi>is thin, ſomthing white, and it iſſueth forth of a bad and naughty <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, and eſpecially when a Nerve being hurt, and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation followeth thereupon.</hi> Meliceria <hi>is thicker and more glutinous, ſomwhat whitiſh, and not much unlike unto white Honey: This likewiſe iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth out of evil <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, when the Nerves neer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Joynts are hurt; and of al theſe places it eſpecially floweth forth of the Knees.</hi> Elaiodes <hi>(which is thin, ſomwhat white, as it were anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a kind of fatneſs, and not much unlike unto white Oyl) appeareth in great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, that are upon the point of healing.</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding others there are that do otherwiſe uſe theſe names. Yet nevertheleſs, if we wil ſpeak properly, <hi>Pus,</hi> with the Greeks <hi>Puon,</hi> is that excrement of the ulcer that hath its original from Blood, or from the fleſh bruiſed and diſſolved, and it appeareth in ulcers that are void of al other excrements, or ſuch as have been juſt now clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from other excrements. Al the reſt of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements that proceed from other humors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may be comprehended under the name of <hi>Ichor</hi> or <hi>Sanies;</hi> yet nevertheleſs the moſt do diſtinguiſh between <hi>Sanies</hi> and <hi>Sordes,</hi> and they cal the thin and watery excrements by the name of <hi>Sanies</hi> (which ſome do cal <hi>Virus</hi> or Venom) but the thicker excrements they cal <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des;</hi> ſo that from the thin excrement the ulcer is rendered moiſt, and from the thick it is made ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and foul.</p>

                     <p>Ulcers with the afflux of humors are known, Firſt, by the Tumor or Swelling that appeareth not only in the lips, but likewiſe in the neet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning parts. And then (next of all) from the pain, which is very grievous and troubleſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſick Perſon, eſpecially if the Nervous parts be affected. Thirdly, from the great ſtore of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, which is far greater than what it was wont to be, proportionably according to the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude or bigneſs of the Ulcer. And laſtly, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it there be likewiſe adminiſtred all things that are neceſſarily required unto the Cure thereof, yet we find the Cure of them very difficult; in regard that the flowing humors hinder the Cure.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. All Ulcers (as we ſaid but now) with an afflux of the humors are very hard to cure; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that from the afflux of the humors the Ulcer is rendered moiſt, gains growth and increaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſwelleth up, and the pain is likewiſe hereby xcited.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But by how much the aſſlux of the humor is greater, and by how much alſo the humor that floweth thereto is the worſe, by ſo much the more difficult will it be to Cure the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</p>

                  <div type="cure">
                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>Firſt of all therefore, in regard that the Ulcer cannot be cured unleſs the Flux be removed, therefore the Flux it ſelf, with all its Cauſes, is to be taken away; and thereupon, whether in the whole body, or elſe by the default and ſomething far amiſs in the Liver, or the Spleen, the vitious humor be generated, the generating of it is to be hindered and prevented, and ſo much thereof as is already flown in is in a convenient manner to be
<pb n="2557" facs="tcp:49110:85"/> prepared and evacuated; touching which very thing we have already elſwhere ſpoken at large. Moreover, leſt that the humor ſhould flow unto the affected part, it is to be drawn back, intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and driven back. Among the Revulſive Aids and Remedies, in the firſt place we eſteem and account of Iſſues that are made in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part; becauſe that the Humor that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the part affected, they evacuate and empty it forth by ſome other place. And theſe Iſſues are indeed oftentimes very neceſſary in old inveterate Ulcers. For when Nature hath been now of a long time accuſtomed to evacuate the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humors by the exulcerated part, if the ulcer be altogether cloſed, and that there be any of the vitious humors heaped up there, it may eaſily then come to paſs that theſe humors regurgitate and flow back again into the Veins, and ſo ruſh into ſome more noble part; but al this may be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Fonticle or Iſſue.</p>
                     <p>But the aforeſaid Defenſives do intercept; which are to be impoſed above the exulcerated part, in the ſound part, toward the root of the Veſſels, in thoſe places where the Veins being big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger do appear more conſpicuouſly; which ſaid Veſſells (through which the humor floweth) they ſtrengthen and ſhut up, and withal drive back the humor. And they are formed out of thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that are dry and aſtringent; ſuch as are, Bole-armenick, Dragons blood, Flowers of Red Roſes, Pomegranate flowers, the Rinds of Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, Myrtle, Allum with the white of an Egg, Oyl of Myrtle, Oyl of Roſes, autere or ſharp Wine, aſtringent Waters: Out of which Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms or other Medicaments are prepared.</p>
                     <p>But then unto the part affected it ſelf Repellers are to be applied, that ſo the Humors that do as yet fluctuate in the Veſſels of the affected part may be repelled. And therefore the exulcerated part, or the parts neer unto it, are to be waſhed with Allum Water, the Water or Decoction of Plantane, of Roſes, of Pomegranate flowers, the Roots of ſweet Cyperus, Cinquefoyl, and the like: but the neer adjacent parts are to be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the unguent of Bole. And in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Ulcer there is a drying Pouder to be laid on, of Litharge, Tutty, Lead, Corals, Bole-armenick, Chalcitis, the white un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent of <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> and unguent Diapompholyx. In a word, the Sarcoticks ought here to be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than in the ſimple ulcer that is not peſtered with this flux, that ſo they may throughly dry up the humor that ſticketh in the pores of the parts; and yet nevertheleſs they muſt be ſuch as are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mordacity at al, that ſo there may be no pain excited. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Turpentine one ounce, the Suet of a Bull half an ounce, burnt Lead an ounce, Tutty prepared half an ounce: Mingle them, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet nevertheleſs, if the matter be crude and biting, ſome Frankincenſe is to be added, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Concoction of the humor.</p>
                     <p>Touching the form of the Medicaments this is to be obſerved, that they be not of a moiſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, not Oyly and fat, in regard that they do more looſen and moiſten the part, as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in his firſt Book of the Compoſition of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Chap. 6. and in his fourth Book of the Compoſition of Medicaments, Chap. 1. &amp; 13. And yet nevertheleſs, we are not alwaies to perſiſt in one and the ſame kind of Medicaments. For it oftentimes ſo happeneth that what did once or twice do good, may afterwards (the humor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any waies dried up) prove prejudicial and hurtful, by exciting a mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dication or biting; and there the Medicament is then to be changed, and one more gentle to be adminiſtred in the place thereof.</p>
                     <p>After that the ulcer is filled up with fleſh, the Cicatrice is at length to be brought over it by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloticks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Guido</hi> in his Tract. 4. Doct. 1. Chap. 2. upon ſuch ulcers as theſe, adviſeth us to lay on a thin Leaden Plate with a hole bored through it. For Lead being thus beaten into a thin Plate cooleth, and therefore is of ſpecial uſe in ſuch like ulcers, if a fitting Ligature be added; in regard that it preſſeth forth the humor out of the part affected, and hindereth the influx thereof into the part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerated.</p>

                  <p>THe moiſt ulcers that are accompanied with an afflux of Humors are for the moſt part thereby made ſordid and ſoul (ſuch as the Greeks cal <hi>Rupara</hi>) to wit, if that thick and ſnotty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement (which in ſpecial they cal <hi>Sordes</hi>) flow forth; and putrid, if the ſaid excrement breath forth a grievous and noyſom ſmel, like unto that of a dead Carkaſs. For ſordid and putrid ulcers (as <hi>Guido</hi> in his Tract. 4. Doct. 1. Chap. 3. tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us) differ only in degrees, viz. in this, That the one is ſuch in a greater, the other in a leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. For if the excrements of the ulcer be ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thick and ſordid, then we cal it a ſordid ulcer; but if they likewiſe receive a putridneſs, inſomuch that they putrefie and corrupt the fleſh that lieth under it, and alſo the ſofter parts, ſo that there breath forth from thence a noyſom and unſavory vapor, then it is called a putrid ulcer.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>The nigheſt Cauſes of this ulcer are depraved humors, malignant, and ſuch as receive an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and moiſt heat and putridneſs. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe humors either they flow unto the part affected from ſome other place, or elſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch in the very part it ſelf, by reaſon of ſome diſtemper or debility in the ſaid part, or by
<pb n="2558" facs="tcp:49110:86"/> reaſon of the unſeaſonable uſe of moiſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous, and Emplaſtick Medicaments; or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the adminiſtring thereto thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were too weak in drying, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe Dryers that were required. And on the contrary, likewiſe, the ſame ulcers are made ſordid, by reaſon of overſtrong Abſterſives, that even melt and diſſolve the ſound fleſh.</p>
                     <p>And ſomtimes the humor acquireth ſo great an acrimony, that it corrodeth not only the exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted part, but likewiſe the ſound part lying neer unto it, and from day to day creepeth wider and broader; and theſe ulcers are termed Corroſive, Creeping, and Devouring Ulcers.</p>

                     <head>Signs Diagnoſtick.</head>
                     <p>Sordid ulcers are eaſily known by the ſight; when there appear in them in great abundance certain Impurities that are viſcid and clammy; when the fleſh is become flaggy and ſoft, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes groweth forth too far. If alſo there be added a putridneſs, and if there be perceived a grievous ſtinking ſmel, and ſuch as is like unto that of a dead Carkaſs. If the ulcer be corroſive and creeping, if an itching and pain be felt; and if the ulcer doth continually grow greater.</p>
                     <p>As for what belongeth unto the ſigns of the Cauſes; if the humors flow either from the whol body, or from any one part thereof, this wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by thoſe ſigns that we have already propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the precedent Chapter. If the part be weak, and diſtempered, this may likewiſe be known by ſigns of its own; and there wil then be no appearance at al of any freſh and lively color in the part. It the Ulcer hath been made ſordid and foul by the weakneſs of any Medicament, then the ulcer appeareth whitiſh, and that whiteneſs encompaſſeth about the whol ulcer, like unto a kind of Web. On the contrary, if the ulcer hath been made ſordid by a too ſtrong abſterſive Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament, then the ulcer is made hollow, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from day to day it becometh more red; and there floweth forth a ſubtile <hi>Pus</hi> that is not much in quantity, but very hot.</p>

                     <p>In ſordid and putrid ulcers there is firſt of al great care to be had in the courſe of Diet; and the body is to be purged from al bad and vitious humors. But upon them there is to be put Abſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and cleanſing Medicaments; ſuch as are Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, Salt Water, and thoſe things that are made of the juyce of Smallage, of Wormwood, Barley meal, of the bitter Vetch Orobus, Myrrh, and Honey of Roſes. But more eſpecially the Spirit of Wine doth exceedingly benefit in the purging and cleanſing of al putrid ulcers; which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be mingled together with the other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Lignum Guajacum, and the Rinds of the ſame, of each one ounce; the Root of long Ariſtolochy, the leſſer Centaury, Wormwood, and Agrimony, of each one handful; the Rind of the Frankincenſe tree, Myrrh, of each half an ounce: boyl them al in a ſufficient quantity of Wine; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtraining add of Honey ſcummed four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Spirit of Wine one ounce: mingle them, &amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>If the ulcer be become ſordid by the alone uſe of Unctuous and Oyly Medicaments, and if that there be no other more grievous cauſe of the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and naſtineſs thereof, then the milder and gentler ſort of Abſterſive Medicaments may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: for the drier ſort of Medicaments being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, the ulcer is eaſily cleanſed.</p>
                     <p>But if the ulcer be become ſordid and ſoul from the uſe of Medicaments that were overſtrong, then the milder are to be impoſed; ſuch as are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent Diapompholyx; the ſtronger ſort of them are, unguent Apoſtolorum, and the Aegyptiack unguent.

                     <p>Take <hi>Agrimony, Centaury the leſs, of each half a handful; boyl them in Wine: unto the ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning add the juyce of Smallage two ounces; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of Roſes one ounce; the meal of Barley, and of the bitter Vetch Orobus, of each one dram and half; Turpentine waſhed in the Spirit of Wine, two ounces; mingle them: and make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the ulcer be putrid, it is to be waſhed with Oxycrate, Ley, Brine; and upon them there are

                     <p>But the hollow Ulcer that is ſordid and putrid, is to be anoynted with the Unguent of Bolearme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, or ſome other Cooler, leſt that there be an afflux of humors excited from the uſe and biting quality of hot Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>If the putridneſs be greater, ſo that there be cauſe to fear leſt that the part it ſelf may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, then we are to make uſe of the ſtronger ſort of them, which ſhall be hereafter declared and ſet down in the Chapter of the Gangrene and a <hi>Sphacelus.</hi>

                     <p>The way, Means, and Method of Curing it was there likewiſe declared; which is yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs here in ſuch manner to be inſtituted, that the Ulcer may not in the leaſt be neglected. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either the Blood offend in its quantity and overgreat abundance, or elſe if vitious humors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the body, theſe are firſt of all to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated. In the next place regard is to be had to the very part affected. After this, Medicaments are to be applied unto the place affected, which may either diſcuſs the humor that is the Cauſe of the Tumor, or elſe convert it into <hi>Pus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore in an Inflammations there ought to be applied a Cataplaſm made of Quinces boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Pouder of Myrtle, or of boyled Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, with the Meal or flour of Barly, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rinds, and red Roſes. In the augmentation of the Ulcer there muſt be added Camomile flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Bean meal. In the State, Mallows, Marſhmallows, the meal of Linſeed, and of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugreek. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Barley meal two ounces, the pouder of Camomile flowers one ounce, the meal of Linſeed and of Fenugreek, of each ſix drams; and make a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Tumor tend toward a Suppuration, the Suppuration is then to be holpen on with a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm of Mallows, Maſhmallows, Linſeed, Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, and Wheat, and other ſuch like Ripeners. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Mallows, Marſhmallows, of each one handful; boyl them in Water until they be ſoft, and then bruiſe them well; When they are bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then add of the flour of Linſeed, and Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, of each one ounce; Wheat flour half an ounce, Swines fat and Oyl of Roſes, of each one ounce, and Mingle them.</hi>

Which if it ſhould change ſo to happen, it wil then be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry requiſite to make uſe of Coolers, Driers, and Aſtringents together. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Platane Leaves one handful, flowers of red Roſes half a handful, boyl them to a ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then let them be bruiſed; when they are bruiſed and paſſed through a Hair-ſieve, add of

                     </p>
                     <p>That that is here eſpecially uſeful and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the Unguent <hi>Diapompholyx;</hi> unto which (if you pleaſe) you may yet further add ſome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Saturn.</p>
                     <p>If the Tumor be cold, then ſuch a like Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm as this may be impoſed.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Leaves of Mallows, Marſhmallows, of each one handful; and boyl them in Ley unto a ſoftneſs, and then bruiſe them wel; then add the pouder of Marſhmallow root one ounce and half, Camomile flowers ten drams, Oyl of white Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as much as wil ſuffice, and ſo make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Cancer</hi> be joyned with the Ulcer, there can then be no other Cure more fit and proper then that we have already propounded, touching an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated <hi>Cancer.</hi>

                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>Now this happeneth either from the abundance of blood that floweth unto the part affected; or elſe by reaſon that the Sarcotick Medicaments that had been adminiſtred were overweak, and leſs drying then what was fit. If the former of theſe be the Cauſe, then the fleſh it ſelf wil be in a right temper, only there wil be too much thereof. If overmuch fleſh proceed from the latter of the two Cauſes, then the fleſh wil not be ſound and ſolid, but looſe and Spungy.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="cure">
                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>As for what concerneth the Cure, if the firſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, faſting and ſpareneſs of Diet is then to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned unto the ſick Perſon, and dry Medicaments are to be impoſed. But if the fleſh begin to grow proud by reaſon of the uſe of Sarcotick and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Medicaments that were in their own Nature overweak, then we ought to make uſe of the ſtronger ſort of Deterſives, and ſuch as produce a Cicatrice; and if there be occaſion, even ſeptick Medicaments likewiſe. And ſuch are, a Spunge burnt, dry Liniments impoſed, the rind of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, Galls, Aloes, Tutty, and burnt Alum.</p>
                     <p>And indeed in the Toes, when by reaſon of the compreſſion of the excreſcent Nails the fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to be luxuriant, ſo that a man can neither put on his Shoes, not go without pain, then burnt Alum alone ſprinkled thereon wil take away the ſaid fleſh. The ſtronger Medicaments, are, the ruſt and ſcouring of Braſs, Chalcitis, Mercury precipitate, Mercury ſublimate. And therefore whenſoever there is need but of litttle drying, then let there be impoſed dry Liniments, or elſe ſuch as have been ſoaked and wel wet in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Decoction.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Galls, the rinds of Frankincenſe, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, of each one dram; Flowers of red Roſes, Pomegranate flowers, and Rue, of each half a handful, Alum two drams; boyl them al in Wine.</hi> Or,</p>

                     <p>The Green Water.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Alum Crude, and Green, of each two drams, boyl them in eighteen ounces of Wine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a fourth part be waſted; then ſtrain it; and then take Camphyre one dram: diſſolve it in one ounce of the Spirit of Wine, and add it unto the former.</hi>

                  <p>IT ſometimes ſo happeneth that the lips of the Ulcer are made hard, wan, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Now this is cauſed by thoſe things that dry overmuch, or by the cooling of the externall Air, or by the afflux of hot humors.</p>
                  <p>But from what cauſe ſoever it happen, the Ulcer cannot be cured, neither can it be cloſed up with a Cicatrice, unleſs that hardneſs be firſt taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the exulcerated part be reduced unto its natural ſtate. And therefore if the hardneſs be leſs, then Emollients and Diſcuſſives are to be made uſe of, ſuch as are of the Mucilage of Linſeed,

                  <p>Take <hi>the Mucilage of the ſeed of Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, of Fenugreek, of each two drams; Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine one ounce; Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and of white Lilies, of each three drams; Wax as much as wil ſuffice, and make a ſoft <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</hi>

                  <p>The ſimple Diachylon Emplaſter is likewiſe here very good, and of ſingular uſe.</p>
                  <p>But now if the hardneſs be greater, and that it yield not, neither give way unto Emollient and Diſcuſſive Medicaments, after what manner ſuch a like ulcer ought then to be cured, <hi>Galen</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us, when in the fourth Book of his Method of Phyſick, and Chap. 2. he thus writeth: <hi>When the lips of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are only ſomwhat diſcolored, or made a little harder than ordinary, they are then to be cut out even unto the ſound fleſh. But whenas this Affect hath made a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progreſs, then it falleth under deliberation, whether al that which is ſeen to appear preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be to be cut forth, or elſe rather in time, and as ſoon as may be to be cured. And it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, that in this caſe the wil and mind of the Patient is to be conſulted and followed. For ſome of them had rather be cured without being cut, though it be a long time firſt: Others again there be that wil be content to undergo any pain or hardſhip, ſo that they may be ſoon and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured.</hi> For ſuch like ulcers are moſt ſpeedily (yea and moſt commodiouſly likewiſe, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) cured, if the hard and wan fleſh be cut forth (even unto the ſound) with a fit and convenient Inſtrument. For both the pain is ſhorter, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any bad and hurrful quality introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the part, as there is by corroding Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments. For the hardneſs thereof is likewiſe very fitly waſted and removed by an actual Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
                  <p>But if the ſick perſon wil endure neither inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor burning, the hard fleſh is then to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted away, and conſumed by ſuch like corroding Medicaments as we have elſwhere propounded. The green Water that we deſcribed in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter is likewiſe of ſingular benefit; and ſo is the Pouder alſo there mentioned. The Oyl of Vitriol is one of the ſtronger Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>Yet nevertheleſs, we muſt be very cautious how we uſe the ſtronger ſort of Medicaments in the Nervous parts: and Defenſive Medicaments are to be applied unto the neer parts, leſt that there be a pain excited, and a new afflux of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors cauſed.</p>
                  <p>If the lips of the ulcer be leaden colored, wan, and black, they are then to be ſacrified, and the vitious blood is to be drawn forth: afterward a dry Spunge is to be laid theron; and at length drying Medicaments, as the green Water, or the Pouder deſcribed in the precedent Chapter, or the like Medicament.</p>

Chap. 6.) it wil be altogether needleſs here to add any thing more unto what hath been there delivered. Only we ſhal yet here acquaint you with ſome few things by way of Advertiſement. The firſt is this, That hollow and furrowed Ulcers may not only be ſo bred, but the ſinuous and nooky ulcers may oftentimes likewiſe ſucceed wounds; which eſpecially happeneth by the negligence of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, and this very frequently chanceth in the Thighs. For if ſuch like places where the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are larger the wound be not ſo ordered that the</hi> Pus <hi>may be expelled forth by the orifice of the wound, it then by its weight deſcendeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the guidance of the Muſcles, and there raiſeth furrows and Conney-burrows (as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Phyſitians term them) and more eſpecially if it hath been long detained, and be thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſharp and corroding. And in ſuch a like ulcer, ſince that al the</hi> Pus <hi>can hardly be expelled forth by the Ligature that is toward the upper Orifice, it wil therefore be neceſſary to open a</hi> Sinus <hi>or nook in the lower part; which being done, and a way and paſſage made for the iſſuing forth of the</hi> Pus, <hi>ſuch wounds are afterward eaſily cured.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And therfore in the ſecond place it is to be noted, That we are to uſe ſuch an expreſſive Ligature (leſt that, whether in Wounds or in Ulcers Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's be generated) to wit, which beginneth from the very bottom of the wound or ulcer, and endeth in the orifice thereof; this notwithſtanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies provided, That by how much the nearer it approacheth unto the Orifice, by ſo much the looſer ought it to be.</hi>

                     <hi>Thirdly, You are to be hereof admoniſhed, That in regard ſuch like ſinuous ulcers become ſordid and foul, for the moſt part, that therefore the Spirit of Wine is very fitly mingled together with other Medicaments, becauſe it hath in it an excellent property and vertue to cleanſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie ſuch like ulcers as theſe.</hi> Franciſcus Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riola <hi>hath a ſingular and happy way of Curing this dangerous nooked or furrowed ulcer, in the fifth Book of his Obſervations, Obſerv. 1. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the ſame place, Obſerv. 7. where they may both be ſeen.

But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the Cavity could not be filled up, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt cleanſing the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, therefore the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer was firſt of al to be cleanſed and purified: for an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer can neither be filled up, nor agglutinated, unleſs it be pure and clean, as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us. And therefore to cleanſe away the thin Ichorous excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and impurities (with which the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer was extreamly peſtered) we proceeded in the uſe of many ſeveral Remedies, ſtil proceeding from the weaker unto the ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>Take the Decoction of whol Barley one quart; Honey of Roſes ſix ounces; mingle them, and make an injection thereof into the inſide of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer with a ſtraight Syringe or injection pipe; this without any mordacity at al cleanſeth and waſheth away the filth and pollutions of thoſe thin ichorous excrements of any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer. But when we had diſcovered that there was preſent much both thick and ſordid Sanies, we then found that there was great need of a ſtronger cleanſing. And thereupon we made uſe of this other ſtronger and more prevalent Remedy, to wit, mingling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the aforeſaid <hi>Aegyptiack Unguent,</hi> and withal mingling a ſmal proportion of <hi>Aqua vitae, viz.</hi> Two ounces. Somtimes, and after ſome certain daies when we had made uſe of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Decoction, and yet had not ſufficiently gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our deſire as touching the deterſion and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, we then thought good to make uſe of this notable and effectual Injection.</p>

                     <hi>Take</hi> Lignum Sanctum poudered very ſmal, and the bark of the ſame Wood, of each two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; long Ariſtolochy, Centaury the leſs, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Agrimony, Horſtail, Olive Leaves, Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Leaves, Pimpernel, and the greater conſound, of each one handful; the rinds of Frankincenſe, Myrrh, and Sarcocol, of each half an ounce; ſweet ſcented red Wine tree pints; Honey ſcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med four ounces; let there be a decoction of them al; of the ſtraining make an injection within the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, at the very time of injection add thereto one ounce of the beſt <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> for every doſe, or as oft as you adminiſter the Decoction. Where by the way this is worthy your taking notice of, and we then found it by obſervation, that the <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> (together with the aforeſaid Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is moſt powerful, and moſt efficacious in clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſordid <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers that are without biting, and in throughly drying of them, and in promoting the agglutination and ſodering thereof. But if together with the aforeſaid Decoction you add of the beſt <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> one quart, and ſo deſtil them in a Glaſs Alembick, in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> there is from thence a moſt admirable Liquor to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and drawn forth, both for the cleanſing of al ſordid and hollow <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, as alſo for the agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinating and cloſing of them up: which we at that time frequently found by experience. For truly great and admirable is the power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> in the cleanſing and glewing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again (as it were) of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe of the Nervous parts (as we then diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by dayly experience and obſervation) ſo that we know nothing that is better for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But when the time was come that we thought fit to reſtore in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer the fleſh that was loſt, we then made uſe of this other injection; the virtue and faculty whereof is, both moderately to cleanſe, and to fill up the Cavity with fleſh; whereupon it may deſervedly be ſtiled a Sarcotick Remedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take</hi> Plantane Leaves two handfuls; Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Herb Robert, Cinquefoyl Leaves, of each one handful; the tops of Wormwood, in number three; of both the Conſounds, Horſtail, Ceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach (or Spleenwort) St. Johns wort, of each half a handful; Betony one handful; make a Decoction in water: in the end of the Decoction add, of red aſtringent Wine one quart, the Leaves of red Roſes, and Myrtle Leaves, whol Barley, of each two pugils or ſmal handfuls; take of the ſtraining two quarts: unto which add, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal one ounce, of the bitter Vetch Orobus half an ounce, Frankincenſe, Maſtich, Sarcocol, Roſin of the Pine-tree, of each one ounce; Myrrh, round Ariſtolochy, of each ſix drams; Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Flowerdeluce half an ounce, Honey of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes four ounces: mingle them, and of this Liquor make an injection within the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer; for it fitly cleanſeth and generateth fleſh, as we may perceive by the Nature of the Ingredients; and ſo the event taught us. After the injection within the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, we then very commodiouſly made uſe of this following <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent, with tents, Spleen-like long Plaiſters, &amp;c.</p>

Turpentine waſhed in white Wine three ounces, Honey ſcummed four ounces; Wax as much as wil ſuffice: make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent; with the which after that we had cauſed Liniments to be filled; we then ordered and appointed them to be impoſed upon the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>

                  <p>After the cleanſing of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer was perfectly finiſhed, we then with very good ſucceſs made uſe of this Sarcotick Pouder likeſwiſe within the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take</hi> Elect and choyce Aloes two drams; Frankincenſe, the Rinds of the ſame, Myrrh, and Sarcocol, of each one dram; Roots of the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine Flowerdeluce four ſcruples: make of al theſe a moſt ſmal and ſine Pouder, and apply it unto the hollow <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, to fill up the Cavity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>But we likewiſe (after thoſe aforeſaid Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) thought good to make uſe of a drying Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, fitted for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, and ſuch as was very requiſite and proper for the producing of the Cicatrice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take</hi> the Leaves of Plantane two handfuls, Wormwood half a handful, the Leaves of the Olive, of the Maſtick or Lentisk Tree, the tops of the Bramble buſh, of each one handful; the Flowers Leaves of Betony half a handful; the Flowers of Camomile, Melilote, St. Johns-wort, Sticha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, Caſſidony or French Lavender, red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Roſemary flowers, the Leaves and Grains of Myrtle, of each one handful; boyl al theſe in a ſufficient quantity of Water; and add in the end of red aſtringent Wine one pottle: make a Fomentation herewith for the part affected, and apply it twice a day. But when as this had firſt of all appeared plainly to be leſs effectual than was expected, and not to be ſufficiently helpful; we then made uſe of this other that followeth. <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take</hi> Centaury the leſs one handful; red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes one pugil and an half; Myrrh groſly pouder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three drams; Roch Allum one ounce; boyl them all together in thick red Wine for a fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then let them be filtatred, and hard preſſed, according to the uſual manner.</p>

Of the ſtraining we ordered them (with a ſraight Syringe, Squirt, or Injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pipe) to caſt into the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer being firſt of all throughly cleanſed and purified: which cleanſing was indeed wholly effected and wrought by the fore-ordained Injections, but more ſepeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally likewiſe (and moſt ſpeedily) with this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent; for it hath an admirable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent virtue in the cleanſing of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers from all their thin Ichorous excrements and impurities: the Ingredients that it conſiſteth of are theſe that follow:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take</hi> Juyce of Smallage half a pint (this is admirable in cleanſing of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers) the beſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney four ounces; Barley meal two ounces; of the bitter Vetch Orobus half an ounce; Choyce Myrrh two drams; Turpentine one ounce and half; let them be boyled al together, and make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent; in which let Linen Rags be wel wet, and then put into the Cavities of be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer; in purgeth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers moſt excellently, and without any biting at al.</p>
                  <p>For the filling up of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer with fleſh, we made uſe of this following Emplaſter:</p>

                     <hi>Take</hi> Litharge of Gold ſix ounces; Oyl of Roſes Omphacine one pint and half; Vinegar of Roſes half a pint; boyl them together with a gentle fire (continually ſtirring them about with a Spatter) until they ſhal have gotten a blackiſh color, and the conſiſtence or thickneſs of ſoft Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Clay, and a Cerot. Make a long Roller-like Emplaſter, of which make an Emplaſter fit for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, and lay it upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer. But in the end and concluſion of the Cure, we made uſe of the Emplaſter Diachalcitis with the Emplaſter of Diapompholyx: in the curing of which ſo great and hollow an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer (after the throughly cleanſing of the ſame) we found by good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that there was nothing could be better and more available then the applying of pillows or bolſters (a little thicker than ordinary) round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſaid <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer; and ſo binding theſe bolſters on very hard ſtrongly to preſs down into the fleſh lying underneath that other fleſh that lay gaping far disjoyned from it: for (as Experience then taught us) this (if there be any thing that will do it) doth moſt eſpecially procure agglutination and ſodering together.</p>

                  <p>FIſtula's differ from a Sinuous and furrowed Ulcer only in this, to wit, That they are moreover callous and hard; and therefore here after ſinuous Ulcers we think it fit to treat o Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula's. If the <hi>Sinus</hi> or nook be not ſpeedily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the <hi>Pus</hi> wil moreover cauſe furrows, ſuch as we uſually term Coney-burrows; and the part wil contract a callouſneſs, or thick inſenſible brawnineſs; and it wil become ſo hard that it can by no manner of means be agglutinated and united again unto the parts lying underneath; which Malady is after this called a Fiſtula. For a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula is a <hi>Sinus</hi> (nook, or furrow) narrow and long, or a Sinuous ulcer, that is (for the moſt part) narrow and callous; and thereupon ſuch as wil hardly admit of any Cure.</p>

                     <p>But now theſe Fiſtula's for the moſt part have their original from Impoſtumes. For theſe (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of the impurity of the body, or the too great abundance of naughty humors) if they
<pb n="2564" facs="tcp:49110:91"/> be permitted long to continue; or elſe if by the unskilfulneſs of the Phyſitian they ſhal be over long delayed, and not wel cured, the <hi>Pus</hi> then cauſing the aforeſaid Coney-furrows, they wil at length become very deep, and withal callous, and of an inſenſible brawny hardneſs.</p>

                     <p>There is moreover of Fiſtula's very great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and diverſity.

                     <p>But now theſe Fiſtula's (in the general) are known eſpecially by the Probe or Inſtrument that is conveyed into the <hi>Sinus</hi> (to diſcover the depth thereof) which how it tendeth and paſſeth along, and how deeply it penetrateth it eaſily ſeen and diſcerned. And withal when the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtrument is drawn forth, we may then eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learn, whether the Fiſtula be moiſt, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be dry. But if it be oblique, ſo that the Inſtrument cannot paſs along in a direct and ſtraight manner, we then are wont to put in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle long plummet of Lead, or rather (which is much the better) a Wax Candle, that may be turned about any way. And moreover, that fleſh that lieth round the Fiſtula appeareth to be white, dry, hard, and without pain; or elſe if there be any pain, it is very little and moderate, unleſs, haply it be neer unto a Nerve; and the <hi>Pus</hi> that iſſueth forth is crude and raw, and ſomtimes likewiſe very ſtinking &amp; loathſom. But now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no there be one, or more of theſe <hi>Sinus's,</hi> this is altogether to be diſcovered by the Probe or ſearching Inſtrument; which the <hi>Pus</hi> likewiſe that is now and then ſent forth wil ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. For if there flow forth more <hi>Pus</hi> then what probably can be contained and generated in one only <hi>Sinus,</hi> or hollow Nook; or if when the ſick Perſon removeth and changeth his ſeat, that <hi>Pus</hi> that before was ſtopped ſhal begin again to flow forth; this may be a ſure and certain ſign and token that there are here preſent more then one of the <hi>Sinus</hi>'s and that the Fiſtula penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very deep. But if there are more orifices of the Fiſtula, then we cannot ſo eaſily diſcover by the Inſtrument, whether there be one only Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, or more: but then by a Syringe, Pipe, or Squirt, liquor is to be injected by one orifice; the which liquor if it flow forth again by all the orifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then it is al but one Fiſtula: but if it iſſueth not forth at all the orifices, then there are more Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's then one. And this is likewiſe diſcovered by the colour of that that iſſueth forth: for if that humidity that floweth forth by all the orifices be of one and the ſame colour, it is then a ſign that the Fiſtula is but one; but if it be of a different colour, it is then an argument that there are more Fiſtula's then one. But how far the Fiſtula's reach, and in what part they end, it may thus be known. If that which is touched by the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſoft, and the <hi>Pus</hi> that floweth forth be white, and in great abundance, it then ſheweth that the Fiſtula ſticketh in the Skin alone. But if it penetrate and reach even unto the Nerve, then there wil be great pain perceived when the depth of the <hi>Sinus</hi> is ſearcht unto; and the <hi>Pus</hi> that is evacuated is indeed white, but then it is very thin, and in leſs plenty; and the action of that Member unto which the Nerve tendeth, is rendred more difficult. If it penetrate unto a Bone, there is then preſent a pain in the very time of making the tryal and diſcovery; and that unto which the loweſt end of the ſearching Inſtrument reacheth is hard, and maketh reſiſtance. And the Bone is then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed found and perceived to be equal and ſmooth, if it be not as yet become rotten and corrupted; but if putridneſs hath ſeized even upon the Bone it ſelf alſo, it then appeareth rough and unequal unto the touch; and the <hi>Pus</hi> flowing forth wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth black, and is of a very ill ſavor. But if the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> reach unto a Vein, or an Artery, and this Vein or Artery be not indeed corroded and eaten through, then there is ſomthing iſſuing forth that is like unto Feces or Dreggs. For the Blood ſweating through by the Pores of a Vein, or an Artery, is mingled together with the humidity of the Ulcer; and thence it is, that what floweth forth appeareth feculent, or dreggy. But if the Vein or the Artery be eaten through, then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there wil blood break out, and flow forth: and this wil be very red, and with a kind of leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or dancing motion, and with a tickling, if it come from an Artery; but more thick and dark, if it iſſue forth from a Vein.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Simple or ſingle Fiſtula's that are yet but new begun, which are in the fleſhy parts alone, not deep, in young vigorous bodies, and ſuch as are of a good Conſtitution, are eaſily cured; but more difficultly thoſe wherein many parts are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded, and eaten quite through, ſuch as are old and inveterate, without any ſenſe and feeling, deep, ful of turnings, and having divers and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent hollow Nooks; ſuch as are neerly ſituate unto noble and principal Members; and when they are in old and decaied bodies, and ſuch as abound with ill humors.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And ſo are thoſe (in like manner) very dangerous, and hardly cured (or rather indeed
<pb n="2565" facs="tcp:49110:91"/> altogether incurable) that reach even unto the heads of the Muſcles, unto the Veins, unto the Arteries, unto the Nerves, the Bones, the Joynts, and the very Vertebrae of the Back; that reach and extend unto the Cavities of the Bellies, as the Thorax, or the Abdomen or Paunch; or even ſuch as penetrate likewiſe unto the very Bowels themſelves, as the Lungs, Womb, Inteſtines, and alſo unto the very Bladder it ſelf. For why, ſuch like Fiſtula's as theſe, either they wil not bear nor admit of any Medicaments, or it may happen likewiſe that the Medicaments cannot poſſibly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and reach unto them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Yea ſome certain Fiſtula's there are that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ought not to be cured; to wit, ſuch as are old and inveterate, as having been of long continuance, and ſuch as are removed from the noble parts, and ſuch as by the ſuperfluous and vitious humors have now of a long time been accuſtomed to be purged and emptied forth. For ſuch like Fiſtula's as theſe (in regard that they preſerve men from divers Diſeaſes) are by no means to be cloſed up; becauſe that when they are ſhut up they cauſe and procure very many Diſeaſes; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath it, in his ſixth Book of Epidem. Comment. 3. Text 39. But on the Contrary, if they ſhal at any time chance to be cloſed and ſhut up, they are then again to be opened.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>Now the Cure of theſe Fiſtula's is twofold; one the true and perfect Cure; the other only palliative (as they call it) or imperfect, to wit, ſuch as wherein the Fiſtula is dryed up within, and conſolidated without, the <hi>Sinus</hi> nevertheleſs ſtil remaining. Which kind of Cure <hi>Galen</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to hint unto us in his Book of Tumors, Chap. 4. where he hath theſe words. <hi>Yet nevertheleſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the</hi> Sinus <hi>is ſtreightned and cloſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as being throughly dryed by the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; inſomuch that the part may ſeem to have attained unto a ſoundneſs no way to be found fault with. For evermore indeed, if any one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually uſing an exact and accurate Diet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by this means to have his Body very healthful and ſound, and very free from ſuperfluities, the</hi> Sinus <hi>then remaineth reſtrained and kept in. But ſo ſoon as any ſuperfluity is collected, and gotten together, it is again filled up; and ſo there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be again the ſame Impoſtume that there was from the very firſt; and ſo again it is evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated (as is fitting) with Medicaments, and then it is dried, and by theſe means it is reſtrained and kept in; and all this is evermore done with much more eaſe unto the ſick Party, then in thoſe that have the Impoſtume newly begun in them. For neither do the parts that are ſo far divided and ſeparated, yet feel, or are in the leaſt ſenſible of pain: for now although they are far diſtant one from another, yet nevertheleſs they are very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily filled up, the</hi> Sinus <hi>eaſily and ſoon receiving that that floweth unto it.</hi> And the truth is, <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente</hi> is of Opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion, that this kind of Cure is not altogether to be deſpiſed, and contemned; For ſometimes (as he writeth) this ſucceeded wel unto him, although not alwaies. Now the Cure is performed, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being firſt of all purged, and a fitting Courſe of Diet ordained; and afterwards the Tents and Fiſtula being taken away, and a new Spunge throughly ſoaked in a liquor that is ſtrongly dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being applied and faſt bound upon the place; ſuch as is the water of hot Baths, Ley, Lime-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the like. For by this means the mouth of the Fiſtula ſhutteth again together, ſo that the Fiſtula may ſeem whol and ſound; which indeed ſomtimes by the benefit only and operation of the Native heat doth altogether coaleſce and grow together again; but for the moſt part it remaineth cloſed up only ſo long as there are no ſuperfluous humors collected and gotten together in the body, for after that there is any humor again gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the <hi>Sinus,</hi> the Fiſtula is likewiſe again opened.</p>
                     <p>But now the true and genuine Cure of a Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la is thus accompliſhed. Univerſals in the firſt place are not to be omitted, but a Diet is rightly to be inſtituted, and the body throughly purged from all ſuperfluous humors; and eſpecial care is to be taken, that there may no more of the humor flow in unto the part affected. Which being done, before we deſcend unto Topical Remedies, there be ſome that adminiſter certain Potions that may dry the Interior parts, and ſtrengthen them, and that may prepare the Fiſtula for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation, and may throughly purge it. Of ſuch like Potions <hi>Tragaultius</hi> hath deſcribed two: the former whereof is this.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Agrimony three parts, Plantane two parts, Olive Leaves one part; Cut them ſmal, and bruiſe them wel, and then boyl them in white Wine;</hi> let the ſick Perſon drink hereof a ſmall Cup full (three or four ounces) every day. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oſmund (or Water-Fern) three parts, Gentian two parts, Centaury one part; boyl them in the ſame manner (as aforeſaid) in white Wine; which Potion expelleth and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth forth likewiſe Bones that are corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Others there are that commend this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Sanicle</hi> (i. e. <hi>Bears Ears, or French Couſlips) Mugwort, Speedwel, Saracen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, Winter-green, of each one ounce; Savine one ounce and half, Horſ-tail half an ounce; boyl them in white Wine, and make a Potion;</hi> which if we wil at any time make ſtronger and more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative, we may then (in the drinkng of it) unto each Doſe add and mingle therewith half a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Oculus Cancri</hi> (or the Crabs Eye) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
                     <p>For Savine, and Crabs Eyes, are of ſingular uſe
<pb n="2566" facs="tcp:49110:92"/> and benefit in the expelling and driving forth of corrupted Bones, <hi>Pus,</hi> putrified Veins, and the like. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Saracen Conſound, Sanicle, Speedwel, of each one ounce; Tormentil Root half an ounce; Avens, and Carduus Benedictus, of each an ounce and an half; boyl them in Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterward, before any thing elſe be done, we muſt do the utmoſt of our endeavor that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous hardneſs and brawniſhneſs may be removed. But now whenas the narrowneſs of the orifice of the Fiſtula doth for the moſt part hinder the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of thoſe Medicaments that are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred for the removal of the callous hardneſs, it is therefore to be dilated: which may be done either by fire, or by an Iron Inſtrument; or elſe more commodiouſly, and without pain likewiſe, by long ſharp tents that are made of Sea-Spunge, the pithy ſubſtance of the Elder-tree, the Roots of Gentian, Ariſtolochy, Briony, or even likewiſe of the wild Rape throughly dried. For theſe things being formed into a Pyramidal figure, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fiſtula the ſharp-pointed end downward, they ſoak up the humidity of the Fiſtula, and by this means they are rendered the thicker, and ſo by little and little they dilate and widen the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, without any pain at al. Which things are ſomtimes likewiſe ſoaked and anointed over with ſuch Medicaments as are in their own nature fit to take away the callous hardneſs, when the callus hindereth the dilatation. For there ariſeth a callouſneſs (eſpecially in the external orifice of the Fiſtula) to wit, in the very skin it ſelf, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as eaſily becometh hard, and ſuch as is made thicker than the fleſh, that is ſofter, and eaſily receiveth in the excrements, and the humors that flow thereunto. Yet nevertheleſs the very fleſh it ſelf ſomtimes likewiſe getteth a callous hardneſs in the cavity of the Fiſtula. The cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs that is in the orifice of the Fiſtula is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently apparent both unto the touch, and to the ſight. But now whether there be any callouſneſs likewiſe in the <hi>Sinus</hi> it ſelf, this may be diſcovered by the ſearching Inſtrument. For when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is put into it, there is then perceived ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little or no pain, and there is no blood at al iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth forth, but there is a certain hardneſs percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if a <hi>Callus</hi> be preſent. Which if it be abſent then there is a great pain excited, the blood flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth, and there is no hardneſs at all percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>But now whereſoever this <hi>Callus</hi> is, it is to be removed; which is done, either by Medicaments, or by Cutting, or by the Fire. But then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Medicaments are to be adminiſtred, ſomtimes ſuch as are mild and moderate (and ſuch are Emollients and Digeſtives) and ſomtimes again thoſe that are ſtronger, and ſuch are Deterſives or Cleanſers: and laſtly, now and then alſo, the ſtrongeſt ſort of al, and ſuch are Cauſticks. In thoſe that are but young, and in their youthful age, and that have their fleſh ſoft and tender, here Emollients and Digeſtives only are ſufficient, which do diſſipate the ſaid <hi>Callus,</hi> and the matter that is impacted and ſtuffed into the part that conſtituteth and cauſeth the <hi>Callus;</hi> unto which we may likewiſe (if there be occaſion) add and mingle therewithal ſome of the Abſterſive and Cleanſing Remedies. And ſuch are the aſhes of Figs mingled with the fat of a Gooſe; the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Fern Root, of Agrimony, of Olive leaves, the great Diachylon, and the Unguent Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum. But for the moſt part there wil be need of the ſtronger and more forcible Remedies, which by cleanſing, or likewiſe by burning do waſte and conſume the aforeſaid <hi>Callus.</hi> The ſtronger ſort of Medicaments are, the Root of <hi>Spondylima</hi> (we uſually cal it Cow-parſnep, or Meadow-parſnep) peeled and pared round about, Aſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del Root, Snakeweed, Briony, the Decoction of Lupines, and eſpecially (above al) the leſſer Centaury. There are ſome likewiſe that make uſe of the Root of black Hellebor; and this they put for three daies into the Fiſtula. But <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Chalmeteus</hi> pre-admoniſheth us touching this Root, and he tels us that it is a very unſafe and dangerous Remedy, and eſpecially if the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula be in any part of the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Cheſt. For when on a time he himſelf (as he ſaith) had once, and but once, filled with Hellebor a Fiſtula that was in the <hi>Spina Dorſi,</hi> neer unto the Region of the Heart, the ſick perſon very often fel into faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſwounding fits. Thoſe things that are yet ſtronger, are, the Aegyptiack Unguent, Vitriol burnt, Vitriol precipitate, the Oyl of Sulphur, Trochiſques of Minium, Chalcitis, and that which by the Apothecaries is called <hi>Miſy,</hi> and <hi>Sory;</hi> out of which there may be made Compoſitions for the preſent uſe. <hi>Celſus</hi> in his fifth Book writeth that this following is found by good trial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to be of ſingular uſe; and <hi>Paulus Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta</hi> doth the like alſo in his fourth Book, and Chap. 49. in which place we may ſee more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Ruſt and ſoil of Braſs twelve drams; Ammoniacum two drams; Let the Ammoniacum be diſſolved in Vinegar, and the aforeſaid Soil of Braſs therewith mingled.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>ſtrong Ley four ounces; the Decoction of Lupines one ounce; Honey of Roſes ſtrained one ounce and half; Allum half an ounce; and mingle them.</hi> If we mind to add any further vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſtrength thereto, to make it the more ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, we may then add half a dram of Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Mercury. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the beſt Wine Vinegar three parts; of the oldeſt Oyl two parts; Litharge one part; let the Litharge be bruiſed in a Mortar with Vinegar: and afterward let them boyl al together, until they have gotten both the color and conſiſtence of
<pb n="2567" facs="tcp:49110:92"/> Pitch; of which we are then to form long ſharp Tents, for the preſent purpoſe.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Litharge half a pound; boyl it in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Roſe water; and then ſtrain and filtrate it.</hi> Afterward,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Calcined Tartar as much as wil ſuffice; diſſolve it in deſtilled Vinegar: Mingle the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and make thereof that they term</hi> Lac Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum, <hi>or Virgins Milk.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Egyptiack <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent half an ounce; Sublimate half a dram; Ley one ounce; Roſe-water two ounces; Plantane Water four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and then let them boyl a little.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The green Water above mentioned and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed is likewiſe very uſeful.</p>
                     <p>But yet nevertheleſs, if the narrowneſs and depth of the Fiſtula hinder the fit application of theſe Medicaments (as for the moſt part it ſo falleth out) then the ſaid Fiſtula is either wholly to be opened, or elſe the Medicaments are to be injected even unto the very bottom thereof. When you have a mind to open the Fiſtula, then let the ſearching Inſtrument be firſt of al convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereinto, and ſo let it be opened upon the ſaid Inſtrument. But if it be not thought fit to open the whol Fiſtula, then Medicaments are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and theſe muſt be either liquid or dry. The liquid are injected by a Funnel or Squirt; and they are to be waſhed with Ley, Mulſum, Sea-water, Lime-water, the Water of hot Baths, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua vitae, or the Spirit of Wine; of which laſt this is by the way to be obſerved, that if it be mingled together with other convenient Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is then of ſingular uſe and benefit in the cleanſing and drying of ſordid Ulcers; as we may ſee in <hi>Valeriola</hi> his fourth Book, Obſervat. 10. and in his fifth Book, Obſerv. 1, 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>But the dry are made into a Pouder, and blown into the Ulcer by a Quil put into the mouth of the Fiſtula; eſpecially if the Fiſtula be but ſhort and within the fleſh: but if it be long, it may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be opened on the oppoſite part, that ſo on both ſides the Medicament may be injected. Where this is not to be paſſed over in ſilence (touching which we likewiſe gave you notice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Cure of <hi>Sinus</hi>) that we uſe our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavor, that the orifice of the Fiſtula may be open downward toward the Inferior parts, that ſo the Humors may the more freely flow forth; or if it be not open, then in that very place the Fiſtula is to be opened, unleſs there be ſome great and weighty impediment to hinder the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula.</note>But when notwithſtanding al the Medicaments the Fiſtula yieldeth not, neither giveth place at al unto the moſt prevalent Remedies that have or can be adminiſtred; and that ſomtimes in this caſe the operation of the hands bringeth more aſſiſtance, help, and benefit, we are ſomtimes likewiſe to betake our ſelves unto the Iron Inciſion Knife, and the fire it ſelf. To wit, the whol <hi>Sinus</hi> is to be opened; which yet nevertheleſs it wil not be ſafe for us to attempt in thoſe Fiſtula's that reach unto the great Arteries, or the Nerves, or the Tendons, or the Membrane that girdeth in the Ribs, or any other parts that are of the like Nature with theſe. But whenſoever this opening ſhal be judged fit and feaſible, the <hi>Sinus</hi> being then firſt of al ſearched by the Probe, or by ſome Liquor caſt into it, the whol (ſuch as it is) may be opened. The Fiſtula being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the callous hardneſs ought either with Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the edg of a Pen-knife, or a Razor, to be drawn forth, even ſo far until we come unto the good and ſound fleſh; which may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not only by the color, but even likewiſe from the blood, and the ſenſe of pain. The ſame kind of <hi>Callus</hi> (if it be extraordinary hard) may moſt chiefly be taken away with a red-hot Iron; this being done as with moſt ſpeed, ſo with the leaſt ſenſe and feeling of pain. But nevertheleſs the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e doth ſo terrifie and affright people, that few or none wil admit of this Remedy. But yet in the mean time while theſe things are in doing (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by Cauſtick Medicaments, or by the fire-hot Iron, or by the fire it ſelf) the part is al the while to be wel guarded round about, with ſome one or other Defenſive Cooler and Repeller, leſt that upon the exciting of pain an Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be raiſed.</p>
                     <p>The Fiſtula being thus throughly dried, and burnt, we are then to make uſe of ſome mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Medicament, and ſuch as may looſen and caſt off the cruſtineſs thereof. But if the Fiſtula reach unto, and end in a bone, this ſo ſoon as it is diſcovered by the Section, we muſt with al care and diligence pare and ſcrape away whatſoever we find to be corrupted and black in the ſaid bone: and this indeed muſt be but only in the very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the bone: for if the rottenneſs hath further corrupted the ſaid bone, then the ſcaly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted part thereof is to be cut forth with a Wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſs it fal forth of its own accord; but if the rottenneſs ſhal have penetrated even unto the marrow of the bone, then that that is corrupted is to be taken out with the Cizers that are for that purpoſe. But laſtly, if the Bone be wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, then al the whol bone is to be taken forth; which may indeed be done in ſmal bones; but it cannot be ſo done in others. The bone being now purged, thoſe things are afterward to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred that are called Incarnatives, viz. Such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments as generate and breed fleſh. Unto which if the Fiſtula give not place, it is then a ſure ſign that as yet al that that was corrupted is not wholly taken away. The Fiſtula is thereupon to be opened deeper, and the bone to be ſcraped with al the utmoſt diligence and care that may be, and then it muſt be further cleanſed. But if the Fiſtula wil not yet after al his be cured, we may without al doubt conclude, that it hath penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="2568" facs="tcp:49110:93"/> ſo deep into the body, that it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find out the end &amp; bottom thereof. And therefore the whol buſineſs is then to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and left unto Nature: which yet nevertheleſs we may likewiſe aſſiſt and help with Medicaments; for which end and purpoſe <hi>Nicholaus</hi> the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine preſcribeth this following, which (as he ſaith) wil both draw forth the bones that are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and corrupted, eat through the naughty putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied fleſh, and heal the Fiſtula.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Salt torrefied by the fire, Tartar, and Agarick; let them be made into a very fine Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and then this Pouder being tempered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Honey, let it be impoſed upon the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Callus being now removed and quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, if there be any thing ſordid and foul yet left remaining, we muſt then make uſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſive, and Sarcotick Medicaments. For which end, Pimpernel, Golden Rod, Centaury the leſs, the Root of Ariſtolochy, and the like, are to be adminiſtred.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Turpentine waſhed in the Spirit of Wine three ounces; the Juyce of Smallage three drams; Pimpernel half an ounce; Honey of Roſes ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, one ounce and half; let them boyl until wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh the one half of the Juyces be waſted away. Afterwards, add of round Ariſtolochy one dram; the meal or flour of Lupines three drams; Myrrh one dram: mingle, &amp;c.</hi>

Now there is extant (in <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius</hi> his fourth Century, and Obſervat. 85.) a Hiſtory of this varicoſe Ulcer, how it was cured: the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory he relateth in theſe very words. <hi>In the yeer</hi> 1589.

But it was notable to obſerve, that ſo ſoon as ever he lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his Leg on high, the blood immediately reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but the Leg being ſet again upon the ground the blood again deſcendeth, and that in a very moment; and (that I may tel you in a word) the blood ebbed and flowed, no otherwiſe then as if in ſome hollow Pipe or Conduit it had been caſt, firſt into this, and then into that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>

And then with a Thread twice doubled (which I conveyed in by a Needle that I crooked on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) I laid hold on the Varix; and in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the Varix I proceeded in the very ſame manner. But before ever I would draw the Thread cloſe, and tie the knot, I commanded that his Leg ſhould be again ſet upon the ground from off the Bench; and this I did to this end, that the blood might in manner as aforeſaid flow down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: for I much feared leſt that the Blood by reaſon of its ebbing and flowing being made very thin and ſubtile, ſhould here cauſe ſome inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, or other, &amp;c.</hi> See what further followeth in this Hiſtory, in the firſt part of this fifth Book, Chap. 44. in the Concluſion of the ſaid Chapter, in which we treat of <hi>Varices.</hi>

                  <p>IT happeneth likewiſe ſomtimes that a rotten and corrupted bone lieth under the Ulcer. Now Bones are corrupted, and contract a rottenneſs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from internal Cauſes, to wit, the long afflux of the excrementious humors unto the bones, or elſe the venomous quality and acrimony of the <hi>Sanies,</hi> or elſe by ſome hidden propriety; like as it often happeneth in the French Diſeaſe, that the very bones become rotten, the Skin in the mean time remaining whol and ſound. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſes are, the Ambient Air, eſpecially that that is cold, a contuſion of bruiſe, an Inciſion, and tart or ſharp Medicaments.</p>
                  <div type="diagnosis">
                     <head>Signs Diagnoſtick.</head>
                     <p>If the Bone be in the open view, the corruption thereof doth then eaſily appear, becauſe (as <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> writeth in his eighth Book, and Chap. 2.) that that is vitiated at the firſt appeareth almoſt as if it were fat, and afterward, either black, or rotten. But although the Bone lie hid, and do not in the leaſt appear, yet nevertheleſs its Corruption diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth it ſelf by certain Signs. And if a Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la went before, or that there were an Ulcer of a long continuance, then the Bone is corrupted by the touch of the <hi>Pus</hi> and the <hi>Sanies;</hi> touching which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thus writeth, in the ſixth of his Aphotiſms, Aphoriſm 45. <hi>If the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be Annual, and ſuch as return yeer after yeer, or if likewiſe they be of a long continuance, then there will neceſſarily follow an Impoſtumating and putrefying of the Bone, and the making of hollow Cicatrices.</hi> Moreover, he ſaith that ſuch like Ulcers are indeed ſometimes brought unto a Cicatrice, but that they are ſoon after again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, the Cicatrice being broken. For the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and the <hi>Sanies</hi> that ſweateth out of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Bone eateth through the Cicactrice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth the Ulcer. And therefore if there be any Ulcer ofen renewed, it evermore giveth us great cauſe to ſuſpect that there is one or more Bones corrupted, as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in his Comment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the ſixth Book of the Aphoriſm. Aphor. 45. and <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his fourth Book, and Chap. 10. And this is oftentimes to be ſeen in the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs of the Teeth, out of which there ſtilleth forth a <hi>Sanies</hi> through the holes of the Cheek or Jaw-bone, and there in the external part of the Jaw it exciteth and cauſeth an Ulcer: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may be, and oftentimes is healed, yet notwithſtanding after a very ſhort time the Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix is again broken. If ſuch an Ulcer therefore appear in the Cheek, and be there often renewed, the Teeth are then to be lookt into, and if there be any one of them rotten, it is forthwith to be brawn. For the Ulcer cannot poſſibly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="2570" facs="tcp:49110:94"/> and wholly healed, before the Tooth that ſupplieth the material cauſe unto the Ulcer, be drawn forth. Thirdly, the fleſh that lieth above upon the Ulcer is ſoft and flaggy; for it is made thus ſoft by the <hi>Sanies</hi> that ſweateth as it were out from the Bone: and ſometimes likewiſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh wan and Leaden-coloured by reaſon of the vitious humor that floweth forth from the Bone; in the ſeventh Book of the Aphoriſms, Aphor. 2. Fourthly, the <hi>Sanies</hi> that floweth forth of the Ulcer is more abundant then what is uſual, conſidering the bigneſs of the Ulcer; it is likewiſe thin, ſtinking, and of very ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in his third Book of Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Tit. 18. And if there be a dry Liniment put into the Ulcer, ſo that it may teach even unto the very bone; and the next day drawn forth again, it wil ſtink loathſomly. And laſtly, if the Probe or ſearching Inſtrument be conveyed into the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, even unto the very bone, then the ſaid Ulcer is not found to be ſmooth and ſlippery, and hard, but unequal, rough, and ſoft.</p>
                     <p>But whether this rottenneſs be deep, or only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial, <hi>Celſus</hi> in his eighth Book, and Chap. 2. teacheth us how we may diſcover it in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a ſlender and ſmal Probe be thruſt into the hole of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, it wil by its more or leſs entring thereinto give us ſufficient notice, whether the rottenneſs be in the top and ſuperficies only, or whether it hath deſcended deeper. The blackneſs likewiſe of this</hi> Sanies <hi>and rottenneſs may rightly be gathered from the pain, and from the Fever; which if they be mild and moderate, it is then an Argument that the ſaid rottenneſs hath not deſcended very deep: but when the aforeſaid Symptoms are great, then the rottenneſs hath gotten down very low and deep; but it wil appear yet more manifeſtly, by turning about the Wimble in it. For there is then an end of what was amiſs, when there ceaſeth to come forth any more of the black ſcurſineſs.</hi> Thus <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>Beſides the Indications that the Ulcer affordeth us, the rottenneſs of the bone ſheweth us likewiſe that what is corrupted muſt be wholly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: for neither can that that is dead be by any means corrected, and amended. For that which is in the fleſh and ſoft parts, we call it <hi>Sphace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> but if it be in the bone, it is then rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>But now that the corrupted bone may be taken away, it is firſt of all to be cleanſed, and then made bare (if it be covered with fleſh) the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer being cut off. But nevertheleſs (as we told you erewhile) there cannot oftentimes any Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Cutting be adminiſtred, by reaſon of the Nerves, Muſcles, Tendons, Arteries, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Veins. The bone is therefore then (as much as may be) to be cleanſed with a Gentian, or Rape root, tenderly conveyed into the Ulcer. The fleſh likewiſe that lieth at the top of the bone may be conſumed by a Cauſtick Medicament, or by any potential Cautery, and ſo the bone may be bared in the ſame manner as Iſſues are wont to be excited.</p>
                     <p>The corrupted bone when it is made bare, it is then to be taken away either by Chirurgery, or by Medicaments. We muſt of neceſſity make uſe of Chirurgery, when the Corruption of the bone is more deep, and not in the Superficies; or when we deſire a quick and ſpeedy Cure, as in the bones of the Thorax. For Nature doth but very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparate the corrupted bones, and ſcarcely (now and then) in the ſpace of thirty five, or fourty daies. And therefore this ſeparation of the corrupted bone from the ſound may otherwiſe be aſſaied by Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>Now thoſe Medicaments that ſeparate the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt bone from the ſound ought to be very dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſo they may conſume the ſuperfluous humidities in the corrupted bone, and that they may likewiſe dry even the very bone that is found, that ſo the Expulſive faculty may ſeparate from it that that is vicious in it; and that the oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique or bone-breeding faculty may generate a bone, or at leaſt a <hi>Callus,</hi> that may thruſt forth the bone that is corrupted.</p>
                     <p>The milder ſort of Remedies (for this purpoſe) are the Root of Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fennel,<note place="margin">Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in caſe the Bone be corrupted</note> white Briony or white wild Vine, Flowerdeluce, Myrrh, Aloes, Alum. The ſtronger ſort, are, the Root of round Ariſtolochy, of Water-dragons, the Rind of Allheal, of the Pine Tree, the Pumice ſtone burnt, the droſs and refuſe of Braſs, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Chryſocol, and the Spirit of Wine.

                     <p>Of thoſe Medicaments there are Compounds to be made, which are to be applied either in the form of a Pouder; or elſe mingled with Honey, Roſin, Wax, Unguent Aegyptiack, or ſome other ſuch like Unguent, and ſo applied in the form of an Unguent.</p>
                     <p>This following Pouder is very efficacious; Viz.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Root of round Ariſtolochy, Flowerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce, Myrrh, Aloes, the Rind of Alheal, the refuſe of Braſs, the rinds of the Pine-tree, equal parts of al: let them be al mingled together, and made up with Honey into the form of an Unguent.</p>
                     <p>This Pouder following is likewiſe very much approved of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Mummy, and Sarcocol, of each half a dram, Euphorbium one dram, and make a Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the Root of round Ariſtolochy, of Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fennel, of each half an ounce; the rinds of the Pine-tree two drams; white Agarick, Earthworms prepared, of each one dram and half; Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium one dram; make a Pouder, or an Unguent with Honey of Roſes; as likewiſe this Oyl:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Citrine Sulphur one pound; put it neer unto a gentle fire that it may melt; unto which add, of burnt Tartar made into Pouder half a pound; mingle them with continual ſtirring until they are cold. Afterward let them be pulveriſed, and ſet in a moiſt place upon a ſtone until they melt; and with this Oyl let the corroded bones be anointed. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the Root of long Ariſtolochy, Briony, Sow-fennel, Flowerdeluce of Florence, of each one dram, Euphorbium one ſcruple; make a Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſtrew it upon the bone. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> Pouder of the Root of Sow-fennel, of round Ariſtolochy, of Opoponax, and Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium, of each half a dram; Turpentine an ounce and half, Wax half an ounce; boyl them to the conſiſtence of a Cerote. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the Roots of both Ariſtolochies, of Brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of Sow-fennel, of Florentine Flowerdeluce, of each half an ounce; Centaury the leſs, the Rind of the Pine-tree, of each three drams; Aloes two drams, flour of Braſs a dram and half: unto al the aforeſaid pour of the Spirit of Wine as much as wil ſuffice, and extract the Tincture.</p>
                     <p>But if the corruption of the Bone be ſo great that it cannot be wholly taken away by Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then there wil be need of Chirurgery; and the corrupted bone is to be taken away, either by ſhaving and paring off, or elſe by burning. Now for the abraſion or paring it away, there are here two Inſtruments that are made uſe of; the ſcraping Iron Inſtrument, and the Wimble or Anger. The former of there taketh place, when the bone is not ſo deeply corrupted; but the Wimble is to be uſed when the rottenneſs hath penetrated very deep into the bone. Of ſhaving or paring, <hi>Celſus</hi> in his eighth Book, and Chap. 2. thus writeth: <hi>He that ſhaveth theſe rotten Bones</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>muſt with al bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and courage make an impreſſion with his Iron Inſtrument, that ſo he may do ſomwhat, and may the ſooner make an end. The end is then, when we come either unto a bone that is white, or unto a bone that is ſolid: for it is manifeſt by the whiteneſs of the bone that the fault in regard of the blackneſs is cured; and by that ſame ſolidity it is likewiſe manifeſt that what was amiſs in the bone in regard of the rottenneſs, is in like manner ended. We alſo told you before that unto the ſound and whol bone there wil be ſome ſmal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Roſie freſh-colored blood. But if at any time it deſcend deeper, we may wel queſtion both of them, as very doubtful: as for the rottenneſs, our knowledg is indeed therein ſomwhat quicker. A ſmal and ſlender Probe is put down into the hole, which by its entering more or leſs, ſheweth unto us whether the rottenneſs lie in the top, or whether it be deſcended deeper. The blackneſs may likewiſe indeed be gueſſed at (if not certainly known) from the pain, and from the Feaver; which if they be mild and moderate, then we may conclude that the ſaid blackneſs is not deſcended very deep; but yet nevertheleſs it is made more manifeſt when we come to make uſe of the wimble; for there is then an end of what was amiſs, when there ceaſeth to come forth any black duſt. And therefore if the rottenneſs hath deſcended deep, we ought then to make many holes (with the wimble) as deep as that that is amiſs in the bone: and then into thoſe holes burning hot Irons are to be let down, until at length by this means the bone be wholly dried. For withal (after this) both whatſoever is vitiated and corrupted wil be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened from the lower bone, and that hollow nook wil be filled up with fleſh: and the humor that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward iſſueth forth wil be either none at al, or certainly very little. But if there be any black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or if the rotteneſs be likewiſe paſſed over unto ſome other part of the bone, it then ought to be cut out; and this ſame may likewiſe be done in the rottenneſs penetrating into ſome other part of the bone: but that which is altogether vitiated muſt be wholly taken forth: if the inferior part be whol and ſound, then only ſo far as there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corrupted, it ought to be cut forth. And alſo whether the Breaſt-bone, or whether it be a Rib that is rotten, it is rendered by this fault unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therefore there is a neceſſity of cutting it forth.</hi> Thus <hi>Celſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By al which it appeareth, That the Ancients after the paring and ſhaving of the bone were wont likewiſe to burn it, this burning being the
<pb n="2572" facs="tcp:49110:95"/> chiefeſt remedy for the conſuming of al the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humidity. But then notwithſtanding in the applying of a Cautery we muſt alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, leſt that the fleſh that lieth neer be likewiſe burnt together with the corrupted bone: and therefore the Cauteries are to be applied through Iron pipes, by which the fleſh is to be defended and ſafeguarded; of which Iron pipes we ought to have many in readineſs, that ſo after one is grown hot, another that is cold may be applied; or if we think good to make uſe of one only, then as oft as it is hot we may put it into cold water to cool it. And whatſoever of the humor ſweat forth out of that bone, it is to be cleanſed and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away with a Spunge or a Linen cloth, leſt that otherwiſe it corrupt the neerly ſcituated parts. After the burning, we are then in the firſt place to apply Roſe-water with the white of an Egg, for the preventing of the Inflammation, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating of the pain; afterward we are to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Oyl of Roſes with the Yelk of an Egg; and then after this, Butter with Honey of Roſes. But unto the bone that is burnt, the Pouder of the Root of Sow-fennel, of Ariſtolochy, Euphorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um (or ſome other of the forementioned Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) is to be impoſed and laid upon the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bone, until the ſaid bone be ſeparated, and parted.</p>
                     <p>After the taking forth of the corrupted bone, ſome drying Pouder (and ſuch as are called Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick Pouders) is to be ſtrewed upon the place. After this the Ulcer is to be filled up with fleſh; and at length to be cloſed and ſhut up with a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrice.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THere are Ulcers likewiſe that are here and there in the Writings of Phyſitians termed <hi>Dyſepulote</hi> Ulcers, <hi>Cacoethe, Telephia, Chironia,</hi> and <hi>Phagedaena;</hi> which what they are, we ſhal in this and the following Chapter explain unto you. And in general, al thoſe Ulcers may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Dyſepulote</hi> (or hardly healed) that are not to be cured without much difficulty, and ſuch as are not cloſed up with a Cicatrice without much ado. Touching the right curing of which <hi>Galen</hi> wrote both the fourth Book of his Method of Healing, and his fourth Book of the Compoſition of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments according to their kinds. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed happeneth for four cauſes, as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in his fourth Book of the Method of Healing, Chap. 1. For of thoſe Ulcers that are hardly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and rebellious, ſome of them are made ſuch by reaſon of the diſtemper in the ulcerated part, and others of them become ſuch by means of the humor flowing in unto them. But now this very diſtemper may again be ſaid to be twofold, ſince that the ſubjected fleſh is ſomtimes ſuch as hath exceeded the bounds of Nature, in the quality on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but ſomtimes likewiſe with a certain neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tumor or ſwelling. And in like manner, the afflux of humors admitteth of a twofold diviſion; to wit, into, Firſt the bad and depraved quality, and ſecondly, the exceſſive quantity of the humor or juyce that floweth in. But in the mean while, either ſome, or elſe al the aforeſaid Affects are alike and indifferently mingled together. Yet nevertheleſs, the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> in the ſixth of the Aphoriſms, Aphor. 45. addeth a fifth cauſe; where he writeth, That Ulcers retrain a long time, not only becauſe of the afflux of humors, or by reaſon of any diſpoſition in the Member contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the humors flowing in; but alſo (thirdly) by reaſon of ſome paſſion of the bone that is corrupted in that place. For although Ulcers that have a corrupted bone lying under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them may ſomtimes be cured and covered over with a Cicatrice: yet notwithſtanding that foundneſs is not firm, and of any continuance, but the Ulcer is afterward again renewed; and this happeneth ſo long as the rotten bone remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth unhealed.</p>
                  <p>And yet nevertheleſs, <hi>Galen</hi> in his firſt Book of the Compoſition of Medicaments according to their kinds, Chap. 18. diſtinguiſheth between theſe <hi>Dyſepulote</hi> Ulcers, that is to ſay, ſuch as are hardly brought to a Cicatrice,<note place="margin">Malignant ulcers.</note> and the Ulcers <hi>Cacoethe</hi> or Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and he calleth ſuch of them <hi>Dyſepulote,</hi> that ariſe from the conflux of either many or ſharp humors; without this, that the part affected hath already ſuch a diſpoſition, that although that that floweth in ſhould be good, yet notwithſtanding it corrupteth it: now thoſe Ulcers that have already gotten this aforeſaid diſpoſition, he calleth <hi>Cacoethe,</hi> or malignant. So that al thoſe Ulcers that are hardly cured (from what cauſe ſoever it be) may in general be called <hi>Dyſepulote</hi> Ulcers; and now in ſpecial likewiſe thoſe that are ſo made, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved diſpoſition of the part affected. But in regard that al the differences and cauſes of Ulcers hardly cured have hitherto been explained, there is no need that we add any thing more concerning them.</p>
                  <p>And yet nevertheleſs, there is one cauſe of thoſe Ulcers that are hardly curable that I have ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obſerved, which I think it not fit here alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to paſs over in ſilence. It happeneth very often, that in long continued Ulcers the skin is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated, and the fleſhy panicle and fat is waſted: which if it happen, we may conclude that the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer is not healed, ſince that the skin can by no means be agglutinated unto the fleſh lying under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it: for when the Capillary Veins tending to the skin are eaten aſunder, they cannot then convey unto the skin that blood that is neceſſary for conſolidation.</p>

                     <p>And therefore in the firſt place, let the Ulcer be waſhed and fomented with this or the like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Phagedaena what it is.</note>ANd becauſe (as we have told you) there is likewiſe mention made of <hi>Phagedaena</hi> among the Ulcers; we ſhal therefore here in this Chapter explain it, and ſhew you what it is. It is ſo called from the Greek word <hi>Phagein,</hi> from its <hi>Eating;</hi> and this (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tumor or Ulcer) hath received its name from eating through and corroding, becauſe it eateth through the parts lying neer unto it. And indeed it is properly an Ulcer. But yet nevertheleſs, in regard that the Lips of the Ulcer ſtrutting forth with black Choler are lifted up into a Tumor, it is therefore by ſome referred unto Tumors; and there is mention hereof made by <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Tumors, Chap. 14. But we wil treat here of it among Ulcers. But yet nevertheleſs, as touching its name, this is to be noted, that it is not alwaies taken in one and the ſame ſignification. For ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us, in Epidem. 6. Comment. 3. Text 37.) <hi>Phagedaena</hi> ſignifieth an appetite unto, and eating of much meat, and hence (by the Author of the Medicinal Definitions) it is defined to be, a Conſtitution in which Perſons having an appetite unto much Food, and devouring much thereof are not able to retein and keep it; but when they have caſt it up, they again deſire more; and in this manner it is alſo defined by <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> in the third Book of his Chronic. Chap. 3. So that <hi>Phagedaena</hi> being taken in this manner, and in this ſence, is nothing elſe but that we cal the Dog-like appetite. And therefore <hi>Pliny,</hi> in his Book 20. Chap. 5. 13. and in his Book 30. Chap. 9. and Book 35. Chap. 13.) for diſtinction ſake (when he ſpeaketh of an Ulcer) is wont to add the name of Ulcers, and to cal them <hi>Phage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daenae</hi> of the Ulcers. And furthermore the name of a <hi>Phagedaena</hi> doth ſometimes ſignifie a certain kind of deſtruction that befalleth unto Bees; of which <hi>Columella</hi> writeth in his tenth Book, and Chap. 13. But here in this place we take <hi>Phagedaena</hi> as it is only an Ulcer; touching which <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Tumors, and Chap. 14. thus writeth; <hi>Whatſoever of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers there be that eat and devour, and reach unto the Bodies lying round about them, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eating through that that is ſound, all theſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are by the Greeks called</hi> Phagedaenica: <hi>but thoſe that are compounded of both (to wit, of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, and a Tumor, ſurrounding the fleſh) theſe are called Phagedaenae.</hi> Thus <hi>Galen.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alſo <hi>Herpes</hi> feedeth upon, and eateth up the parts lying neer round about; but the exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the Skin alone: but the <hi>Phagedaena</hi> (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Skin) reacheth even unto thoſe parts that lie underneath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nome</hi> is likewiſe a different Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſo called from the Greek word,<note place="margin">Nome.</note> ſignifying to <hi>feed;</hi> becauſe that it is wont to move forward (ſtil feeding the Diſeaſe) from the ſick and unſound parts unto thoſe that are whole and ſound, and of theſe ſound par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles it is wont alwaies to add ſomthing thereof unto the unſound; ſo that it hath its Appellation not from the ſubſtance of the thing declared and ſhewn; but from ſomething that is Acceſſary, which is to feed; as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in his fifth Book of the Method of Healing, Chap. 4. For <hi>Nome</hi> ſignifieth an eating or devouring putrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, albeit that the Ulcer creep but ſlowly. But <hi>Phagedaena</hi> is from humors that are ſharp and corroding, even without any putridneſs.</p>

                  <p>But what a <hi>Phagedaena</hi> is, we are now to declare unto you.<note place="margin">What Phage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daena is.</note> Now a <hi>Phagedaena</hi> in ſpecial, and properly ſo called, is an Ulcer that feedeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and eateth through the fleſh lying underneath it, and thoſe things that are about it; and then preying upon ſome what belonging unto the ſound parts, which it addeth unto thoſe that are diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unſound; as we may ſee from the ſixth Book of the Aphor. Aphor. 46, and in <hi>Galen</hi> his Book of Tumors, Chap. 12. To wit, the <hi>Phage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daena</hi> which the more ignorant Phyſitians call the Ambulative or walking Ulcer, is an Ulcer that is tumid and profound, eating through the parts ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer, and the fleſh that lieth underneath.</p>
                  <p>For it hath a Tumor about its lips, by which it is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Nome,</hi>

                     </note> which likewiſe eateth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the adjacent parts, but then it is without any Tumor. Although that it be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Nome,</hi> becauſe that in <hi>Phagedaena</hi> the Corroſion is only from a Malignant quality, and the acrimony of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; wheras in <hi>Nome</hi> there is likewiſe a putrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conjoyned. And it is alſo a deep and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Ulcer, and ſuch as doth not only eat through the Skin, but even through the fleſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; in which reſpect it differeth from the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi> that corrodeth and eateth through the Skin only.</p>

                     <p>About the Cure of this Ulcer it is to be noted (as elſewhere likewiſe we have often ſaid) that in it nothing wil any whit profit or avail (as it is alſo in other Diſeaſes) whileſt that the Cauſe ſtil remaineth. And therefore in the firſt place, ſuch a Courſe of Diet is to be preſcribed that will not only not generate ſuch like aduſt humors, but likewiſe qualifie and correct their acrimony: and afterwards theſe bad humors are to be evacuated out of the body.</p>
                     <p>And moreover this alſo is to be obſerved, which <hi>Galen</hi> likewiſe taketh notice of (in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleadged, <hi>Viz.</hi> in the fourth Chapter of his Book of the Compoſit. of Medicam. according to the kinds of them; upon the Medicament of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clepiades</hi>) where he hath theſe words; <hi>Rightly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath</hi> Aſclepiades <hi>added theſe words unto the end of his preſcribed Medicament;</hi> Viz. <hi>and looſen this every third day, and mitigate the pain with fomentations; and ſoften the ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter when you have waſhed it, and again lay it on: for unleſs the Medicament ſhal ſtick ſomwhat long unto the Skin, it effecteth but little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: which moſt Phyſitians are ignorant of, who think that if thrice a day they wipe away the</hi> Sanies <hi>from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, they then do better then thoſe that do it but twice a day.</hi> And the truth is, there is moſt commmonly a great error committed in this very point; whileſt moſt men think that they take the beſt courſe with the Patient, if they waſh ſuch a like Ulcer three or four times a day. But ſince that the Medicament doth not at all act any thing unleſs by the Native heat it be drawn forth into act, and in regard that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and long continued Ulcers the heat of the affected part is very weak, it needeth much time therefore to excite and draw forth the ſtrength and virtue of the Medicament. Wherefore the ſame Medicament ought to be kept ſticking upon the part affected a long while; neither is its acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be diſturbed, when the virtue and ſtrength thereof is ſcarcely yet drawn forth by the heat of the place affected (ſo that it now but beginneth to act) and a new Medicament to be applied. In which caſe notwithſtanding the condition of the humor exciting the Ulcer is to be conſidered.

This pain therefore in ulcers ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for the moſt part from a ſharp and corroding humor. But now whereas the pain is to be taken away, either by taking away the cauſe, or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by mitigating the pain, or by taking away the ſenſe thereof (as we have ſhewn you in the fifth Book of our Inſtitutions, Part 2. Sect. 3. Chap. 8. and likewiſe in the place alleadged) the laſt of theſe waies is not ſo ſafe, becauſe that it cannot be adminiſtred without great detriment unto the part; and therefore it is not to be put in practice but only in caſe of urgent neceſſity. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is moſt ſafe to take away the cauſe of the pain; or if this cannot be done but in a long time, and that there be cauſe to fear that in the mean time the Ulcer may be encreaſed and made worſe, then in this caſe Anodynes are to be made uſe of: which what they be, we have ſhewn in the place alleadged. Thoſe things that here much benefit, are, the Yelks of Eggs, Saffron, Turpentine, Oyl of Roſes, Roſin of the Fir-tree, out of which mingled together Liniments may be made, to be impoſed upon the ulcer. But upon the Compaſs or Circuit of the ulcer, the Fat of a Hen, of a Gooſe, of a Duck, the Mucilage of Linſeed, of Fenugreek, of Marſh-mallows, the Oyl of ſweet Almonds, of Cammomile, of Dil, and of Violets, are to be impoſed. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Mallows, Marſh-mallows, of each one handful; boyl them to a ſoftneſs, and then bruiſe them wel; when they are bruiſed and paſſed through a hair ſieve, add of Barley meal one ounce; Linſeed and Fenugreek, of each one ounce; Oyl of Roſes two ounces; Oyl of Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile and white Lillies, of each one ounce; the Mucilage of Marſh-mallow ſeeds, the extracted Water of the Elder flowers an ounce and half; Saffron one ſcruple; the Yelks of two Eggs: Make a Cataplaſm.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Crumbs of white Bread two ounces; ſoften them in Milk; and then add of Barley Meal, and Linſeed, of each one ounce; the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Camomile flowers half an ounce; Oyl of Roſes an ounce and half; Water-lilly half an ounce; the Yelk of one Egg, Saffron one ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: mingle them and make a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if at any time we have a mind to fit the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments unto the cauſe, in regard that moſt commonly in ulcers the pain ariſeth from hot and ſharp humors; therefore to take away this pain we may adminiſter the juyce or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Nightſhade, Plantane, Henbane, Sengreen, Oyl of Roſes, Whites of Eggs, with Roſe water: of his thoſe Cataplaſm that are made of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Plantane, Nightſhade, and Oyl of Roſes, are to be ſaid on; or elſe an Unguent of the white of an Egg, Oyl of Roſes, and Licharge, wel brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and mingled together in a Leaden Mortar, and afterwards boyled with the Juyce of Sengreen, until al the juyce be conſumed; or a whol Egg carefully mingled together with the Oyl of Roſes, and Turpentine, in a Leaden Mortar; or elſe the white Camphorate Unguent.</p>
                  <p>If neceſſity drive us unto Narcoticks, then the Oyl of Poppy, of Henbane, of Mandrake, of Frogs, or the juyce of Henbane, al or any of theſe may be applied with Milk.</p>

                  <p>ANd theſe things we thought fit (in a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way) to ſpeak of Ulcers in the (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; which any one may eaſily apply unto the ulcers of particular parts. Neither do we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be at al needful, that we ſhould ſpeak any thing more of the ulcers of al the particular parts, ſince that we have already treated of them in our former Books, as we ſhal by and by tel you. And therefore in this Chapter we wil ſpeak only of the ulcers of the Legs in ſpecial.<note place="margin">The Ulcers of the Legs.</note> For it oftentimes happeneth that bad and depraved Humors, eſpeciall the Melancholly, as wel by their own weight tending unto the Thighs, as by nature thruſt and driven down thither (as unto the external part) do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite ulcers; and this eſpecially happeneth after <hi>Eryſipelas's</hi> that very frequently inteſt the skin; and chiefly in Women, where without doubt there is a concurrence of ſomthing amiſs in the Womb: and I know that in ſome certain Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſuch ulcers are ſo familiar, that al the Women therein (although they ſeem to be otherwiſe very wel) have of theſe long continued ulcers in their Thighs. And therefore by al means poſſible we are timely to meet with, and prevent theſe ulcer. For unleſs they be ſpeedily healed, Nature wil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom her ſelf to ſend away al the vitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that are bred and heaped up in the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy unto theſe parts, which afterwards, if the ulcer be cloſed up, and the body be not diligently and often purged, wil excite other more grievous Diſeaſes, eſpecially in thoſe that are aged: for if they be neglected, they are wont likewiſe to gain growth and encreaſe, to corrupt the parts that lie neer, and to become callous; ſo that if ſome ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="2577" facs="tcp:49110:97"/> courſe be not taken for the healing of them, they afterwards become altogether incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Now that theſe ulcers may be rightly cured, firſt of al the body is to be throughly purged from the vitious humor; and the fault of the Spleen (which for the moſt part is here preſent) it to be corrected, and a Purgation oftentimes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
                  <p>And afterward the Unguent Diapompholyx is to be impoſed (which I have ever found to be moſt efficacious in this kind of ulcer) ſo long as until there appear a <hi>Pus</hi> good and white: and then this Emplaſter:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent Diapompholyx, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter Diapalma, the Emplaſter Gryſeum, of each one ounce; Gum Elemi two drams; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Saturn one ſcruple: mingle them wel in a Leaden Mortar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With which two Medicaments I have oftentimes happily and ſucceſsfully cured the long continued ulcers of the Thighs. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Ceruſs two ounces, Litharge one ounce, Oyl of Roſes one pint, Wax two ounces; let them be carefully mingled in a Leaden Mortar: afterwards add Tutty prepared with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Nightſhade, of Frankincenſe, and Lead burnt, of each one ounce; and let them be again ſtirred about in the Mortar, and then make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Wax, Roſin, of each one ounce; the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of a gelt Pig two ounces; Ship Pitch, Oyl, of each three ounces; Maſtick, Frankincenſe, and Myrrh, of each three drams; Litharge one ounce and half, Ceruſs half, an ounce. Let the Oyl, Roſin, Wax, and Suet, melt together and then let them be boyled unto a juſt conſiſtence: and after let the reſt of the Ingredients be added.</hi> Of,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>White Wax, Turpentine, Roſin, of each one ounce; Frankincenſe, and Maſtick, of each two drams; Styrax Calamite three drams; Gum Elemi ſix drams; round Ariſtolochy two drams; the juyce of Milfoyl, and Betony, of each half an ounce; Oyl of Roſes as much as wil ſuffice and make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let the Wax, Roſin, Turpentime, and Oyls, be firſt of al diſſolved together; after this let the Juyces be poured unto them; and when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to grow cool, add the Pouders. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Roſes twelve ounces; Ceruſs three on ounces; Litharge four ounces and half; Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, and Maſtick, of each half a dram; Dragons blood half an ounce; Myrrh, and Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocol, of each two drams: boyl them a little, until they be red; after remove them from them fire, and then dip therein an old Linen cloth; which when it is throughly ſoaked in the matter of the Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may be taken forth and ſpread abroad to make a Sparadrape.</hi>

                  <p>WE may not unfitly unto Ulcers ſubjoyn Burnings, which do likewiſe excite and raiſe ulcers. For oftentimes it happeneth, that by ſome miſchance and unfortunate accident the Members may be ſcalded, either with water, or with hot boyling Oyl, mor melted Metal; or elſe one may chance to fal into the Fire, into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or into ſcalding hot Oyl; which whenſoever it happeneth, then pain, bliſters, and exulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are excited.</p>
                  <div type="differences">
                     <head>The Differences.</head>
                     <p>Now of ſuch things as are burnt there are three degrees or Differences. For ſomtimes there is only a heat and pain excited in the part affected by the ſaid burning; and unleſs that Remedies be forthwith adminiſtred, the Scarf-Skin wil be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
<pb n="2578" facs="tcp:49110:98"/> from the true Skin, and bliſters wil be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in the which there wil be a certain cleer wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained: and oftentimes likewiſe ſuddenly and in a moment the bliſter or bladder is lifted up, and the very Skin it ſelf is burnt, dried up, ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and contracted together; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there is al this while no Cruſt or Eſchar produced: but at other times the very Skin it ſelf, yea and oftentimes the fleſh that lieth under it is burnt, dried up, and an Eſchar produced, and the Skin becometh black, loſeth ſomwhat of its ſenſe and feeling; and after that the Eſchar is fallen off there is left behind an ulcer ſufficiently deep. For fire diſſolveth the continuity, and exciteth a pain: and becauſe the moiſt parts in the Skin are reſolved by the force of the fire, and endeavor to exſpire and breathe forth, but are ſtil kept in by the thickneſs of the Scarf-skin, they lift it up, and raiſe the bladder or bliſter. But ſometimes again there is by the force of the fire ſome kind of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity left remaining in the part, from whence the Skin is contracted and drawn together: but ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo the moiſture of the part is altogether diſſiputed and dried up, and an Eſchar is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: and this happeneth according to the variety of the things that burn. For Water burneth leſs than the other; and this Water likewiſe more or leſs, according as it is more on leſs hot. For ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſtraw, flax, and the like, cauſe no great and vehement burning, unleſs the burning be long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. But Oyl burneth more, and ſo do Fats, Varniſh, Pitch, Honey, Wax. And the greateſt and moſt vehement of al burners, are Lead and Tin meltd, Iron and other Metals made red hot by the fire, as likewiſe the very actual Fire it ſelf, Gun-powder, and Lightening. And ſo likewiſe by how much the thicker the ſubject matter of the Fire is, and the more its force and ſtrength is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the concurrence of its many Atomes, and the more it is condenſed; and laſtly, by how much the longer the action of the Fire is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſo much the greater the burning muſt needs be. But if the fire be in a ſubject more thin, and ſo its Atomes be the more diſperſed, and but little united, and if its action likewiſe continue but a ſhort time, then the burning is ſo much the leſs.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="prognosis">
                     <head>Prognoſticks.</head>
                     <p>Touching the Diagnoſtick Signs there is no need that we ſpeak any thing at al; ſince that the burning wil ſufficiently manifeſt it ſelf. Its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees likewiſe, and how far it hath gone, wil ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appear by what was ſaid a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks: 1. By how much the lighter the Burning is, by ſo much the more eaſily it is cured, and ſo much the leſs is the evil that it bringeth along with it: but by how much the burning is greater, by ſo much the harder it is to cure, and ſo much the more grievous the evils that it bringeth along with it. For oftentimes an Inflammation of the part, yea even a <hi>Necroſis</hi> or Mortification (the Radical humidity being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and the Native heat diſſipated) ariſeth from thence, ulcers hard to cure are likewiſe from thence excited, the motion of the part is aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there are filthy and deformed Cicatrices left remaining.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Burning by Lightening is likewiſe very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and for the moſt part deadly.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By how much the purer the Body is, by ſo much the more eaſily is the burning cured. But if the Body be either Plethorick, or Cacochymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, then from the pain and heat there is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily cauſed an afflux of the humors; and from thence Inflammations, putrid ulcers, and other evils are excited.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Burning is likewiſe ſomtimes more, and ſomtimes leſs dangerous, according to the Nature and condition of the parts affected. For if there be but only one part burnt, there is then leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than if many parts, or the whol body be burnt. For when many parts, or the whol body be burnt, it is very rare that the perſons thus burnt ſhould ever be perfectly wel and ſound; but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they die miſerably by the very vehemency of the Symptoms.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If the burning be ſo deep that it reach even unto the greater Veins, Arteries, and Nerves, it is then dangerous. For when the exſiccated Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are contracted and ſhut up, the blood and the ſpirit cannot then flow unto the affected part; from whence there is cauſed an Atrophy, a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, and a deprivation of ſenſe and motion.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The burnings of the Abdomen are not cured without much difficulty: for the Skin is there ſofter; and thoſe Muſcles by reaſon of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious motions are variouſly extended and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If the burning reach even unto the Inteſtines, it is then deadly.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The burning likewiſe of the Groyns is very dangerous, ſince that thoſe places are moiſt, and therefore the more fit to receive the afflux of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The burnings of the Eyes are alſo dangerous. For although they be but light; yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they may produce either a ſtark blindneſs, or a deprivation of the ſight, or at leaſt a dimmuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If the hairy parts be ever a whit grievouſly burnt, they alwaies continue ſmooth and ſlick: for hairs are never generated in that hard Cicatrice that is brought over the affected part.</p>

                  <div type="cure">
                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>Indeed ſome there are that from the ordinary and wel known Axiom of Phyſitians (viz. That Contraries are the Remedies of Contraries) are of opinion, that ſuch Members as are burnt ought so be cooled; and therefore they think that unto
<pb facs="tcp:49110:98"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:49110:99"/>
                        <pb n="2579" facs="tcp:49110:99"/> thoſe parts that are burnt there muſt Coolers be immediately applied. But this their opinion hath its original from that vulgar but falſe Conceit, viz. That the burning is only an alteration, and the introducing of a hot quality; whenas notwithſtanding the very fire it ſelf, and likewiſe its Atomes, are communicated unto the part that is burnt, and an <hi>Empyreuma</hi> (as al of them are forced to confeſs) is produced: for what, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, elſe is this <hi>Empyreuma</hi> (which al of them tel us ought to be called forth) then the ſmal parts or particles of the very fire, that have pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated themſelves into the burnt part: and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience it ſelf teacheth us, That cold things wil not cure burnings; but that (on the contrary) by the ſaid Coolers (the fiery particles being thereby thruſt down much lower) the pain is wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly augmented, and inflammations, yea and the Gangrene it ſelf, and the Sphacelus excited: but that ſuch things as are hot, and that cal forth the <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> are very helpful: from whence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is (as we al wel know) that the burnt parts are not to be plunged into cold water, but rather to be put ſomwhat neer unto the fire. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that <hi>Platerus</hi> ſeem to find fault there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, yet uſe hath t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ught even the very vulgar the truth of this; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> long ſince took notice hereof, as appeareth in his Sect. 2. Problem. 56. Neither are thoſe things that are applied hot, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the nature of Anodynes, ſince that al A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodynes wil not do it, as by and by in the Cure it wil appear: but only thoſe of them which have virtue and power in them of calling forth the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreuma.</hi> But now ſimilitude and likeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth attraction; and the external fire calleth forth the incrinſecal fire, that is to ſay, that very fire that it ſelf conveyed into the burnt part; as <hi>Ambroſe Parry</hi> tels us very truly, in his Book 11. Chap. 9.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure therefore of Burnings, let the firſt care be to cal forth the <hi>Empyreuma:</hi> to wit, in the ſame manner, like as we have told you in Part 1. Chap. 15. touching Kibes, that the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts are not rightly cured if they be put neer unto the fire, or plunged into hot water; ſince that hence the pain becometh ſo much the more intenſe and vehement; yea and that oftentimes a Gangrene and Sphacelus are excited; but if they be firſt rubbed with Snow, or dipt into cold water, then the cold is drawn forth: ſo if the <hi>Empyreu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> be called forth by thoſe things that are hot (which is done by means of the ſimilitude or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) then this Malady is ſoon taken away. Which that it may be rightly done, the Cure is to be inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and ordered according to the degrees of the Burning above propounded.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of al therefore, if the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be but light,<note place="margin">The Cure of a light burning.</note> we muſt prevent what we can the breeding and ariſing of Puſtules or bliſters: for if this be done, the ſick perſon is then already freed from al the evil of the burning. But now this is to be ſpeedily done; and therefore whatſoever Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament we have ready at hand, we muſt forthwith make uſe thereof: and therefore the Member (if the nature and condition thereof wil ſo bear it) is to be put a little neer unto the fire, or elſe deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plunged into hot water; or elſe fomented with a Spunge, or a Linen cloth doubled, and then wel ſoaked in warm water, that ſo the <hi>Empyreuma</hi> by reaſon of the likeneſs may be extracted; or elſe immediately a Linen cloth dyed in Varniſh is to be impoſed upon the burnt Member; or a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloth wel wetted in the Ley or water in which unſlaked Lime hath been extinguiſhed. And then preſently Onions bruiſed in a Mortar with Salt are to be laid upon the burnt part: or elſe this Unguent. Viz.</p>

And then at length there is likewiſe a ſpecial regard to be had unto the parts affected, in the choyce of the Medicaments. For it wil be altogether unfit and improper to apply unto the burnt face thoſe Medicaments that are made of Onions, liquid Sope, as alſo Varniſh, in regard that the Eyes may hereby be eaſily hurt.

                  </head>
                  <p>INdeed a <hi>Gangrene</hi> and a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tumors nor Ulcers: neither (to ſay truth) is Sphacelus ſo much as a Diſeaſe; but only the very Mortification and deadning of the part; but then the Gangrene is a notable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Diſtemper, tending unto the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Mortification; which may likewiſe invade the Party without any Tumor at all; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding becauſe that moſt frequently it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth Tumors, and eſpecially Inflammations, there are ſome therefore that among Tumors do treat of the Gangrene, and the Sphacelus. But there are others, who (becauſe that when the part is Gangrenated an Ulcer neceſſarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereupon; and in regard that after the Spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celus there is an Ulcer left remaining) treat of the Gangrene and Sphacelus among the Ulcers: and theſe we chuſe to follow, and therefore it is that in the end of this Tract touching Ulcers, we thought fit to ſay ſomthing of the Gangrene, and the Sphacelus.</p>
                  <p>Now the Gangrene (which they call the Fire of <hi>Marcellus</hi> or St.<note place="margin">A Gangrene what it is.</note> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies Fire) is an imperfect Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification or Corruption of a part, tending unto a <hi>Necroſis,</hi> that is to ſay, a deadneſs or Mortification; unto which unleſs there be ſpeedy and fit Remedies adminiſtred for the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof, the Member becometh altogether dead, loſeth all ſenſe and life, and feeleth nothing at all, whether it be Cut or burnt: which <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> being already thus far perfected is by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines termed <hi>Syrderatio,</hi> and by the Greeks <hi>Sphace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> ſo that theſe two Maladies differ not but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their greatneſs. For in a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> the part is wholly deprived of all ſenſe and life, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together dead: but in a Gangrene there is not as yet preſent a perfect Corruption of the part. And in regard that in a Gangrene there is not as yet ſo great a Corruption, neither a perfect and abſolute Mortifitacion, therefore it only invadeth the ſofter parts: but now the <hi>Spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celus</hi> (in regard that it is a perfect,<note place="margin">The different between a Gangrene &amp; <hi>Sphacelus.</hi>
                     </note> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and abſolute Corruption of the part) doth not only invade the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts, to wit, the Skin, the fleſh, the Veins, the Arteries, and the Nerves; but it likewiſe corrupteth and ſpoyleth even the very bones themſelves. And yet nevertheleſs we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that in the <hi>Sphacelus</hi> likewiſe the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts are at firſt only corrupted, and that not the bones, but the Veins alſo, and the Arteries, and the Nerves, remain and continue ſafe and ſound; but yet if the putrid part be not ſpeedily ſeparated, it cannot poſſibly be avoided but that the more ſolid parts muſt likewiſe be infected with this putridneſs.</p>

                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>Whenas therefore in the Gangrene and Spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celus there is cauſed a Mortification of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; in the Gangrene indeed one that is but only beginning; but in the Sphacelus a perfect and abſolute Mortification; and that the mortification of the part dependeth upon the deſtruction of the innate and natural heat (as on the contrary, the life of the part dependeth upon the preſervation and ſafety of the ſaid Native heat) we conclude that whatſoever deſtroyeth the Native heat of the part, that ſame may likewiſe be accounted a cauſe of the Gangrene and Sphacelus. Now the Native heat is deſtroyed, when by its contrary it is either corrupted or ſuffocated, or diſſipated, or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extinguiſhed for want of Aliment. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by its contrary, either acting by a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt quality, and cold; or elſe by a ſecret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den quality, as by poyſon. It is ſuffocated, when the tranſpiration it hindered: It is diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a greater heat: It is extinguiſhed, if neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary food and ſuſtenance be denied: ſo that there are (as you ſee) five cauſes of the Generation of a Gangrene and Sphacelus: to wit, overmuch cold, a poyſonous quality, the hinderance of tranſpiration, a vehement external heat, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Aliment, and the heat flowing in.</p>
                     <p>For firſt of al we ſee that oftentimes (in the Winter) thoſe that take Journeys in the Snow and Ice have the extream parts of their feet, and of their hands, their Ears, and their noſtrils almoſt dead with cold, by reaſon of the vehemency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and thus it happeneth ſomtimes alſo, that by reaſon of Medicaments over cooling in a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone, or an Eryſipelas, careleſsly and incaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly adminiſtred, the part is taken and ſurpriſed with a Gangrene, or a Sphacelus: although I had rather refer this caſe unto tranſpiration hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a very great power of deſtroying the innate heat in thoſe things that are poyſonous, and ſuch things as deſtroy our Bodies by a ſecret and hidden quality. For ſomtimes the humors in our bodies do ſo degenerate, and acquire ſo great a malignity, that they bring a <hi>Necroſis</hi> or dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto thoſe parts whither they are by Nature thruſt, as we ſee it done in a Carbuncle. And ſo in like manner the biting and ſtingings of poyſonful Creatures do corrupt and putrefie the parts. And the ſame alſo is done by the Septick Medicaments, which if they be not wiſely and carefully admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred have in them a power of corrupting the fleſh; eſpecially in places that are hot and moiſt, as in the Emunctories, the privy parts, and the other places that are like unto theſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Tranſpiration hindered exciteth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Gangrene. For whereas our heat ſtandeth in need of perpetual ventilation and cooling, if this be denied, it is ſuffocated by the abundance of Vapors. And for this very cauſe in great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, and eſpecially in the moiſt parts, there very frequently happeneth a Gangrene, the Native heat being extinguiſhed; as otherwiſe likewiſe we ſee that a little flame is extinguiſhed and put out by caſting thereon good ſtore of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that the flame is ſtifled if it be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Cupping-glaſs that hath no hole or vent in it, or any other Veſſel whatſoever that is kept co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, which is preſerved in a Cupping-glaſs that is perforated, or any other Veſſel that is open. And this chiefly happeneth, if in Feavers (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they be malignant) the humor be with violence either thruſt forth, or that of their own accord they ruſh unto any one part. And ſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that here a certain Citizen that was taken with a malignant Feaver, from the humors that were thruſt down unto the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> had the ſaid <hi>Scrotum</hi> al of it ſo inflamed and mortified with a Sphacelus, that there was a neceſſity of cutting off the whol <hi>Scrotum</hi> or Cods, ſo that the ſtones hung down altogether naked and bare; which yet notwithſtanding (the Gangrene being cured) became afterwards covered again with fleſh that grew out of the Groyns. That Inflammation likewiſe which the Gangrene followeth is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſed by Wounds, and theſe not alwaies great, but oftentimes alſo very ſmal and ſleight Wounds, that ſeem inconſiderable, and of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So <hi>Henricus ab Heer</hi> relateth in the firſt Book of his rare Phyſical Obſervations, Obſer. 12. That he was preſent and ſaw a man fifty nine yeers of Age, who having pared the Nails of his Toes, and cut them to the quick, was preſently ſurprized with a Gangrene, and within a very ſhort ſpace died thereof. And he telleth us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of two other eminent perſons, who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have the hard and callous brawnineſs of their feet pared away, were both of them taken with a Gangrene that within a ſhort time cauſed their deaths. And this may likewiſe be done by Emplaſtick Medicaments, in great Inflammations, and eſpecially if they be unſeaſonably applied in moiſt places, which frequently produce there a ſuffocation of the Native heat.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A preternatural heat likewiſe, and ſuch as is extraneous and from without produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Gangrene, by waſting the Radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and the Native heat: and ſo many times a Gangrene followeth after great burnings.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, A Gangrene ariſeth from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Aliment, to wit, the blood, and the ſpirit flowing in, that is altogether neceſſary and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the cheriſhing of the Natural heat implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within. For whereas the innate heat ſtandeth in need of continual Nutriment (as the flame doth of Oyl) if this be denied, it languiſheth and is extinguiſhed; like as is the flame when the Oyl in the Lamp faileth. And in this manner a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene happeneth unto the external parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſomtimes in an Atrophy, Conſumption, and the like Chronical and long continued Diſeaſes
<pb n="2586" facs="tcp:49110:105"/> that extenuate the body. And for this very cauſe it is that when the greater Joynts are put out of Joynt, if they be not again wel and rightly ſet, then the disjoynted bone preſſeth together the veſſels that lie neer, and hindereth the influx of the blood, and of the Spirits into thoſe parts that lie underneath; from whence there followeth a lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conſumption of the ſaid parts, and in proceſs of time very frequently a Gangrene alſo. And ſo it is found by experience, that from a hard Tumor about the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> (where parting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral waies it deſcendeth into the Thighs) preſſing the ſame together, and hindering the deſcent of the blood into the Thigh, a Gangrene very often ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. And in this manner a Gangrene likewiſe happeneth, if any part be too hard and long bound about with Ligatures and bands; or elſe if Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that are over aſtringent ſhal be impoſed upon any part.</p>

                     <p>It is no hard matter to know the Gangrene For the color of the part beginneth to be changed and turned unto black, the fleſh to grow looſe and flaggy, the pulſe and ſenſe to be diminiſhed, and the heat to be aboliſhed. Which ſaid Symptoms the more the Gangrene tendeth unto a perfect cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and a Sphacelus, by ſo much the more are they increaſed and made more evident. For in a perfect and abſolute corruption and Sphacelus the life and ſenſe of the part are wholly aboliſhed; there is no pulſe at al to be perceived; the part, whether you cut or burn it, is inſenſible of pain; the fleſh appeareth to be cold, is made ſoft and flaggy, ſo that it yieldeth unto the touch when it is preſſed by the fingers; which yet nevertheleſs, after it is throughly dried, becometh black, wan, and altogether deadned, and it yieldeth a noyſom and ſtinking ſavor like that of a dead Carkaſs; and the skin if it be taken up with the fingers ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be ſeparated from the fleſh lying under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it. And here <hi>Ambroſe Parry</hi> adviſeth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Phyſitian, that when he hath diſcovered by theſe ſigns that there is a Gangrene, and a Sphace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, he no longer defer the doing of what is to be done, neither ſuffer himſelf to be deceived by the motion; ſome whereof is oftentimes ſtil left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining even in a mortified and dead Member. For in a Sphacelus the corrupted parts are moved, not by the motion of the whol and entire Muſcle, but becauſe the Head (and no more) of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcle is yet whol; the which while it is moved, it doth together with it draw the Tendon that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from it, and the tayl likewiſe thereof, although it be now wholly dead, and without any true and proper motion.</p>
                     <p>And theſe ſigns (that appear in a perfect cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Sphacelus) are ſtil the ſame in every one of them; whatſoever the cauſe be that it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its original from; whether it be from cold, or from a poyſonous quality, or from tranſpiration hindered, or from an extraneous heat, or laſtly, from the defect of Aliment; unleſs it be in this only that ſuch like Symptoms in a Sphacelus that hath its original from an occult cauſe and ſuch as is poyſonous (as for example, the <hi>Delirium</hi> or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the <hi>Syncope,</hi> and the like) are greater and more grievous. But in a Gangrene and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that is but yet now beginning, there is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a diverſity of the ſigns and ſymptoms, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Gangrene hath its original from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and different cauſes. For in a Gangrene that ariſeth from cold there ſuddenly appeareth an acute and pricking pain, and a redneſs in the part, which ſoon after is changed into a black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; and the heat that was in the part is extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; and there is perceived a coldneſs and ſtupidity (with a certain kind of horror) as it uſeth to be in (Quartan Agues. And moreover, in a Gangrene that proccedeth from a poyſonous and malignant humor in the body, which Nature thruſteth forth unto the external parts, there is preſent a continual Feaver, and a ſtrong conflict of Nature with the Diſeaſe; from whence the <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,</hi> Dotage, and the like, have their original; and ſuch a Gangrene as this ariſeth for the moſt part in the external Members, and the extream parts thereof, (as for inſtance, the great Toe of the Foot) with a certain Puſtule or Bladder, (under which there is preſent a black ſpot) which oftentimes is ſuddenly derived into the whol Leg and Thigh.</p>
                     <p>But that Gangrene that followeth upon great and extraordinary Inflammations (that proceed moſt uſually from the hinderance of Tranſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is known by this, That the freſh and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing color that is wont to appear in Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is turned into that which is pale and wan; that beating pain which before did infeſt now ceaſeth, the ſenſe is become dul, and there ariſe very great Puſtules that are ful of a thin ichorous excrement, like unto that that cometh from the waſhing of raw fleſh. Which appear almoſt the ſame, when the Gangrene hath its original from an extraneous heat. If laſtly, the Gangrene ſeize upon the part by reaſon of the want of Aliment, or through a dry diſtemper, then there is preſent neither pain nor inflammation, nor ſwelling, but rather a leanneſs, and the body is immediately cooled; and this Gangrene happeneth for the moſt part in thoſe places of the body that are the utmoſt and extream, as for inſtance, the Ankles and Toes. But when at length the Puſtules ariſe, and the part becometh pale and wan, then the pains likewiſe appear, and the Feaver is excited. But if the Gangrene happen by reaſon of hard ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Ligatures, then the part ſwelleth and it diſtended, and there ariſe greater Puſtules, ful of a thin excrement, reſembling the waſhing of raw fleſh: but the evident Cauſes we may eaſily learn and underſtand from the ſick perſon himſelf.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. That the Gangrene is a Malady very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is ſufficiently manifeſt unto every one. For unleſs it be ſpeedily cured, it degenerateth in a very ſhort time into a Sphacelus, and the part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh altogether dead. For this cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is not any the leaſt delay to be made; but help is to be afforded with al poſſible ſpeed: which may be done with leſs difficulty in a body that is as yet young, ſtrong and vigorous, where the vital ſpirits are as yet entire, and eſpecially where the Muſcles and Nerves are as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But that Gangrene which is with an afflux of poyſonous humors, and an occult quality, is more difficult to be cured than that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch afflux: for there are but very few that recover of ſuch Gangrenes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There are Gangrenes that are yet more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and theſe are they that begin in the moiſt parts: for the innate heat is ſooner ſuffocated in ſuch parts by the great ſtore of humors abounding therein.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And for this cauſe it is that the Gangrene that ariſeth in Hydropical perſons is likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldom cured, but moſt uſually it degenerateth into a Sphacelus; and that which ariſeth from the Antecedent Cauſe is likewiſe ever more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than that which hath its original from the primitive Cauſe; in regard that in the former the Bowels are more affected.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But a Sphacelus is yet far the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Malady. For the part that is taken with the Sphacelus can no way be reſtored and made ſound again; but it is forthwith to be cut off, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the part that hath life: which if it be not ſpeedily done, then the ſound parts that lie neer wil likewiſe be infected, and the putridneſs wil at length creep into the reſt of the body, from whence there wil be extream danger of preſent death; before which there uſually precede Dotings, Watchings, the <hi>Syncope,</hi> Convulſions, Ructures and Belchings, Sobbings, and a cold Sweat breaking forth over all the Body: and ſome of them die while they ate yet ſpeaking, and others of them die being as it were oppreſſed with ſleep.</p>

But if it be ſo that the part be not altogether ſtiff and ſtifled with cold, ſo that there be no longer any blood left therein, then it is forthwith to be welchafed, and rubbed with Snow; or the overcooled members are likewiſe to be throughly waſhed with cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, upon which they wil begin by little and little to wax warm, and to recover their former heat. Which the Inhabitants of the Northern Climates have much in uſe; who are wont when any Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers are overcold, ſtiff, and almoſt dead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, firſt of all to plunge them deep into cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and before ever they give them any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, to waſh and rub their Hands, Feet, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and other Members, with Snow. And that from the inward parts the heat may the more ſtrongly diffuſe it ſelf unto the external parts, and that all the cold may be expelled, it wil be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to adminiſter ſuppings made of Wine, and to drink Wine and Treacle mingled together. The aforeſaid People of the Seprentrional Regions uſe to give their Gueſts (when they are almoſt dead with cold) Hydromel, with the Pouder of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namom, Cloves, and Ginger, and the like Spices; after which they put them to bed, and cauſe them there to Sweat. For which purpoſe there be ſome that outwardly apply likewiſe unto the body Flagons or Stone Pots ful of hot water. Afterward when the pain and the coldneſs are ſomething mitigated, gentle rubbings with the hands anoynted with the Oyl of Camomile, ſweet Almonds, and Dil, are to be adminiſtred; and the parts are to be fomented with ſweet Milk, in the which there may alſo be boyled the Leaves and Berries of the Lawrel, Roſemary, Camomile, Sage, Organy, French Lavender, and the like. The Decoction of Rape roots is likewiſe ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly uſeful; and commonly unto thoſe members that are pained with overcoldneſs they uſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Decoction of Rape roots that have been firſt frozen with cold.</p>
                     <p>After this we muſt betake our ſelves unto thoſe things that are hotter, ſuch as the Oyl of Lilies, of Turpentine, of Wax, Nettle ſeed, Creſſes.

Which that it may the more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully and more eaſily be done, the malignant matter is likewiſe by Topicks to be drawn forth unto the external parts.</p>
                     <p>Where we are alſo to take notice, that if poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſtick outwardly unto the body (as it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth oftentimes from the ſtrokes of poyſonful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) then Defenſives are to be adminiſtred, leſt

                     <p>But if Poyſon ſhal chance unto the body from without, and ſhal either by a blow, biting, or any other touch be tranſufed into the part affected; then thoſe Medicaments that do ſtrongly attract the Poyſon, dry it up, and conſume it, are to be made uſe of: for which end and purpoſe, an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cautery may moſt fitly be adminiſtred.

                     <p>Take <hi>Vitriol one ounce, the tops of the Oake one handful, Frankincenſe half an ounce, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyre two drams, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine two pints and half; boyl them to the Conſumption of a third part, and then ſtrain them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Aegypriack Unguent is not alone to be applied, but upon the Unguent that Cataplaſm is alſo to be impoſed, which reſolveth, drieth, and hindreth putrefaction; ſuch an one as <hi>Johannes de Vigo</hi> in his ſecond Book, firſt Tract, and ſeventh Chapter deſcribeth and commendeth; and which many other Phyſitians and Chirurgeons now a daies likewiſe make uſe of. And all theſe are to be applied blood-warm; and they are ſo long to be continued, untill the putridneſs be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>But if the Malady wil not yield unto theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, then we are to have recourſe unto thoſe that are ſtronger, to wit, Cauſticks, ſuch as thoſe Trochiſques of <hi>Andro, Polyidas, Muſa,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fio,</hi> which diſſolved in Vinegar and Wine may be impoſed upon the part. Many indeed do here commend, and prefer Arſenick before all other Remedies; but <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius</hi> doth (and not without good Cauſe) reject and altogether diſallow of it in the Cure of a Gangrene, as that that not only hath in it a Septick and putrefying faculty, and a quality of melting the fleſh, as it were; but that likewiſe produceth very great and grievous Symptoms, vehement pain, Dotings, Syncope's, and the like, the malignant vapours being communicated unto the principal part. It is therefore more ſafe to make uſe of an actuall Cautery, as that which hindereth and preventeth putridneſs, drieth and corroborateth the part.</p>
                     <p>This is alſo much commended.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Mercury; diſſolve it in Aqua fortis; when it is diſſolved, precipitate it the Oyl of Tartar; after it is precipitated, waſh it.</hi> Or Mercury alone diſſolved and mingled with the Water of the Trinity Flowers; and wollen Cloaths wet in this Liquor may be impoſed on the part.</p>
                     <p>The Cruſt in what manner ſoever it be produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is to be taken away by thoſe Medicaments that have been above declared, in the firſt Part, and Chap. 13. touching a Carbuncle. Neither are we to wait ſo long til Nature ſhal altogether have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the Corrupt from the Sound, but the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Cruſt is with the edge of a Knife or a Penknife to be cut even unto the ſound part, that ſo there may be a way made for the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto the deeper parts, and the reſt that are corrupted. For if we expect until the Cruſt ſhal be freed of its own accord, it may poſſibly happen, that under the Cruſt a new putridneſs may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. The reſt of the Cure is in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be proceeded in, as is fit to be done in Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>

And unto the part it ſelf that is already affected with the Gangrene the Aliment is by all manner of means to be attracted. And therefore here there is no place left for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſives; in regard that they ſhut and ſtop up all paſſage of the blood and Spirits unto the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. And therefore we are not only to anoynt the part affected and the other members with the Juyce of Earth-worms, which is made of the ſaid Earth-worms firſt waſhed in Water, and then in Wine, &amp; ſo put into a great Veſſel with good ſtore of the Oyl of ſweet Almonds &amp; Violets, and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a gentle and moderate heat over hot Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and afterwards ſtrained (which is a ſpreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and ſoveraign Remedy in the Atrophy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of the parts) but the part affected is therwith likewiſe gently to be rubbed and chafed; unto which alſo Cupping-glaſſes not ſcarified are to be applied. But it wil be moſt fit and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, if there be already preſent a putridneſs, to
<pb n="2591" facs="tcp:49110:107"/> adminiſter thoſe things that do alike both attract and reſiſt putridneſs; ſuch as are, Salt Water boyled with Water-Germander, Liquid Pitch, with the meal of Lupines, of the bitter Vetch O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robus, Myrrh, and the like. But if the Gangrene hath already made any progreſs, the part is then to be ſcarified, and the Aegyptiack Unguent, and that likewiſe that is compounded of Pitch, and thoſe other things a little before mentioned, are to be laid thereon.</p>

                           <hi>A</hi> Gangrene from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terception of the blood &amp; ſpirits.</note>Moreover, If the Gangrene hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from the interception of the Blood, and the Spirits likewiſe, (whatſoever the Cauſe then be that thus intercepteth the blood and the ſpirits) it is immediately to be taken away; as, if the ſaid interception be from the bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the part, it is forthwith to be looſened; and withal thoſe Medicaments that reſiſt putrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as likewiſe thoſe that diſcuſs that that is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted (ſuch as are thoſe that are made of the Meal of Beans, of the bitter Vetch Orobus, of Lupines, Aloes, Water-Germander, and the like) are to be impoſed. And if the Gangrene hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gotten unto any heighth, the place is to be ſcarified; and thoſe other things that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in al Gangrenes, are to be done. If an aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and repelling Medicament be the Cauſe, the ſaid Medicament being removed, the heat is to be recalled by Frictions, Lotions, and Anointings. And ſo we muſt alſo proceed in the Gangrene that hath its original from other Cauſes that intercept the Spirits. For the Cure of the Gangrene it ſelf doth ſcarcely at al differ; the difference ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in the removal of the Cauſes. But if the Malady become to that, that the Member is now already altogether mortified and dead, and that it be ſphacelated, from whatſoever cauſe it be that the Malady hath its original, there is then one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of curing it. For ſeeing that what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together dead in the body cannot poſſibly recover life again, and that it hath now altogether the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a thing that is preternatural, there is this one only Indication, to wit, that it is to be taken and amputated from the body. Which if (by reaſon of the unfitneſs of the place) it cannot conveniently be done, then the caſe is wholly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. For ſome parts are much more fitly ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated for amputation than others; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the fingers, the feet, the hands, the geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals may be cut off with leſs danger. But if the Malady be in the Thorax or Cheſt, or in the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the parts cannot then be cut out, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if there be many particles of the Member at Once infected. For it ſomtimes ſo falleth out, that the whol Member is not to be taken away, but only ſome part thereof. But oftentimes indeed the whol Member is wholly to be amputated and cut off, to wit, when the putridneſs hath ſeized Upon and corrupted al the parts thereof round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: which in ſome may be ſpeedily done, and without any great danger, as in the <hi>Scrotum</hi> or Cods; but in other parts the amputation is ful of difficulty and peril; as in the Feet, Army, and Hands, But after what manner the ſaid ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and the taking away of that which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted is to be performed, we wil now acquaint you. Now this may be done divers waies; ſome there be that having firſt applied a Defenſive up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſound part, they then with many ſtraight and oblique Sections ſcarifie the dead fleſh that lieth neer unto the ſound; and this they do very deep, even unto the very bone. And afterward upon the Wounds they ſtrew the pouder of Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick and Sublimate, that ſo the mortified part may be ſeparated from the ſound. But in this way of extirpating the corrupt fleſh, Arſenick (as we lately gave you notice) is ſuſpected; and therefore in the ſtead thereof we are to adminiſter other burning Medicaments, of the aſhes of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprigs and unſlaked Lime. The Cruſt that is al over the part affected is to be taken away with a Pen-knife; neither muſt we expect til it be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of its own accord. Yet nevertheleſs, that the dead part may be dried, and be eaſily ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ſound, <hi>Fallopius</hi> applieth this Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radrape:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Aloes, Myrrh, Acacia, Gallia Moſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Alipta Moſchata, al the Saunders, Lign A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, Cumin, Allum, of each one dram; make a Pouder:</hi> Of which,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>one ounce; Ship-pitch, Roſin of the Pine-tree, Colophony, of each two ounces; Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, Maſtick, Styrax liquid, of each one ounce and half; Gum Arabick, and Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth, of each half an ounce: Let them be all melted; put a Linen cloth into the Liquor until it be throughly ſoaked in the Medicament.</hi> And afterwards let al other things be done, as it uſeth to be in other Ulcers. There are others that with an actual Cautery burn that that is corrupted, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven until there be a pain perceived in the part; and al other things are afterward to be done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to art.</p>
                     <p>But now <hi>Fallopius</hi> doth adviſe us (if much dead fleſh be to be taken away) not to make uſe of an actual Cautery alone, in regard that from the ſaid burning there wil be cauſed a moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable loathſom ſtench. Others there are that by Section and the Razor amputate that that is corrupted; and afterwards to avoid the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage, and to dry up and conſume the reliques, they apply likewiſe an actual Cautery, if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. But what hath hitherto been ſpoken tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this way and method of Curing, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only of that Sphacelus wherein the whol Member is not corrupted, and when there is no cauſe of taking away the Bone likewiſe.</p>
                     <pb n="2592" facs="tcp:49110:108"/>
                     <p>For if the whol Member be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,<note place="margin">The cutting off the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Member, when to be done.</note> and therefore to be amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; this cannot be effected either with an actual Cautery, or a Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; neither yet with a Razor; but there is a neceſſity of cutting off the whol entire Member, the Foot, the Hand, &amp;c. But in what manner this amputation ought to be performed, Authors differ much in their opinions concerning it. <hi>Celſus</hi> in his ſeventh Book, and Chap. 33. perſwadeth us to make the Section between the ſound fleſh and the dead; and rather to take away ſome of the ſound, than to leave any of the dead fleſh remaining, left the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady that is left corrupt that that is ſound. Which way of curing moſt of our late Phyſitians diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, by reaſon of thoſe dangers that follow the Section in the ſound part, to wit, an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate profuſion of the blood, and an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary great pain, and the faintings and ſwoundings that depend upon theſe. And therefore that theſe may be avoided, they adviſe us to make the Section in the corrupted part alone. <hi>Fallopius</hi> indeed with a Razor cutteth into the dead fleſh (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the bone) a fingers breadth diſtant from the ſound part; and then after this he forthwith taketh away the bone with the ſaw; and then again with Irons red hot he burneth the greater Veſſels, and the fleſh, even unto the cauſing of pain. <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius</hi> alſo leaveth a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſound fleſh (as much as one fingers breadth) and appointeth the Section likewiſe to be made with a Razor in the dead fleſh; and he afterwards burneth the part with fire-hot Irons (after the ſame manner) to hinder and reſtrain the Hemorrhage, and to waſte and conſume the reliques of the putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>But here in this place we are to advertiſe you, that ſomtimes the putridneſs wil yet creep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and infect the neer neighboring parts; but then again, that ſomtimes the putridneſs ceaſeth, neither doth it creep any further unto the parts neer adjoyning; which whenſoever it happeneth, then round about the corrupted part there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a Circle that is exactly red, and of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe. In the latter caſe indeed, that way of curing ſeemeth not altogether improper and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, in a part that is corrupted and dead. For by this means thoſe many dangers which accompany that Section that is made in that part that is alive, are prevented; to wit, the profuſion of blood, pain, and faintings; ſince that through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted part the blood cannot paſs; and becauſe that the ſaid part hath no ſenſe at al. But if there be any of the dead fleſh left remaining, this, when the putridneſs ſhal ceaſe any longer to creep (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there ſhal not be any Cauteries admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred) wil afterwards divide it ſelf of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; and then it wil be ſeparated by Nature, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the adminiſtring of fit and proper Medicaments. But if as yet the putridneſs be creeping forward, and that Nature hath not as yet of her own accord begun to ſeparate the ſound from the corrupt, then the Section cannot be inſtituted in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted part alone, without preſent danger. For it oftentimes falleth out, that in the interior parts, and in the bottom of a Member, the corruption pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrateth far deeper and further than in the skin it appeareth to do. For the Muſcles and their Veſſels in the interior parts (in regard that they are there hotter than they are without) do eaſily receive the putridneſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any wil yet be inſtituting the inciſion in the mortified part, ſeeing that he leaveth behind much putridneſs in the interior parts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he wil haſten ſudden death upon the ſick perſon (by leaving the ſaid putridneſs that wil be alwaies creeping further, deeper, and broader) or elſe by reiterating and renewing of the Section he muſt needleſly and unadviſedly again exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and torture the Patient. Neither maketh it any thing at al to the matter that the pain is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the ſound part. For as <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith in the place before alleadged, it is little or nothing material, whether that guard and defence be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſtrong and ſafe, that is but one alone. And as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath it, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto extream Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes the Remedies that are to be adminiſtred muſt likewiſe be extream.</hi> But in very truth, the pain may in a manner be moderated, and the ſenſe obſcured by the faſtening on of the Ligatures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting the paſſage of the Animal Spirits for a certain time, as we ſhal afterward ſhew you; and likewiſe how with a very ſharp Razor the Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhal be almoſt quite finiſhed, before ever the ſick Perſon ſhal perceive what it is in doing. But yet they themſelves who make the Section in the the Corrupted part cannot (notwithſtanding) hereby prevent all manner of pain. For ſo ſoon as the bone is cut aſunder with the Saw, then there happen very ſharp and moſt acute pains, becauſe of the <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> or that Membrane that encompaſſeth the bones; which pain if any would avoid, then of neceſſity he muſt make the Inciſion with the Saw in that part wherein the ſaid Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane it ſelf is dead: which if he ſhould do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt even there likewiſe the bone it ſelf is corrupted, and there would be ſo great a putrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs left remaining in the Veſſels, and in the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (which are very apt &amp; ready to receive the ſaid putridneſs) that it cannot poſſibly be afterwards all of it extinguiſhed, no not with the Cautery it ſelf. Neither do thoſe Cauteries themſelves take away all that is corrupt without much pain; of which there ought indeed many to be applied and adminiſtred, if all the dead fleſh that there remaineth be to be taken away. And moreover, Cauteries have likewiſe in them theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, that by their vehement beat they melt the fat and the humors; and they ſo vehemently heat the parts, that thereupon in thoſe parts that have their ſenſe and feeling there is an extraordinary pain excited; and the fleſh for the moſt part is ſo
<pb n="2593" facs="tcp:49110:108"/> conſumed by the force of the Fire, and withall contracted, and wrinkled, that a great part of the bone ſticks forth naked and bare, which very often requireth a new Section. The Hemorrhage like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is not ſo greatly to be feared. For if the Veſſels be intercepted by Ligatures (as we ſhall ſhew you) there wil not then flow forth much of the blood. And if the blood ſhould chance to flow forth in ſomwhat a greater abundance then ordinary, yet this would make rather for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the ſick Perſon, then be any waies preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial and hurtful unto him. For by this means the blood in the Veſſels that haply hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome putridneſs, is evacuated; and ſo by this means al the danger is taken away and prevented, leſt that the putridneſs ſhould creep any broader, and by ſpreading it ſelf any further ſhould again prevail and get ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>That we may therefore briefly declare unto you after what manner the ſaid Section ought to be performed, Univerſals (if the malady wil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any reſpite and delay) are not to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and eſpecially there is a due regard to be had to the ſtrength of the Patient. Let the ſick Perſon therefore firſt of all eat a porcht Egg with a piece of Bread toaſted, and throughly ſoaked in Wine; and let him be ſtrengthened with Perfumes, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems, and other Cordial medicaments. Some there are that before they ſet upon the Section do preſcribe ſome kind of Narcotick Medicament, to dull and ſtupefie the Senſe: but <hi>Fallopius</hi> much blameth theſe; for (as he ſaith) gentle and ſleight ſtupefiers benefit little or nothing; and as for thoſe that are ſtrong, they are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. After this, the ſick Perſon being fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By which binding, firſt of all the overgreat flux of blood is prevented; ſecondly, the ſenſe of the part (by the ſhutting up of the Animal Spirits) is ſomwhat dulled; and thirdly, the Muſcles that are by this means drawn upwards (the Section being ended, and the bands looſned) do again devolve and move downward, that they may cover the extream and naked parts of the bones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The place of Amputation</note>As concerning the place of Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; in the Fingers, and Toes, the Section is moſt fitly made in the very Joynt. For in the Joynt (if at leaſt the Malady will admit thereof) the Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is made with the leaſt danger, and likewiſe with the leaſt pain. For the Nerves and the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons ſo ſoon as they are cut aſſunder they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly contracted upwards, and covered with fleſh, neither doth there follow any Convulſion hereupon. But if in the Feet the Sphacelus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the Ankle, then the Leg is to be cut off a little below the Knee; ſo that the Patient may be the better fitted and accommodated with a woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Leg. For which cauſe (in the Leg) the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is not alwaies to be made in that part that is neereſt unto the dead part, but there is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes alſo much of the ſound part to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putated. For if much of the Leg be left, this wil be very burdenſome unto the ſick Perſon, and a great impediment to him in his motion. But then on the Contrary, in the Arm, as little as may be of the ſound part is to be amputated; but the Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be inſtituted as neer as may be unto the corrupted part.</p>
                     <p>And therefore when we have made choyce of the moſt convenient place, then with a very ſharp Razor the Section is to be made even unto the very Bone; and if it may be done, the very <hi>Perioſtium</hi> is likewiſe to be cut in ſunder; and if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmal portion of the fleſh left behind, or if there be any of the fleſh hid betwixt two Bones (leſt it ſhould afterwards hinder that Section that is made with the Saw) that fleſh is likewiſe to be cut off with a Knife that is fit for the purpoſe. And then inſtantly, and with as much ſpeed as poſſibly may be, the Bone is to be amputated with the Saw, unleſs the Section be in the Joynt; for then the Member may be amputated with the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor alone. The amputation of the Member being finiſhed, the next thing to be done is the ſtopping of the flux of blood, after that it hath flown forth ſufficiently.

But <hi>Paraeus</hi> much diſliketh this courſe; for he conceiveth it indeed to be very cruel and barbarous, in regard that it cauſeth an extraordinary great pain, if the Section be made (as it ought to be) in the quick and live fleſh; and very bad and dangerous Symptoms happen unto the Nervous parts: unto which we may add that by the ſaid burning very much of the ſound fleſh is conſumed, whereupon the bones are left bare, and the fleſh, together with the Cicatrice, either it is not at all brought over the naked part; or if it be, it is not without much difficulty. And therefore he Practiſeth another way of ſtanching the Hemorrhage; to wit, with a Crows-bil he lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hold upon the Veſſels, and draweth them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; then bindeth them as cloſe as may be. The Veſſels being thus ſtraitly tied together with a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature; or (if you judg this more) fit ſhut up cloſe with a Cautery; the bonds are then to be looſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the courſer part of Flax or Hemp (we cal it Hurds) after it hath been throughly ſoaked in the White of an Egg, and ſufficiently beſprinkled with a Pouder that hath in it a virtue and faculty of ſtanching the blood, is to be laid upon the Member. And yet nevertheleleſs for the moſt part, without any ſuch Ligature or Cautery, the blood may likewiſe be ſtopped and ſtanched after this manner; As,</p>

                     <p>And this is the firſt dreſſing, or the firſt binding up; which is not to be looſened (in the Summer time) before the ſecond or third day; but in the Winter, not before the fourth day at the ſooneſt, unleſs in caſe of urgent neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>And in the mean time the Member is to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a direct middle poſture or figure, in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſtuffed with the hairs of Harts, or Wheaten meal. The firſt binding being looſened, and the firſt Proviſion taken away, again with the White of an Egg, as before, the Pouder ſtanching the blood is to be applied; and the excremities of the bones to be covered with a piece of the dry Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in the end the Wound to be bound up with ſome kind of Digeſtive.</p>
                     <p>And this Cure is ſo long to be continued, until there be now no cauſe of further fear that any miſchief may follow upon the Hemorrhage, and that the Wound be now become Purulent. For then theſe Medicaments being laid aſide, we are to make uſe of Cleanſers. <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius</hi> commendeth tins Unguent following of the Juyce of Smallage, not only for the Gangrene, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for other ſordid, foul, and Malignant Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Juyce of Smallage, of Water-Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, of Waybred or Plantane, and of Rue, of each two ounces; Honey of Roſes ſtrained one pound; boyl them to the Conſiſtence of a Syrup: and afterwards mingle therewith the meal of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, the Pouder of round Ariſtolochy root, of Angelica root, of Swallow-wort, and of Treacle, of each half an ounce, Aqua vitae one ounce; make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time we muſt do our endeavor that the Lips of the Wound may be drawn together, and afterwards that fleſh may cover the bones, and nay be unto them in ſtead of the Pillows. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> and others ſaw together the lips of the wound in the form of the letter X: but a Suture (which they cal the dry Suture) ſeemeth to be far more convenient; or elſe by a Glew, which is done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner. A Linen Cloth of a convenient figure and bigneſs, moiſtened throughly in a Glew of Aſtringent, Emplaſtick, and viſcous Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (ſuch as are Bolearmenick, Dragons blood, Gum Tragacanth, Sarcocol, Maſtick, the White of an Egg, and the like) is to be laid upon the place. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Maſtick, Dragons blood, Bolearmenick, Sarcocol, and the fineſt Volatile flour, of each half an ounce; Roſin of the Pine Tree two drams; mingle them with the White of an Egg. Of this Linen Cloth let there be made Emplaſters which are to be applied unto the extremity of the Wound on both ſides.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the Emplaſters are become dry, ſo that they begin to ſtick too faſt unto the Skin, then we uſe to annex unto them little handles to hold by, of Thread twice or thrice doubled; and with them we contract the lips; and this may likewiſe be done in a ſuture that is more thin ſewed.</p>
                     <p>And then at length we muſt do to the utmoſt of our endeavor, that the excremities of the bones which were hurt by the touch of the Iron and the Air may fal off. For which end, ſome there be that burn the utmoſt parts of them with a red hot Iron; yet ſtil taking great heed leſt that the fleſh, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſenſible parts be hurt thereby. Others make uſe of the Emplaſter of Becony, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catagmatick or Fracture Medicaments. And ſo within thirty or fourty daies whatſoever there is of the bone corrupted wil fall off. If the fleſh be luxuriant or proud (as we ſometimes term it) it is then to be repreſſed and kept under by the Pouder of Alum, and the like, and at length the Cicatrice is to be brought over it. But whereas pains do in the mean time much infeſt and diſquiet the ſick Perſon, and that there is cauſe to fear leſt that Convulſions ariſe thereupon; the Trunk or Stump of the part that hath been cut aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, yea and the Neck likewiſe, and all the Spinal Marrow is to be anoynted with thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments (that are otherwiſe alſo wont to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto affects of a Nervous Nature) made of Sage, Roſemary, Marjoram, Rue, Lavender, Dil, Camomile, St. Johns wort, Bayberries, the Oyl of Earth-worms, the Oyl of a Fox, Turpentine, and the like.</p>

<pb n="2595" facs="tcp:49110:109"/> uſually beginneth about the extream part of the Foot, with black and purple ſpots; and a little after this there appeareth from hence a cruſty and Gangrenous Ulcer, dry, and yielding forth neither the thin Excrement <hi>Sanies,</hi> nor yet the thicker, which we term <hi>Pus;</hi> and then one or other of the Toes beginneth to die, and then there appear red lines, and purple ſpots upon the juncture of the Foot, according to the length of the Leg. I have my ſelf ſeen ſome examples of this Diſeaſe. But both this Gangrene and Sphacelus differ from that Gangrene and Sphacelus that are both of them wel and commonly known, and that in many things. For that Gangrene that is ſo wel and commonly known hath its original for the moſt part from Cauſes that are manifeſt and apparent; and there alwaies floweth forth of the Member that is dead in ſuch a like Sphacelus a ſtinking and wateriſh humor; the Member becometh ſoft and putrid, and it ſendeth forth from it a grievous and noyſom ſtench, like unto that of a dead Carkaſs; and it creepeth much in a very ſhort time, and moſt commonly it ſoon deſtroyes and kils the man that hath it. But now the Scorbutick Gangrene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ever appeareth and invadeth the perſon without any manifeſt cauſe, creepeth forward but very gently and ſlowly, and doth not deſtroy the perſon therewith affected until after a long time: for I knew a Noble-man that lived above three months, but a certain School-Maſter I ſaw that lived above ſix months notwithſtanding this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady. The part affected with this Gangrene is altogether dry, ſo that there floweth out of it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at al; and when the corrupt part is taken away by the Iron, although a red fleſh offer it ſelf unto the view, yet nevertheleſs that ſame red color is withal ſomwhat dark and blackiſh; and the day following it likewiſe is even found to be dead alſo; and there is here no ſtink at al percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that offendeth. And moreover, ſo ſoon as ever the Malady hath firſt of al ſeized upon one of the feet only, then preſently after (without any manifeſt cauſe at al) there begin to appear in the other Leg and Foot alſo certain ſpots and blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of a red or purple color; and then likewiſe not long after this, one or other of the Toes of that Foot becometh wan and leaden colored, and in a very ſhort time it is found to be quite dead: and at length moſt commonly the party (as it befel that Noble perſon before mentioned) being taken either with the Apoplexy, or with the Epilepſie, upon the firſt approach thereof dieth.</p>
                     <p>And yet notwithſtanding, this Malady ſomtimes invadeth ſuddenly; to wit, when the peccant humors are by wrath, terror, or the like Cauſe, firſt diſturbed, and then afterwards thruſt down ſuddenly (and as it were in a moment) unto the Toes; and firſt of al to ſome one of them only; after the very ſame manner as the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> or <hi>Roſa</hi> is wont ſuddenly to ariſe: and this humor (in regard that it hath in it a very bad and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive quality, or elſe hath received it from ſome affect of the mind) cauſeth that part that it ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth upon inſtantly to die: and hence it is that by ſome this kind of Gangrene and Sphacelus is in ſpecial called <hi>Syderatio;</hi> whereas otherwiſe the Gangrene is wont in the general alſo to be termed <hi>Syderatio.</hi> Now this ſaid humor ſeizeth upon the Tendons moſt uſually; from whence there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe moſt terrible and intolerable pains that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and grieve the ſick perſon both day and night; which ſaid Tendons, in regard that they do not ſo eaſily and ſoon putrefie as doth the fleſh; hence it is that this Gangrene likewiſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth on ſo ſlowly, that ſomtimes (unto the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal view) it is a whol months ſpace in overſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one only joynt, and ere it ſeize upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, albeit that within almoſt al the Tendous of the Foot are already infected: and this Malady continueth ſomtimes a quarter of a year before it kil the perſon, and it is ſeldom or never cured, in regard that this depraved humor hath inſinuated it ſelf more deep than uſually into the Tendons, and therefore cannot be ſo eaſily taken away. So a certain Noble perſon (that had otherwiſe a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymical and foul body, and was ſubject unto the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi>) upon a fear and terror (Nature then ſuddenly thruſting down the vitious humors unto the little Toe) was ſurpriſed with a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, which afterwards by little and little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread likewiſe al the reſt of the Toes, and almoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> died.</p>
                     <p>Of this kind was that Gangrene alſo, with which a certain Citizen here (about thirty yeers of age) was taken in the month of <hi>January,</hi> 1633. He firſt of al complained of a pain in his left Arm, neer unto the Elbow; which he making light of, the pain deſcended unto his Hand; and it was preſently taken with a cold Tumor or Swelling, and at length became ſuddenly overſpread with a purple color; ſo that now there appeared mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſigns and tokens of mortification, and a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene. Yet notwithſtanding, upon the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of fit and proper Medicaments (of which we ſhal ſpeak more hereafter) his Hand had its natural color again reſtored unto it, and the ſwelling vaniſhed away; ſo that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further to be ſeen, but only in the very tip of the little Finger the Scarf-skin appeared to be ſomwhat wrinkled; upon the opening of which here flowed forth a little of an humor; and the Skin underneath appeared pale, and ſo the very tip of the finger was taken with a Gangrene; which yet nevertheleſs (without any diminution of the Joynt) was cured. In the curing whereof we found this one thing wel worth our obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that from the ſaid finger moſt ſharp and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite pains were extended into the whol Hand, inſomuch that the ſick perſon was even afraid to betake himſelf unto his bed; but that reſt and
<pb n="2596" facs="tcp:49110:110"/> ſleep he took was in the night time as he ſate. When his finger likewiſe was handled by the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, the pains that he felt were ſo great, that he could not endure the leaſt touch; the feet moreover ſwelled much, and his face was ſomthing more ſwoln than uſually.</p>
                     <p>Neither indeed wil any man that is not a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger unto what is done in the practice of Phyſick admire that ſome vitious and depraved humor by Nature her ſelf thruſt unto ſome Member ſhould be able ſuddenly to mortifie and deaden it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that a potential Cautery of Lye (out of which Sope is made) doth within the ſpace of an hour, or at the utmoſt in two hours time, mortifie that part upon which it is impoſed; whenas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is made only out of the Salt of Woods, and of unſlaked Lime. What wonder is it therefore, that ſome humor of the ſame Nature, ſalt, ſharp, and malignant, being now ſeparated, &amp; acting a part by it ſelf from the reſt, by the which it was tempered and qualified (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tels us in his Book of the Ancient Phyſick) ſhould effect ſomewhat like unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                     <p>Of all thoſe that have been affected with the Scorbutick Gangrene (of whom I made mention before) no one ever recovered, beſides that Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, that was taken with a Gangrene in the little Finger of his left Hand; he himſelf being (as I ſaw good cauſe to judg of him) a Scorbutick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

And firſt of al, among theſe blemiſhes we wil ſpeak ſomthing of that affect which they cal <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> that is to ſay, heat-wheals, or ſmal hard puſhes in the face. Where notwithſtanding we muſt give you to underſtand (as a little before we told you likewiſe) that many of the Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Spots, and Blemiſhes of this kind, although they are now with us commonly and generally wel known; yet nevertheleſs by what names theſe like Affects were called by the Ancients is not ſo wel and ſufficiently known. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth even out of <hi>Celſus,</hi> who in his ſixth Book, and Chap. 5. thus writeth: <hi>The regarding of theſe</hi> Vari <hi>or Pimples,</hi> Lenticulae <hi>or Freckles, and</hi> Ephelides, <hi>ſo as to cure them, is but a meer folly and foppery</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but yet nevertheleſs it is likewiſe a thing altogether impoſſible to take from Women the care they have of the beauty and handſomneſs of their faces. Now then, of thoſe that we mentioned before, the</hi> Vari <hi>and</hi> Lenticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae <hi>are commonly known; although that ſpecies be ſomwhat more rare which the Greeks cal Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos, ſince that kind is a</hi> Lenticula <hi>ſomwhat more red, and more unequal. But at for the</hi> Ephelis, <hi>the moſt are generally ignorant, as not wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it is; it being indeed nothing elſe but a certain roughneſs, and an hardneſs of an ill color. The reſt of them are to be found no where in the body, but only in the face; but the</hi> Lenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae <hi>are wont likewiſe to ariſe and appear in ſome other part.</hi> And I am altogether of opinion, that even our very ordinary Women are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently acquainted with theſe Affects; which ſaid Affects notwithſtanding, viz. <hi>Vari, Lenticulae,</hi> and <hi>Ephelides,</hi> what Affects they were with the Ancients is not ſufficiently manifeſt. If the <hi>Ephelis</hi> that <hi>Galen</hi> mentioneth in his ſeventh Book of the faculty of ſimple Medicaments be written by the Greek Letter 'η, then without all doubt it hath its name from the Sun, ſo that they are certain ſpots contracted from the Sun. But <hi>Celſus</hi> (unleſs it be an error and miſtake of the book) writeth the word with the Greek ς, <hi>Ephelis,</hi> and ſaith that it is a roughneſs and hardneſs of an evil color; which wel agreeth not with thoſe ſpots. <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi> (in his ſecond Tract, ſecond Book, and Chap. 4. of the Affects of the external parts) ſaith that the Greeks <hi>Ephelis</hi> is <hi>Panus;</hi> and that <hi>Panus</hi> indeed may infect any part what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="2599" facs="tcp:49110:111"/> of the body, eſpecially the Groyns, the Abdomen, the Back, the Neck, and the middle Region of the Breaſt: but for the moſt part ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs (as he writeth) it defileth the very Forehead it ſelf. But in regard that <hi>Celſus</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up the <hi>Ephelis</hi> among thoſe Affects that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appear but in the Face, we have therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined above (in the firſt Part, and 29. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that thoſe broad ſpots that appear about the Groyns, Breaſt, Abdomen, Back, and Neck, and dye the ſaid parts with a certain kind of duskiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is one while ſomwhat greeniſh, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while ſomthing reddiſh, and as ſoon again of a color inclining to black (and which are generally wel known) are more fitly to be referred unto the <hi>Alphus Niger</hi> or the black <hi>Alphus.</hi> And he (the aforeſaid <hi>Rudius</hi>) doth likewiſe ill in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Ephelis</hi> by the name of <hi>Panus;</hi> and his determining that <hi>Ephelis</hi> and <hi>Panus</hi> are one and the ſame Affect, is altogether falſe: ſince that out of <hi>Celſus</hi> his fifth Book, Chap. 18. <hi>Pliny</hi> his twenty four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(in <hi>Foeſius</hi> his Book) writeth that this kind of ſpots is called <hi>Ephelis;</hi> when he ſaith, That <hi>thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are with child if they have a ſpot in their Face, as it were from the Suns burning, for the moſt part bear female Children.</hi> Where for the moſt part is wel added, in regard that it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerved alſo that Women great with Child, which have born Males, have had their Faces defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with theſe k nd of ſpots; ſo that theſe ſpots may rather be ſaid to be a ſign and token of the Conception in general, than particularly of the Sex that is conceived, whether it be Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male: Whence it is, that the Germans likewiſe cal it <hi>Kinds flecken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now, whereas there is a twofold <hi>Ephelis,</hi> one from cauſes external, another from internal Cauſes; of the latter of theſe we intend to treat in the Chapter following, but of the former we wil ſpeak in this preſent Chapter. And indeed the firſt kind of theſe <hi>Ephelides</hi> is that wel known Affect,<note place="margin">Blackneſs from the Sun.</note> to wit, that blackneſs (which the Germans cal <hi>Sommerbradt</hi>) in the Face, the Hands, and thoſe other parts that are expoſed unto the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, contracted from the heat of the Sun. And as wel men as women are ſubject unto this affect; but yet nevertheleſs more eſpecially women, as having their Skin more tender, and chiefly in the Spring time. For whereas in the Winter the Face was not accuſtomed to much heat, if in the Spring it be ſuddenly expoſed unto the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, the Skin that before was white now begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to wax red with a certain kind of blackneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Affect is of it ſelf known from the Cauſe foregoing. And the Face is not only deformed with ſome certain ſpots, but the whol color there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is changed.</p>
                     <p>But now this burning and blackneſs from the Sun may be prevented,<note place="margin">Preſervation from it.</note> if the Suns Beams be turned away from the Face by Shades and other Coverings, and the Hands kept covered with Gloves; or both the Face and Hands anointed with the white o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>And of theſe kind of Medicaments there is need moſt eſpecially in the Spring time, when the tender Face can very hardly be ſufficiently guarded from the heat of the Sun, and of the Air.</p>

                        <p>But if the Face be already as it were burnt, and a blackneſs be contracted, Nature indeed of her own accord is wont in proceſs of time to change this deformity (when it draweth a new Scarf-skin upon the burnt place) if in the mean time the Face be covered from the Beams of the Sun. But theſe delaies being for the moſt part tedious unto women, they muſt in al haſte have their priſtine color again reſtored unto them by the help of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments. And commonly women are wont to cleanſe their Faces with the Leaves of the Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tree while they are yet freſh and green. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them there are that uſe Roſe-water wherein Camphyre hath been diſſolved; and others of them make uſe likewiſe of the Cherry-tree Gum diſſolved in Vinegar, whereunto they put a little Oat-meal.</p>

                     <p>ANd hither belong likewiſe the <hi>Lentigines,</hi> which the Germans (from the color of dry Leaves) cal <hi>Sommer ſtroſſen, Sommer flecken,</hi> and <hi>Lauf flecken;</hi> and they are ſpots in color reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Lentiles, with the which (in Women eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) the Face principally, and ſomtimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Hands, Arms, and upper part of the Thorax being expoſed unto the Air is aſperſed and overſpread, they ſomtimes ſtanding thicker, and ſomtimes thinner, like unto ſo many drops, as it were, without any pain and trouble; in ſome appearing indeed only in the Summer time, and vaniſhing again in the Winter; and in ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they keep their courſe from yeer to yeer.</p>
                     <div type="causes">
                        <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                        <p>But now they have their original from aduſt burnt blood ſeizing upon the Scarf-skin. And this happeneth more eſpecially in ruddy bodies, that are of a Cholerick temperature, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Summer time when that vapor of the blood is more burnt. And hence it is that in the Winter for the moſt part theſe ſpots vaniſh, but then they return again and appear in the Summer. And they break forth chiefly in thoſe parts that are expoſed unto the external Ambient Air, the Face, the Neck, the Hands, and the ſuperior part of the Thorax, becauſe that the Scarf-skin is more burnt by the Sun, and the Ambient Air de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth thoſe burnt vapors in the Skin. <hi>Platerus</hi> is of opinion, that the Juyce that ſhould nouriſh the hairs that are fixed in the Skin, being brought unto the pores of the Skin do cauſe theſe ſpots. For this humor (ſaith he) being firſt of al aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by them, and agreeing ſomwhat with them in color before they are put unto the Roots of them, if it be by them further diſperſed any whither elſe into the ſuperficies and circumference of the pores, it then produceth thoſe kind of ſpots, and that dark and duskiſh color, ſomwhat (more or leſs) inclining unto that color of the hairs that it had
<pb n="2601" facs="tcp:49110:112"/> gotten while it was aſſimilated by them. Which diffuſion of this Juyce into the Pores proceedeth ſomtimes from the external heat overſtrongly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it, and withall dilating the Pores, if then the Juyce nouriſhing the Hairs doth not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix it ſelf unto the roots of the Hairs, but diffuſing it ſelf further alſo, and there ſubſiſting, cauſeth thoſe Dusk, Dark, and Brown ſpots, more or leſs, according to the diverſity of the colour of the Skin. But ſince that the Face wanteth Hairs, it is not credible that the Juyce ordained by Nature for the nouriſhing of the Hair ſhould breed ſuch kind of ſpots: but for the breeding of theſe like ſpots there ſufficeth a portion of the aduſt blood, degenerating as it were into a Melancholly humor. <hi>Platerus</hi> alſo is of opinion that the overgreat Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural looſneſs of the Pores contributeth its furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſo that even by reaſon of them the ſaid Juyce doth not only nouriſh the Hairs, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe produce theſe ſpots. But I had here rather aſſent with <hi>Euſtachius Rudius,</hi> who thinketh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the <hi>Lentigines</hi> do ariſe from the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Skin, and therefore becauſe that the Cheeks are more thin than other parts, therefore it is that although there come into them very many of theſe aduſt vapors, yet notwithſtanding they are not detained in them, but are from thence gently evaporated; and ſo the <hi>Lentigines</hi> that are in them are but few: but becauſe the Skin of the Fore-head is thicker, and that the vapors are not eaſily received in it, but being once received are the more detained there, therefore the Fore-heed doth the more abound with theſe <hi>Lentigines</hi> or Dusky ſpots.</p>

                        <p>Theſe <hi>Lentigines</hi> are eaſily known; becauſe that they are Spots of the bigneſs a of Lentile, of a dark, brown, and dusky color, diſperſed up and down in many drops as it were, ſtanding cloſe and thick together, and very familiar unto ſuch as are of a red Hair; and they annoy the Face, the Neck, the Hands, and thoſe parts that are expoſed unto the Sun and the Air.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of Coſmetical, or Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Medicaments.</head>
                     <p>BUt yet although we have hitherto in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapters ſpoken touching the taking away of divers of theſe Skin-ſpots; Women not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (that ſtudy little elſe but their beauty) are not herewith contented; but they
<pb n="2602" facs="tcp:49110:113"/> reſtleſsly purſue after thoſe things that procure unto their Faces a luſtre and amiableneſs. For their ſakes therefore we wil add ſomthing alſo even of theſe Coſmetick or beautifying Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now theſe Medicaments are of two ſorts; ſome of them do only mend the obſolete, dark, and blackiſh colour of the Face, and render the Skin ſomewhat more bright and cleer; (and theſe are by no means to be diſallowed of; ſince that they only reſtore unto Man or Woman that beauty which either by the injury of the Air, or by any other Cauſe, they have loſt and been deprived of; and withall do truly and really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a fair and ſtable colour; and theſe are called Coſmetick or be beautifying Medicaments:) but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there are that are only Palliative, and theſe we call Face-ſucuſſes, becauſe that unto the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural colour there is likewiſe added an adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and acquired white or red colour; and this is ſo painted on that continueth if for a while, and but for a while only, and deceiveth the Eyes of the Beholders. We ſhal ſpeak of the former ſort of Medicaments alone. But as for the latter ſort of theſe Medicaments, in regard that we judge it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honeſt nor pious to make uſe of them, we wil therefore ſay nothing at all of them, but paſs them over in ſilence. But now as for what concerneth the former of theſe Medicaments, it ſeemeth alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a thing unreaſonable to reject them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they bring over the Face no <hi>Fucus,</hi> or counterfeit painted beauty, but they only reſtore the Natural whiteneſs of the body, loſt upon any Cauſe whatſoever. And this is more eſpecially allowed unto Women; who becauſe that they are in Wiſdom, ſtrength of Body, Fortitude, and in ſome certain other things, much inferior unto Men, therefore in ſtead (of theſe as the Poet <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creon</hi> tels us)
<q>
                           <l>Nature on Women doth beſtow</l>
                           <l>A Comely form, and Beauteous hiew:</l>
                           <l>Inſtead of Lances, Targets, Shields,</l>
                           <l>Their Face a fair bright luſtre yields:</l>
                           <l>Which puts on Women ſuch a Grace,</l>
                           <l>That Fire and Sword to them give place.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Plato</hi> (in his Phaedrus) ſaith, <hi>That of all things whatſoever Beauty is the moſt excellent and Amiable,</hi> and there he calleth a Beautifull Face, a <hi>Divine Face,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>a Face ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forth by reaſon of a kind form that is put upon it.</hi> But the other is altogether to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Women; and Sr. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writeth very truly, in theſe words of his (in his ſecond Tract, of the Habit of Virgins) <hi>We ought not only</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to admoniſh Virgins, or Widows; but I conceive, that even Married Women and all others whatſoever (in general) are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, that the Handiwork and Image of God ought by no means to be adulterated, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto any yellow color, or any black Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or any kind of redneſs, or (in a word) any other Medicine that corrupteth the Native Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments.</hi> And a little after; <hi>They lay wicked hands</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>upon the Work of God, when as they go about to transfigure and reform that which he himſelf hath formed, as not knowing that all whatſoever is made and wrought is the work of God, but whatſoever is Changed is the work of the Devil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Medicaments of the former ſort are ſuch as (almoſt all of them) do very much ſcout and cleanſe, by ſeparating from the Skin that Juyce that deformeth the ſame with this brown and duskiſh color, and by alluring thereto a new Juyce that may procure unto it a bright and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful color. Unto which there are ſomtimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded likewiſe certain Emollients, which have in them a power to ſoften the Skin when it is hard, thick, and rough; they alſo make it ſmoother, and more eſpecially they cauſe an extraordinary ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Hands.</p>
                     <p>Milk wil ſatisfie both theſe ſcopes, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Aſſes Milk, and Goats Milk: Which <hi>Poppaea</hi> the Wife of the Emperor <hi>Nero</hi> being not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of (a Woman extreamly proud and luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) ſhe cauſe a five hundred Milch Aſſes alwaies to attend her whitherſoever ſhe went; and in a great Tub made purpoſely for her to bathe in, ſhe waſhed her whole body in the ſaid Milk, that ſo it might be all over freed from wrinkles, made tender and delicate, and preſerved white; as <hi>Pliny</hi> relateth the ſtory in his eleventh Book, Chap. 41. and Book 28. Chap. 12.</p>
                     <p>Cleanſers are theſe; <hi>the Roots of the greater Dragon-wort, Solomons Seal, great Figwort, wild Cucumber, white Lilies, the Elder, bitter Almonds, Pines, the four greater cold Seeds, French or Kidney Beans, Rice, Bean meal, the Meal of Cicers, of Lupines, Starch, the White of an Egg, Milk, Camphyre, Salt, Oyl of Tartar, Frankincenſe, Myrrh, the Crumbs of white Bread, the Oyly Nut Ben.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the Roots of Dragon-wort there is a certain Gerſa made; which is nothing elſe but the Dregs or Lees thereof, as they commonly cal them.</p>
                     <p>And ſo alſo there may in the like manner be prepared ſuch a like <hi>Faecula</hi> or <hi>Gerſa,</hi> out of the Roots of Solomons Seal, and great Figwort. And out of the Oyly Nut Ben (commonly called Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus Myrepſica) there is an Oyl preſſed forth, that is called the Oyl of Been.</p>
                     <p>And likewiſe out of divers of theſe ſimples toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that erewhile we mentioned there are made many deſtilled Waters, and divers Compoſitions. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Root of Solomons Seal, Dragon-wort, great Figwort, of each one ounce and half; of the Flowerdeluce one ounce, of Bean flower two ounces, Maſtick one ounce, Borax two drams; let them be deſtilled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the ſoft Crumb of White Bread three

                     <p>Take <hi>Rice one pound, let it be ſteeped in the Water of Bean flowers, untill it break; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards add of choyce Maſtick ſix drams, Borax two drams; and then deſtil them.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Pith or Crumb of White Bread one pound, Root of Solomons Seal half a pound, Goats Milk as much as wil ſuffice; and let them be deſtilled.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Flowers of the Elder, and of Bean flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of each a like proportion; pour hereunto Goats Milk, and ſtrain it; let them ſtand in a cold place for eight daies; and then deſtill them.</hi> When you uſe the Water,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Beans hulled, beat them into a very fine Pouder, and caſt the ſame into the ſaid Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and after this let the Face be waſhed with this Water, and permitted to dry leiſurely of it ſelf. In the end diſſolve Camphyre in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, and mingle it with Eldern Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and let the Face be waſhed with this Water.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Whites of Eggs, in number twenty four; Cinamom two drams, Aſſes Milk or Goats milk, two Quarts, and deſtill them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Emulſions likewiſe made of the four greater Cold Seeds, bitter Almonds, and Pines, are here very uſeful.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo Decoctions made (with which the Face is to be waſhed) of Beans, Cicers, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, Rice. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roots of white Lilies, Solomons Seal, Borrage, of each one ounce, Mallows, Sope-wort, Parietary or Pellitory of the Wall, and Violets, of each two pugils; Beans hulled one handfull, Flowers of Mallows half a handful; make a Decoction, with which let the Face be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Liniments moreover and Unguents are made uſe of, among which are the <hi>Pomacea</hi> or <hi>Pomata,</hi> as they are commonly called. The Oyl of Talck is now adaies much in the mouths of many; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much uſed in the Nurſeries of great Women. But this laſt ſeemeth rather to belong unto the Face-fucuſſes then unto the true Coſmeticks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be adminiſtred only to cleanſe; and after the uſe thereof (when they go abroad in publick) waſhed off from the Face.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Medicaments that whiten the Hand.</note>But now the more Choice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Women (that are unaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to labor) do not only admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter certain Medicaments unto their Faces, but unto their Hands likewiſe, that ſo they may become ſoft and white; and theſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made of the Crumb of White Bread, the Meal of Barley, of Cicers, of Lupines, and Honey, all which being wel wrought together with Water, or elſe mingled with ſoft Sope and Honey, they waſh their Hands therewith.

                     </p>
                     <p>And here likewiſe the Pomatum Unguent is of much uſe.</p>
                     <p>Or elſe ſuch a Sope may be made;</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There are likewiſe many other Medicaments (which we mentioned a little above) for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Face fair and clear; and they are here alſo very uſeful.</p>

Which if yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we have a deſire that it may be ſpeedily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, it may then be done by ſome certain Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments; ſuch as are, firſt the Oyl of Myrrh, which is made if the Yelk be taken out of an Egg hard boyled, and then the Egg filled up with Myrrh, and put into a moiſt place, until it be all diſſolved into a Liquor; and this likewiſe may be wrought by the deſtilled Oyl of Myrrh. The moiſture alſo that ſweateth forth of Eggs whiles they are in roſting is very uſeful for this purpoſe. The Oyl likewiſe of the Yelks of Eggs, the Fat of the Thymallus Fiſh, which they commonly call <hi>Aſcia;</hi> the Oyl that is preſſed forth of the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of Peaches, Oyl of bitter Almonds, and Oyl of Been. Or elſe an Unguent may be made of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, Camphyre, and Mans fat, or of Litharge, and the Oyl of Roſes, and the Oyl of bitter Almonds
<pb n="2604" facs="tcp:49110:114"/> mingled with Honey; or elſe an Unguent may be made of the Juyce or Root of wild Cucumber and Honey; and with this the Cicatrice may be anointed for one day, but the day following with Milk; and this by turns from day to day muſt for a while be continued. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>the Mucilage of Fenugreek ſeed, and of Fleawort, of each two drams; Oyl of Tartar by ſtraining half an ounce; Oyl of Roſes one ounce; Ceruſs, and Borax, of each one dram, and mingle them.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>the Root of Dragon-wort, of Solomons Seal, of each two drams; Bitter Almonds, Peach Kernels, of each one dram; Egg-ſhels burnt half a dram; Frankincenſe and choyce Myrrh, of each one dram; Sugar Candy three drams; the Mucilage of Fenugreek ſeed one ounce; Oyl of the Yelks of Eggs, and Mans fat, of each as much as wil ſuffice: Mingle and make a Liniment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if the Cicatrice be deep, it is not ſo to be amended by Medicaments that it may be made equal and even with the reſt of the Skin; but the Cicatrice is by Section, or elſe by ſome corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Medicament to be taken away; and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity (as much as is requiſite) is to be filled up with fleſh, and afterwards a new Cicatrice is to be brought al over the part.</p>

                     <p>THere is alſo another ſort of Blemiſhes that is wont to defile and deform the Skin, and this is derived from the very firſt original, and that which the Infant hath contracted even in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb; and hereupon they are called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and original Blemiſhes, Spots, and Marks. Now theſe Spots are very various and different, ſomtimes of a red color, and as ſoon again of a dark and brown color, and oftentimes of neither of theſe two, but of ſome other color; and it is alſo of this or that ſhape and figure; and ſomtimes in this, ſomtimes in that part of the body.</p>
                     <div type="causes">
                        <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                        <p>There are ſome indeed that beleeve that theſe ſpots and blemiſhes are excited in the body from a fortuitous and accidental concourſe of the humors. But the very truth is that ſuch like things come not to paſs by chance; but Experience it ſelf tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us, that theſe ſpots depend upon the fancy and imagination of the Mother, and that by it the Infant is thus marked as they ſpeak. There is no neceſſity for our heaping up of the ſeveral Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities both of Philoſophers and Phyſitians, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this ſubject; neither is it requiſite here to recount even al the faults and things amiſs in the conformation, that are cauſed by occaſion of the imagination. For it is wel enough known unto al kind of Women, that Infants have now and then had ſome certain ſpots reſembling Straw-berries, or Cherries; or elſe red ſpots like unto red Wine, or the Fire; whenas upon the ſight of ſuch like objects by the Mother, the Imagination maketh an Impreſſion of theſe like colors upon the Child. And I my ſelf knew a woman great with Child, who ſtanding under a Mulberry Tree, there fel ſome of the Mulberries upon her back; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Infant that ſhe went withal had as many excreſcences in its back, reſembling the ſhape and figure of Mulberries. But now, how it cometh to paſs that the Imagination doth this, I have at large ſhewn you in my Tract touching the Conſent and Agreement of the Chymiſts with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> Chap. 14. and in the fourth Book of our Practice, Part 2. Sect. 4. Chap. 7. Which here to repeat I hold it altogether needleſs.</p>

                        <p>Women do commonly make uſe of the blood of the Secundine or Afterbirth for the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of theſe Spots; rubbing and cleanſing the ſaid Spots therewith while it is yet hot.

                        <p>There are yet not withſtanding other cleanſing Medicaments likewiſe (of the which we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therunto ſpoken, and preſcribed for the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of other Face-ſpots) that may here be made uſe of: others adminiſter the Mothers faſting, ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: and others require the often inſtilling of the Milk that is drawn out of the Mothers Breaſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſaid ſpots and deformities. Which if they ſuffice not, then we are to have recourſe unto cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding and Cauſtick Medicaments alſo, or unto the Manual operation, and the ſhaving of the Scarf-skin likewiſe. It is alſo good for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the morning (for ſome certain daies conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually) to chew Muſtard ſeed, and with it to rub the ſpot. And ſome there are that preſerve that part of the Infants Navel that falleth off after the due knitting thereof, and this being dried, and afterwards moiſtened in the Water of the Herb Chriſtopher they lay it upon the Spot thrice a day, ſo long until the ſaid ſpot be wholly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.

                     <p>THe German Practical Books (as we may ſee in the Practice of <hi>Gabelchomerus,</hi> and in the Phyſical Diſpenſatory of <hi>Wittichius,</hi> and in others) make mention (among Childrens Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) of a certain Affect that they cal <hi>Denflug,</hi> which in regard that I never ſaw it, I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omitted, &amp; not at al ſpoken of it in my Tract of Infants Diſeaſes. But becauſe there are ſome that write than they have ſeen it, we wil therefore make mention thereof here in this place. Now theſe deſcribe this Affect, that they are certain flitting ſpots, of a red or purple color, creeping up and down here and there in the Skin; which if they touch upon any orifice (as ſuppoſe, the Mouth, the Noſtrils, the Eyes, and the Ears) and penetrate ſo far as that they reach even unto them, the Malady is then mortal. And therefore that they may prevent this, they take Roſe-water, and mingle therewith a little Saffron, and with this they anoint al the ſaid Orifices (and the Spots themſelves likewiſe) round about. Only they do not anoint the body towards the Feet, that ſo by the Feet theſe ſpots may vaniſh. Which ſpots (if any ſuch there be) without al doubt they are a ſpecies of the <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> and therefore we are not only to adminiſter that Liniment unto the orifices of the body, but we are likewiſe to make uſe of thoſe Expulſive Medicaments alſo that are otherwiſe wont to be uſed in the <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi>

                     <p>AS I have often told you (and cannot but here again acquaint you with it) there are many kinds of Tubercles and Spots (and theſe are alſo at this day very commonly known every where in al Nations) which by what names they were called by the Greeks or Latines we know not; whenas yet notwithſtanding it is no way credible that there were no ſuch Affects as theſe among the Ancients; for there were then riſe in thoſe times the ſame cauſes as now.</p>
                     <p>There is commonly known an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which the Germans cal <hi>Leber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecke,</hi> without al doubt,<note place="margin">The Affect <hi>Leberflecke</hi> what it is.</note> in regard they beleeve that it hath its original from the Liver, to wit, dark and browniſh ſpots, or ſuch as of yellow become ſomwhat blackiſh, as broad as the Palm of the Hand, ſeizing upon the Groyns eſpecially, and the Breaſt, and the Back, yea and ſomtimes alſo covering the whol Breaſt with a certain ſleight roughneſs of the Skin that ſendeth forth as it were ſcales, or branny ſcurf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Conſultat. 11. but yet he gives them no name. And <hi>Platerus</hi> likewiſe ſeemeth to make mention of theſe, when he writeth, that there are ſome certain dark, browniſh, and dun ſpots, as broad as the palm of the hand, ariſing ſomtimes in ſome certain parts of the body, and at ſome certain times only, and vaniſhing alſo at ſome certain ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But he maketh the matter ſomwhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and doubtful, in bidding us to ſeek for the cauſe, and for the Cure in the <hi>Lentigo.</hi> For theſe <hi>Lentigines,</hi> and the ſpots we now ſpeak of are different Affects, and they have different Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; as wil further appear from thoſe things that have been already ſpoken of before in the third Chapter, touching the <hi>Lentigines,</hi> and ſhal be
<pb n="2606" facs="tcp:49110:115"/> more fully ſpoken of in this preſent Chapter. Whether theſe kind of ſpots may not be referred unto the <hi>Vitiligo,</hi> and the black <hi>Alphus</hi> (as I think that they wel may) I leave it unto the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reader. Our purpoſe is here in this Chapter to explain and treat of this Subject, without either the Greek or Latine name; for the German name is of al others the beſt known, as are alſo the very ſpots themſelves.</p>
                     <div type="causes">
                        <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                        <p>The Cauſe of theſe Spots is a humor very dry and Melancholy brought unto the Skin, together with the aliment of the parts; or alſe blood that is feculent, ful of dregs, and very thick; which when it cannot al of it be aſſimilated, that of it that is excrementitious is thruſt forth unto the Skin. But although that more feculent blood may be generated from an overdry Liver; (from whence it is that by the Germans it is called <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berflecke,</hi> that is to ſay, Liver-ſpots:) yet nevertheleſs, ſeeing that the Liver doth its office in its ſanguifying faculty, and breedeth good blood, the Spleen without doubt is not altogether free from fault. Whereupon I have obſerved that after thoſe ſpots (if they have continued long) Quartan Feavers have ariſen. An unfit kind of Diet, and ſuch a courſe of life as is apt to breed a thick and feculent blood, and a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humor, maketh very much likewiſe for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of theſe ſpots; touching which we have already ſpoken elſewhere.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="prognosis">
                        <head>Prognoſticks.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. Theſe very ſpots indeed have in themſelves little or no danger; neither do they breed any kind of trouble, or any deformity viſible unto the eye, when they ariſe in the Face and Hands, as the <hi>Lentigines,</hi> but in thoſe places that are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wich Clothes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And yet notwithſtanding, in regard of the Cauſe upon which they depend, and the vitious Conſtitution of the Liver, and Spleen, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage other Diſeaſes: and very frequently Tertian and Quartan Feavers follow theſe Spots.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Although thoſe Spots may eaſily be taken away (as anon we ſhal ſhew you) yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, unleſs the fault and imperfection of the blood and bowels (from which the vitious blood is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated) be taken away, they again return and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in a ſhort time after.</p>

                        <p>Since therefore theſe kind of Spots being taken away may again return, unleſs the Cauſe upon which they depend be likewiſe taken away, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humor is therefore to be evacuated by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that are made of the Roots of Polypody, Succory, Borrage, Spleenwort, Dodder, Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair, Egrimony, the Leaves of Sene, Rheubarb, Jalap. And this is ſomtimes to be repeated: and if there be occaſion, a Vein may likewiſe be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                        <p>But then in regard that theſe Purgers do evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate only thoſe humors that are collected in the Veins, but do not prevent the generation of the ſaid humors; we muſt therefore more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially do the utmoſt of our endeavor that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Conſtitution of the Liver and Spleen (upon which the breeding of theſe humors doth depend) may be amended: and this may be performed by a good and wholſom dyet, by the which that dry conſtitution of the Liver and Spleen may by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees be reſtored unto a better condition. And therfore we are to preſcribe Meats of a good Juyce, ſuch as Goats fleſh, Veal, Lamb, Pullets, Eggs, and the like, Barley, Wheat, Apples throughly ripe,, Prunes, Raiſins, Almonds. But the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt avoid meats that are thick, ſalt, &amp; ſharp, and generally al meats of an il juyce, ſuch as are fleſh that is ſmoke-dried, and the like. For the Conſtitution of the Bowels being by the uſe of good meats reduced unto a better eſtate and condition, the vitious humors wil no more be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, but only a good and temperate blood.</p>
                        <p>But as for what concerneth Topicks; it wil be very good in the morning to rub thoſe parts that are thus defiled and deformed with ſpots. But firſt of al, before the Patients going into the Bath, it wil not be amiſs to take the Water, or the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Fumitory, with a little Treacle. After his ſweat let the place be anointed with Muſtard ſeed with warm water reduced into the form of a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſs; which may be there left to continue ſo long, even until that a heat and a certain pricking be felt and perceived in the part; and afterward let it be waſhed with warm Water. Or elſe let it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with this Maſs.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>White Sope half a pound, let it be ſliced and dried; and afterwards add of Muſtard ſeed one dram and half; the meal of Beans and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, of each two ounces; the ſoft Crumb of white Bread one ounce; with the juyce of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory or the ſharp-pointed Dock, mingle, and uſe it.</hi>

                     <p>Now the Itch is a pain that is excited from a thin and ſharp excrement ſticking between the Scarf-skin and the Skin it ſelf. For albeit while the place of the Itch be ſcratched, there is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="2607" facs="tcp:49110:115"/> a certain ſeeming pleaſure; yet nevertheleſs this pleaſure doth not belong to the Nature of the Itch, but it followeth only upon the ſcratching, whilſt that the parts that were gnawn by a ſharp matter do ſuddenly return unto their natural ſtate, and their wonted ſmoothneſs. For like as there is a pain excited from that ſudden motion unto a preternatural ſtate; ſo in like manner there is a certain pleaſure felt from this ſudden motion and return unto their Natural ſtate. Now the truth is, the Itch it ſelf ceaſeth after ſcratching, becauſe that the matter which was the cauſe of the Itching is evacuated; and becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the ſolution of Continuity that exciteth the pain, is again brought unto an Union and quietneſs, if the ſcratching be any thing ſtrong.</p>

                        <p>The neereſt cauſe of the Itch is a ſalt Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is biting and ſharp; to wit, either meer pure Choler, or elſe black Choler, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Melancholy; or elſe a ſalt flegm. Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement albeit that it be preſent alſo in the ſcabby Affect, yet in the Itch it is more thin, and inſinuateth it ſelf through the leaſt particles. But it ſticks between the true skin and the ſcarf-skin, and thereupon by its acrimony it goadeth (as I may ſo ſay) and pricketh the ſenſible particles in the skin, and provoketh them unto ſcratching. And indeed like as the Nature of the excremens it ſelf maketh much for the ſticking of the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement in the Skin (this Excrement although it be thin, yet having in it a certain kind of clammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glewiſhneſs, by the which it ſticketh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cloſe and pertinaciouſly unto the parts;) ſo doth likewiſe the thickneſs of the skin it ſelf, by reaſon of which it cannot exhale.</p>
                        <p>But now that excrement is collected by reaſon of the heat and drineſs of the Liver, the uſe of ſharp meats, and many Spices. And hence it is that old men (thoſe eſpecially of them that in their youth had a hot Liver, and ſuch of them as then uſed a hot kind of Diet in their meat and drink) are in their old age ſo ſenſible of the Itch, and at length come to be troubled with ſcabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. See further hereof in <hi>Galen</hi> his ſecond Book of the Cauſes of Symptoms, and the ſixth Chapter.</p>

                        <p>Now according to the variety of the humor, and the nature of the places affected, there is a certain difference likewiſe of the Itch. For look how the matter is more or leſs ſharp, ſo the Itch that is excited is more or leſs contumacious and troubleſom. And ſomtimes there is felt an itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the skin of the whol body; and ſomtimes in ſome parts only.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="prognosis">
                        <head>Prognoſticks.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. The Itch is for the moſt part the forerunner of Scabbineſs ſhortly to follow. For if the Itch be of any long continuance, there is then at the length collected a greater abundance of the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this receiving a putridneſs is rendered more ſharp, and it corrodeth the Scarf-kin, and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Puſtules.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By how much the worſe the humor is that exciteth the Itch, by ſo much the worſe is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady alſo. To wit, the Itch that is excited from burnt blood, or Choler, is ſooner ended and gone: but that which proceedeth from ſalt ſlegm laſteth longer; and longeſt of al that which hath its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from burnt Melancholy.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Itch in which there is great pleaſure ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſcratching thereof, is evil, becauſe that it ariſeth from a ſharp Choler.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Itch in old people is ſeldom cured, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe that are decrepit. For ſince that old age is fit for the treaſuring up of theſe ſalt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, that diſpoſition of the body is hardly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and brought unto a better ſtate. And yet notwithſtanding if diligence and care be ſhewn, it is ſomtimes healed. And <hi>Mercurialis</hi> (in his Tract of the Diſeaſes of the skin, Chap. 3.) rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that <hi>Leonellus Pius</hi> (a man fourſcore yeers old) was freed from an extraordinary great Itch by the benefit of Medicaments.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in <hi>Coacis</hi>) writeth that the Itch in thoſe that have Conſumptions (if it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ſuppreſſion and binding of the Belly) is not only dangerous, but deadly. For by reaſon of the trouble and diſquiet of the Itch, thoſe in Conſumptions can neither ſleep, nor take any reſtr; whereupon there is little or no Conconction, and therefore they have their death haſtened upon them.</p>

                        <head>The Cure.</head>
                        <p>The Itch (ſeeing that it is a pain) if it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary great and vehement, and cauſe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, thereby decaying the ſtrength, ſheweth that mitigation by Anodynes is to be procured; but the Cauſe that it dependeth upon calleth for evacuation. And indeed the next Cauſe (ſince that it is a ſals humor ſticking in the Skin) this is likewiſe to be evacuated from the Skin. And in regard that this ſaid next cauſe is nouriſhed by a like humor contained in the Veins, therefore this is likewiſe to be evacuated. And becauſe that this humor is generated from a diſtemper, and vitious diſpoſition of the Bowels, it is therefore to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed: and ſo the generating of ſuch like hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors is to be prevented.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Moiſteners take away the Itch that miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the ſharp matter that is the Cauſe of the Itch. Now thoſe things that evacuate theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humors from the Skin, are thoſe Medicaments, that Cleanſe, Mollifie, and make thin. Purgers take away the Antecedent Cauſe. Alterers amend the vitious diſpoſition of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels; but more eſpecially a good courſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>

                        <p>And therfore in the firſt place the Salt, Nitrous, and ſharp humor is to be prepared and evacuated.

                        <p>And ſometimes alſo Veneſection (if the Age and ſtrength wil bear it) is to be inſtituted: and becauſe that it often falleth out, that either the Haemorrhoids, or the Courſes ſuppreſſed and kept it may afford matter and occaſion unto this Evil; it wil therefore not be amiſs to provoke and draw forth theſe Haemorrhoids, or Courſes.</p>
                        <p>But for the tempering and allaying the heat of theſe Aduſt humors, as alſo of the Bowels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there is nothing that doth it ſooner then the Whey of Goats Milk; which may be given from one pint to three. But it wil be better for uſe if there be added ſome Juyce or Syrup of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory. But that which more eſpecially correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the diſtemper of the Bowels, and maketh for the generating of good blood, is a fit and proper Courſe of Diet. Lee the Air be temperate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining unto cold and moiſt: and the Meats of a good Juyce, of an eaſie Concoction, and that are not eaſily corrupted, theſe may be altered with Borrage, Endive, and eſpecially Lettice; which laſt procureth alſo ſleep which in this Affect is very requiſite and uſeful. But all ſuch meats as are Sharp, Salt, Bitter, Sour, Sweet, Fat, and moſt of all fried meats, are to be ſhunned and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>
                        <p>As touching Topicks, for the mitigating, and moderating of the Itch it ſelf, and for the temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the humors Acrimony, and likewiſe for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing of the humors, a Bath of ſweet Water made blood-warm is of ſingular uſe; in the which the ſick Perſon may ſit for half an hour (or a whole hour) in the morning faſting; becauſe that it doth at once temper the heat and drineſs of the Bowels, and withall rarefie the Pores. But the Medicinal Baths (to wit, thoſe of Sulphur, &amp;c.) are more uſeful in the ſtronger diſcuſſing of the matter; and it wil not be amiſs (by turns) one while to make uſe of a Bath of ſweet blood-warm Water, and another while of that that is ſalt and ſulphury. For ſo by this means both the Itch ſhal be mitigated, the Pores looſned, and the excrements in the Skin Cleanſed away and evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. But for diſcuſſion we may likewiſe make uſe of either common Oyl, or Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds with Salt and Sulphur; as alſo <hi>Oleum Coſtinum,</hi> or Oyl of bitter Coſtus. Or elſe the body may be waſhed with the Decoction of Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, Parietary, the ſharp Dock root, the Seed of the bitter Vetch Orobus, Lupines, White Cicers, Bran. Or,</p>

                     <p>ANd laſtly, among the Affects of the Skin, we muſt not paſs over in ſilence that ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and offenſive ſmel that is ſometimes wont to breathe forth out of the external parts of the body through the Skin; and to be very offenſive, not only to the By-ſtanders, but unto the Perſon himſelf alſo, whoſoever he be that is troubled therewith. For the body of man, whiles it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in its right ſtate ſmelleth not at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it ſend forth any favor that may by any one be perceived. For every living Creature (whatever it be) doth breathe forth ſome kind of Smel proper unto its own kind, as <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> teacheth us in his Book of Smels; and this he proveth by experience; by which we ſee that Dogs find out and follow their Maſters foot-ſteps, by the help they have from this ſmel; and wild Beaſts likewiſe do the ſame in ſeeking their Prey. But yet nevertheleſs if any ſmel ſhal be perceived to come from any one, this is a thing that is preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, as being beyond and beſides Natures In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And as for what <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth (in the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great) that the body of the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> ſent forth a ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſmell, this is a thing very rare; unleſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it come more from the Cloaths, then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                     <p>But that ill and ſtinking ſmels do oftentimes proceed from Mans body, is a thing wel known by frequent obſervation. Now the places from whence the offenſive ſmel cometh, are the Mouth, the Arm-pits, the Privy Parts, but more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="2609" facs="tcp:49110:116"/> the Feet. But that the Ears and the Noſethrils likewiſe do ſometimes ſtink, this proceedeth from the Ulcers that are in them. Yet ſometimes notwithſtanding, there exhaleth forth a ſtinking &amp; offenſive ſmel even out of the whole body of him that is thus affected: as for the ſtink of the Mouth, we have already ſpoken thereof, in Book 2. Part 1. Chap. 19.</p>
                     <p>But now it is not our Intent, here (in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral) to diſpute of the Nature of ſmels, what it is, and likewiſe by what means the ſweet or unſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this place it is ſufficient that we know, that this offenſive ſmel and ſtink proceedeth from a ſuperfluous humidity putrefying, and exhaling ſuch a like vapor.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Hircus</note> The ſtinking ſmel of the Arm-pits is called <hi>Hircus. Avicen (Septima quinti,</hi> Tract. 3.

Which Opinion although that <hi>Avicen</hi> rejectech it, and that by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the cauſe of this ſmel is ſaid to be the aſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pores of the Skin in that place, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which the vapors cannot freely breathe through and exhale: yet notwithſtanding, this conſtriction or ſhutting up of the Pores is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; for if it were ſo, then this Affect ſhould be moſt familiar unto old people. And this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion albeit thus rejected by <hi>Avicen,</hi> doth not in any thing ſeem to be abſurd. For we know well that this Affect is moſt familiar unto Virgins that are marriageable, if at any time they grow hot with motion. And that the Teſticles, and the Seed have in them a full power of imprinting ſuch an offenſive and ſtinking ſmel upon the blood, we may ſufficiently know it from Goats, and other living Creatures that are gelded.

                        <p>Let the Diet likewiſe be ſo ordered that it may tend toward drineſs, and reſiſt putridneſs.

And if the ſaid offenſive ſtink cannot otherwiſe be obſcured and palliated, we are then to make uſe of perfumed Garments, ſweet Bals, Balſams, and the like. But it is better to take away the Cauſe of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive ſmel, than to go about by ſweet ſcents and perfumes to obſcure and palliate it; ſince that perfumes unleſs they be very ſtrong, they mingle themſelves with the ſtink, and are but as it were a vehicle unto it, and ſo cauſe the ſmel to be the more unſavory. Whereas the truth is, that he that ſmels of nothing at al, ſmels beſt of al.</p>
                        <p>There is extant in the Phyſical Epiſtles of that famous Phyſitian <hi>Georgius Horſtius,</hi> Book 2. Sect. 10. a very memorable Hiſtory of a ſtinking and offenſive ſmel proceeding from the whol bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: where Dr. <hi>Sigiſmund Snitzerus</hi> writeth unto Dr. <hi>Andreas Libavius,</hi> that a certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtane Virgin (ſeventeen yeers of age) was ſent unto <hi>Bamberg,</hi> and there put into the Monaſtery of the holy Sepulchre, that ſo ſhe might live as a Recluſe and Nun of the ſaid Order. And that ſhe was no ſooner entered into that Monaſtery, but ſhe ſent forth a ſtinking ſmel (not unlike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of a dead putrefying Carcaſs) greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and diſpleaſing unto the reſt of the Nuns; whether ſhe kept them company in their common meeting place, or elſe kept her ſelf cloſe and mew'd up in her own Cell; for even here alſo they ſmelt her as they paſſed by: but a diligent enquiry and ſearch being made into the cauſe thereof, he came (as he writeth) at length to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that this ſtink of hers proceeded not from any thing amiſs in her Mouth, Stomach, Womb, or any other particular part of the Body, but from the general habit, temper, and conſtitution of the whol body. Yet nevertheleſs <hi>Libavius</hi> (in his Epiſtle wherein he returneth an anſwer) doth not admit of this ſaid proper Conſtitution and temperament of the whol Body; in regard that to render the reaſon thereof, is beyond the reach and power of any man living; but he rather thinks that ſomthing happening from without brought upon her that alteration of her ſubſtance, and ſo cauſed this offenſive ſmel. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth indeed, that this diſtemper was contracted in the Womb from the pollution of the blood, and the corrupted ſeed; and that it did conſiſt and was nouriſhed in the Womb of the Mother: or that this Maiden (being then but an <hi>Embryo</hi> in the Womb of the Mother, while it yet lay therein) ſuffered ſomthing from the nauſeouſneſs and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of the Mother, and from affrightment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling her, or from ſome grievous Affect that ſhe lay under. He conceiveth moreover, that the Mother might be affrighted and terrified upon the ſight of ſome Sepulchre, or that ſhe happened to come in place where they were anointing ſome dead body; or that ſhe took conceit, and a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the putrid and ſtinking Excrements that
<pb n="2611" facs="tcp:49110:117"/> flow from ſuch as lie in child-bed; or elſe that ſhe was ſome way or other greatly affected by theſe and the like accidents. You may read more hereof in the alleadged Epiſtle of <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And another Example of the ſtink of the whol body the ſame <hi>Libavius</hi> hath in the following Epiſtle, where he writeth, that he wel knew a certain yong woman, that after ſhe was married, and living in Wedlock, (while ſhe had her Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) had ſuch a ſtink coming from her, as never Jakes had worſe; and that during this time her Husband lived very diſcontentedly, as one much afflicted therewith.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the faults of the Skin, we wil (and that not unfitly) ſubjoyn thoſe things that are amiſs in the Hair. For the Hair is fixed in the Skin; neither is it any where elſe to be found but in the Skin. Neither indeed are the Vices of the Hair to be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over in ſilence, in regard that even theſe are (although ignoble, yet) parts of the body. For as no man can wel deny, That the Nails, the Hoofs, and Horns of al living Creatures, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the Feathers in Birds are parts of their body; and that none can wel ſay that a Peacocks Tail, and al the various Feathers in Birds that are of ſo many ſeveral colors; I ſay, as none can wel affirm that theſe Feathers affording ſo great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety are a thing meerly excrementitious, and not parts of their body: ſo likewiſe it is in no wiſe to be denied, that the Hairs are alſo a part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And this we are ſufficiently taught by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of them, by their various figure, and their different colors. The ſame is likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the uſe of them, and ſo alſo by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; touching which we ſhal ſpeak hereafter; and eſpecially that we cal <hi>Plica Polonica.</hi> And laſtly, That very effective and conformative power that the Hair hath as wel as other parts, (as we ſhal by and by ſhew you) cleerly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrateth the truth of this. And the growing of the Hairs again after their being cut, doth not in the leaſt prove that they therefore are no parts. For both the Nails, and the Hoofs, the Claws of Lobſters, and in certain bruit Beaſts the Horns, after they are ſhed and fallen off, yet they grow forth again; and ſo do likewiſe the Teeth in Men and Women.</p>
                     <p>We are indeed vulgarly (but erroneouſly) taught, That Hairs are generated when from the heat of our bodies fuliginous, and thick vapors are out of the third Concoction elevated in the parts of our body, and are driven unto the pores of the Skin; in the ſtreight paſſages whereof whiles they ſtick, they are there conglutinated, until at the length the pore being filled up, other vapors coming underneath drive it forward; and theſe vapors are likewiſe followed cloſe by other vapors, and after them by more, and ſo in the end they are thruſt forth out of the pore, and the hair is formed; which afterward (the like vapors ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and thruſting forth the hair) and agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinating themſelves unto the root thereof it thence cometh to be prolonged.</p>
                     <p>But now if the Hair ſhould be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in this manner,<note place="margin">The breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hair.</note> a reaſon could not then be given why hair ſhould not alike be bred in al parts of the body; and in thoſe parts where they are bred, why there ſhould be in ſome places more ſtore thereof, in ſome leſs; and why ſome of them are alwaies growing, when others grow not at al. In the Neck and Face there grow no hairs naturally, but in the Head and Cheeks there are great abundance of them; as alſo in the privy Parts, in the Armpits, Eyelids, and above the Eyelids on the Eye-brows. The hair in the head and beard is ever growing, and is continually lengthened out; but thoſe hairs that are in the Eyelids ever keep at one and the ſame length, and moreover they evermore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtraight. And furthermore no cauſe could at al be given, wherefore men only ſhould have Beards, and that women ſhould not likewiſe have them; whenas notwithſtanding women have on their heads moſt uſually the longer hair. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the hair is by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (in his third Book of the Hiſtory of living Creature, Chap. 12.) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is bred toegther with us (ſuch as is the hair of the head, eyelids, &amp; eyebrows) and that that is afterwards bred, to wit, ſuch as at length ariſeth in proceſs of time as age comes on: of which there could no cauſe at al be rendered, if (according to the vulgar opinion) the hairs had their original out of thoſe vapors that break forth.</p>
                     <pb n="2612" facs="tcp:49110:118"/>
                     <p>And therefore there is ſome other cauſe of the hairs original to be ſought for; in the diſcovery of which <hi>Galen</hi> hath alſo been very curious, and taken great pains; inſomuch that he here taketh occaſion (which otherwiſe he doth but very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) to make mention of the wiſdom, power, and goodneſs of Almighty God, the Author and Framer of al things; and he hath here endeavored to examine his Omnipotency and Wiſdom in this particular, and to confute <hi>Moſes,</hi> as we may ſee in his eleventh Book of the uſe of the Parts, Chap. 14.</p>
                     <p>But if we ſeriouſly weigh the matter, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any means grant that the hairs are bred only from the excrements, or the vapors exhaling out of the body, and ſticking in ſome certain places; but we are rather to determine that they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the formative (we may term it the pilifique or hair-breeding) faculty, for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a little before mentioned. And that the hairs are generated, not only from ſome kind of fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vapors, but from a matter that is far more ſolid, and neerly allied unto the matter of the Nails, and Horns, we are taught even by this, that the hairs are not eaſily corrupted, but are (even after death) preſerved a long while whol and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. Touching which <hi>Gabriel de Zerbis</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a Hiſtory (in his Book of the Anatomy of Mans Body, in the Title of the Anatomy of the Hair, fol. 15.) in theſe very words: <hi>At</hi> Rome <hi>we both ſaw and touched</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the dead body of a Woman buried in the way called</hi> Appia <hi>(juſt oppoſite unto the why where</hi> Cicero <hi>was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: and therefore it was the conjecture of the moſt, that this Carcaſs was the dead body of</hi> Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liola <hi>the dearly beloved Daughter of the ſaid</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero, <hi>as it might be underſtood by the Inſcription: this Carcaſs was taken out of the Grave, wherein by means of great ſtore of Myrrh, and ſome Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my likewiſe, it is believed that it had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from corruption, from the time of</hi> Cicero, <hi>even unto the time of Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>the fourth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer upon one thouſand five hundred yeers. In this Carcaſs there was good ſtore of Hair, adorned, and tied up with a Golden Fillet; as it was then the Cuſtom to bury thoſe of her age. This Carcaſs (having been alſo generally view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſundry Spectators, and almoſt by al the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as wel as by my ſelf) was from thence removed and brought to</hi> Rome, <hi>where in three daies time (the meanes that preſerved it being now far diſtant from it) it putrefied, and was ſoon reſolved into its firſt principles, and became mingled with the Earthy Element wherein it lay.</hi> And ſo altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame manner, like as the Nails in Men and Women, the hoofs and horns in four-footed Beaſts, the painted and variouſly colored Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Birds are produced by the Formative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; and if they chance to fal off they are again renewed in the ſame manner; even ſo likewiſe the hairs are generated by the formative or pili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick faculty that is by the Creator implanted in ſome certain parts; and hence alſo it is that there oftentimes ariſeth ſuch a great variety of colors in the hair. For (as we have already ſaid) the hair in the head and beard is from day to day augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and lengthened; but it is not ſo in the hair that is in the Eyelids and Eyebrows, which for the moſt part evermore keepeth at one and the ſame length. Moreover the hairs in the Eyelids ſtand alwaies ſtraight forward; and if either their length be increaſed, or their ſtraightneſs incurva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they then hinder the ſight, and cauſe an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. Men have beards, Women have none: the Creator, to wit, having altogether deſtined theſe hairs unto a certain uſe; and therefore he hath given this pilifique or hair-breeding faculty unto ſome parts, and not unto other ſome; which ſaid faculty formeth the hairs, for their certain quantity, figure, and color. In Man-kind and Animals there groweth no hair under the feet; the Hare alone excepted, which (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in the third Book of his Hiſtory of living Creatures, Chap. 12.) hath hair growing under the feet. And this moreover argueth that the hair in Animals proceedeth from the formative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to wit, for that by the ſtrength and force of Imagination the form and color of the hair may be changed, as out of the 30. Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> in the Hiſtory of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſufficiently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>The matter of the Hair (as of al other parts of the body) is the blood,<note place="margin">The matter of the Hair.</note> as likewiſe <hi>Adrianus Spigelius</hi> (in his fift Book of the Fabrick of Mans Body, Chap. 10) hath determined; and this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appeareth plainly in the Affect we cal <hi>Plica Polonica,</hi> in the which if the hairs be cut, there iſſueth blood out of them; but this blood is of the meaner and more ignoble ſort. For Nature doth the part, and diſchargeth the office of a good and provident Houſ-keeper, (diſtributing unto each particular perſon in the Family what properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto him) and with the beſt and pureſt part of the blood ſhe nouriſheth the more noble and worthy parts of the body, diſtributing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue unto the ignoble and leſs principal parts, to wit, into the Nails and Hairs in Man-kind; and in Bruits, into the Hairs, Hoofs, Horns, and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: of which we have already likewiſe ſpoken, in the third Book of our Inſtitutions, Part 1. Sect. 2. Chap. 3. But although it be true that the Hairs proceed from the more ignoble part of the blood, yet notwithſtanding it is unctuous, and (if we may ſo ſpeak with the Chymiſts) very Oyly, and Sulphureous as it were (as appeareth by the burning of them) as having I know not what kind of neer alliance with the ſeed; and from hence it is that ſuch as are luſtful and ſalaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are likewiſe hairy; and thoſe on the other ſide that are not inclined unto Venery are ſmooth and without hair; and hence it is that Eunuchs
<pb n="2613" facs="tcp:49110:118"/> and effeminate Perſons produce no Beard; and thoſe that are exceſſive and immoderate in the uſe of <hi>Venus</hi> are ſoon bald; and on the contrary, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs are never bald.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The uſe of the Hair.</note>From al which we may likewiſe ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily collect what the uſe of the Hair is. For certain it is that they have their peculiar and proper uſes; ſince that the Hairs on the Head are (as it were) the Natural Covering thereof; the Hairs in the Eye-lids do after their manner conduce unto and further the ſight; and when they are pulled forth or fall off of themſelves, it much prejudiceth and hindereth the ſight; the Hair of the Head, and the Beard, in men eſpecially, ſerves as a great ornament unto Man, and they render him more venerable (as it were) in the account of others. But now in regard that the Hair under the Arm-pits, in the privy parts, and in the Thighs, is given us by Nature neither for a Covering, nor yet for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, therefore we may conclude that Nature in the production of theſe Hairs ſought ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, and intended ſome other uſe; to wit, that hereby in the generating of theſe Hairs the more ignoble part of the blood may be conſumed: from whence likewiſe it is, that in ſome they grow forth and appear more abundantly, and in others more ſparingly; as Infants alſo are (in moſt parts of their body) altogether void of Hair; which notwithſtanding are afterwards ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in them as they encreaſe in yeers, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Hair being more and more heaped up together.</p>

                     <p>ANd therefore, ſince that the Hairs are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the formative or Hair-breeding faculty, they have their Natural Conſtitution, which conſiſteth in their Natural magnitude, and ſtore, figure and color; which ſaid Conſtitution when once it is loſt, they are then ſubject unto many different Vices; which if you pleaſe to call Diſeaſes, I wil not gainſay you. And indeed the firſt Vice is in the defect of them; and this is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natural, &amp; ſuch as happeneth unto very many according to their age; or elſe it is preternatural. The firſt of theſe is termed Baldneſs; of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort, are, the Shedding or Falling off of the Hair, the <hi>Alopecia,</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis.</hi> There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in all theſe Vices of the Hair a falling off of the Hair from the part (whatever it be) where formerly it was growing; and ſo (in the general) all theſe Vices may be comprehended under the name of <hi>Defluvium</hi> or falling off: but uſe hath ſo far prevailed, that the name <hi>Defluvium</hi> or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off is (in ſpecial) taken for a certain Species of the ſhedding of the Hair, as we ſhal hereafter ſhew you.</p>
                     <p>As for Baldneſs, in the firſt place; look what <hi>Patos</hi> (that is to ſay, the falling down of the Leaves) is in Trees, the like is baldneſs in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, yea alſo in the very Trees themſelves: whereupon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his ſixth Book of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Animals, and Chap. 3. writeth: <hi>Men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of all living Creatures are moſtly ſubject unto baldneſs, and they evidently become ſo ſooner then any other Creature whatſoever. Which kind of Affect is in a manner general. For of Plants likewiſe, ſome of them have all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies green Leaves, others of them loſe their Leaves. The like Affect is baldneſs in thoſe men unto whom it happeneth that they ſhould be Bald. For whenas by little and little (ſome now, ſome then) both the Leaves, and the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the Hairs all off; when this ſame Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhal happen univerſally, then it receiveth theſe words, Baldneſs, falling of the Leaf, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Feathers.</hi> And <hi>Columella</hi> in his fourth Book of Husbandry, Chap. 33. ſaith that the young and tender Cheſnut Tree that is infeſted by Mice and Moles, doth oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bald. Now baldneſs in a man, is a certain ſmoothneſs,<note place="margin">Baldneſs what it is.</note> or defect of Hair in the fore part of the Head, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king its original from the want of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this moſt commonly chanceth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the progreſs of yeers; but yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs unto ſome it happeneth preternaturally; which is thereupon to be accounted preternatural and vitious.</p>
                     <div type="causes">
                        <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                        <p>Touching the Cauſes of Baldneſs, Phyſitians do indeed very much differ in their Opinions. But if we wel weigh the manner how Hairs are generated in the Head, the buſineſs in Controverſie wil not ſeem at all difficult. For whereas both the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Aliment is ſent and ſupplied unto the Hairs from the Brain more eſpecially; therefore we ſay indeed, that the defect of the neceſſary Aliment is the neereſt cauſe of this ſhedding or falling off of the Hair: yet nevertheleſs this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect proceedeth oftentimes from the Conſtitution of the Brain; to wit, if it become more dry then is meet. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tels us the ſame, in the ſixth of his Epidem. Comment. 3. Tit. 1. where he thus writeth; <hi>the Conſumption of the Brain, and by reaſon thereof baldneſs; &amp;c.</hi> Where (as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in his Comment. upon the place) by the Conſumption of the Brain, that diminution thereof is to be underſtood, that happeneth unto old men from its extraordinary drineſs. For if the Brain once become extreamly dry, then there will be nothing ſuperfluous therein remaining that may ſuffice for the nouriſhing of the Hairs. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth us the ſame, who (in his fifth Book of the Generation of living Creatures,
<pb n="2614" facs="tcp:49110:119"/> Chap. 3.) writeth, that baldneſs is cauſed from the ſcarcity of the moiſt heat and fatneſs, that is to ſay of the moiſt Aliment. For there is in old People an excrementitious humidity, that is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too much abounding, then any want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And indeed, as we have already ſaid, bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is natural unto the moſt, becauſe that in the progreſs of their yeers (and as old age comes on) the Brain in every one becometh more dry then is meet: but yet unto ſome this baldneſs happeneth in their Youth and green yeers, to wit, unto thoſe that from ſome preternatural or violent cauſe have their Brains overdried before the time; which Cauſes may be many. The Chief and moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of them al is the immoderate uſe of <hi>Venus,</hi> that powerfully drieth the Brain. Whereupon it is that before the uſe of <hi>Venus</hi> none groweth bald; Neither are Eunuchs bald at all (in the ſixth Sect. of the Aphoriſms, Aphor. 28.) in regard they loſe not, neither caſt forth any Seed; and ſo the like may be ſaid of Youths, and until they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto ripeneſs of yeers. Women likewiſe are ſeldom or never bald (and yet nevertheleſs <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> teſtifieth that he ſaw two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were bald; in his nineteenth Book of Animals, Chap. 6.) in regard that their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is naturally more moiſt; and therefore the Brain alſo in them is not ſo eaſily and ſoon dryed; and becauſe that Women eject not ſuch ſtore of Seed as the Men do. The Brain is likewiſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much (and overſoon) dried by too much Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Study, and Cares.</p>
                        <p>As for that opinion of <hi>Actaurius,</hi> who in the firſt Book of his Method, Chap. 5. aſſigneth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much humidity for the Cauſe of baldneſs, if any one hath a mind to reconcile it with the opinion of <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> he cannot more fitly explain it, then by ſaying that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Alimental humidity is indeed the Cauſe of Baldneſs; and yet notwithſtanding that excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humidity cauſeth that this baldneſs happeneth ſo much the ſooner and more eaſily: after the very ſame manner that Leaves of Trees fal off indeed by reaſon of the want of neceſſary Aliment; and yet nevertheleſs they fal off ſooner and faſter, if any adventitious and Accidental hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity (Rain, or the like) happen.</p>

Which can by no other means be done, than by repairing the aliment of the hair that beginneth to fail, and attracting it unto the skin of the head. And therefore we muſt do our utmoſt that the fat and hot humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by which the hairs are nouriſhed may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and drawn unto the skin. There are ſome likewiſe that add moderate aſtringents, if the skin be become thin through the heat of the head. But whenas baldneſs doth ariſe from the defect of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and whenas by reaſon of drineſs the pores and paſſages of the skin are cloſed and altogether ſhut up, there is no need at al of Aſtringents; for if they be adminiſtred, then the Aliment that floweth unto the hairs wil be altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                        <p>Now what kind of Medicaments they are that correct the diſtemper of the head, and the drineſs of the brain, we have already ſhewn you in the firſt Book of our Practice, Part 1. Chap. 4. But that the Aliment may be attracted unto the roots of the hairs, frictions are to be firſt uſed before the Medicaments; which yet notwithſtanding ought, to be moderate, that they may only attract the Aliment, and not diſcuſs it. But theſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to be hot, and ſo attracting, with a moderate aſtriction, by which the Aliment may be drawn unto the roots of the hair, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> in his firſt Book, Chap. 110. and <hi>Galen</hi> in his ſeventh Book of the faculty of Simples, §. <hi>Ciſtus,</hi> commend Ladanum; and yet more in caſe of the falling of the hair, than in baldneſs: yet nevertheleſs very many there are that uſe the ſame likewiſe for baldneſs, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Oyl thereof, which they prepare in this manner:</p>

                        <head>The want of a Beard.</head>
                        <p>We ſaid before that the Beard was an Ornament unto a Man; and therefore if this be wanting in Men, it cauſeth a very great deformity. Now this may fail either altogether, as in Eunuchs, and certain others that are womaniſh and have alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether effeminate bodies: or elſe it breaketh forth very ſlowly, or groweth not ſo thick as it is wont. Al which happen, either from a defect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or elſe by reaſon of the thickneſs of the Skin out of which it is to break forth; or from ſuch a Conſtitution as hindereth the appearing and growth of a Beard.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas the want of a Beard in men of that age wherein Beards are wont to bud and grow forth, doth breed ſome kind of unſeemlineſs and deformity; and that ſuch as are at their ful age (that they may hereby procure unto themſelves both gravity, and reſpect from others) do much deſire and endeavor after a Beard; it is therefore very uſual upon this very account to cal in the help and aſſiſtance of the Phyſitian. But the truth is, the event ſeldom anſwereth the deſire, or at leaſt but very ſlowly, to wit, when Nature of her own accord attempteth the production there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                        <p>But yet nevertheleſs I think it not amiſs here to give you a Medicament or two, for the aforeſaid purpoſe: and more you ſhal have in the Chapter following.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Oyl in which Southernwood hath been boyled two ounces; the aſhes of Bees or Waſps one dram; Mouſ-tirds one ſcruple; (Honey one ounce; Ladanum three drams; Bears fat as much as wil ſuffice: Make a Liniment.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Boyl Mugwort in Oyl, and let the place be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with the Oyl; which maketh very much for the forwarding of the ſlow growth of the Beard. Of,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Pouder of the ſeed of Nightſhade as much as you pleaſe, and Oyl of Eggs a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: mingle them, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Or let the place be often waſhed with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Southernwood, Maidenhair, Golden Maidenhair, Roſemary, and the Reed root; and afterward let it be anointed with the Unguent that is made of Ladanum.</p>
                        <p>And if it be true (as ſome there are that think it is) that theſe Medicaments that even now we
<pb n="2616" facs="tcp:49110:120"/> named, and thoſe that we ſhal hereafter further mention do not al of them generate hairs only by their manifeſt qualities, and by taking away the Cauſes of the falling off of the hair; but that they likewiſe produce hair by ſome occult quality that is in them; ſuch like Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are therefore eſpecially to take place in the production of a Beard, not where there hath been a ſhedding or falling off of the hairs of the Beard, but where they never as yet grew.</p>
                        <p>It is alſo wel known, that it much conduceth unto the ſpeedy growing of the Beard, if the firſt ſoft hairy down upon the Chin be often ſhaved off; by which means the Aliment is the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly allured and drawn unto the Roots of the hair.</p>
                        <p>For the furthering and haſtening of the Beard, theſe following Medicaments are likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Dill, Oyl of Spike, of each five ounces; the tender Sprigs of Southernwood two handfuls; Squils three drams; the beſt Wine three ounces; let them boyl until the Wine be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and then uſe it.</hi> Or,</p>

                     <div type="causes">
                        <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                        <p>There is not one Cauſe alone of this <hi>Defluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> of the Hair, but the Cauſes are many; to wit, Either the want of Aliment, or the pravity of the humors corroding the roots of the hair, or the thinneſs of the skin, not admitting the aliment of the hair. The two former Cauſes have their place in thoſe that are Phthifical; in whom if the hair fal off, this cometh to paſs (as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us in his Comment. Aphotiſm 10. Sect. 5.) becauſe there is here both the greateſt defect of Aliment, and ſomtimes alſo the corruption of the humors. The ſame happeneth for the moſt part in malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Feavers, ſuch eſpecially of them in which (the Brain being withal affected) the ſick perſons are ſeized on by a Delirye or Dotage. For even in theſe Feavers alſo the ſick parties are greatly extenuated, and there is wanting unto the body a neceſſary aliment, and the depraved humors likewiſe lie gnawing at the roots of the hair, and eat them aſunder. The hair alſo falleth off in thoſe that have the French Diſeaſe, by reaſon of the pravity of the humors; which ſomtimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth likewiſe unto thoſe that have drunk poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and it is reported for a truth, That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever toucheth the Salamander his hairs wil ſhed and fal away. Bun ſomtimes alſo the hair fals off by reaſon of the thinneſs of the skin; and this happeneth unto Women, and eſpecially in the Summer time. And hence it is, that thoſe who travel out of <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> or other hot Regions, find now and then this ſhedding of their hair; for by the heat of the Ambient Air the Skin is made thin; and it chanceth alſo that the matter out of which the hair ought to be generated doth withal tranſpire.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Defluvium</hi> or falling of the hair that is in ſpecial ſo called, is eaſily known by the continual ſhedding of the hair. But it is diſtinguiſhed from baldneſs, the <hi>Alopecia,</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis,</hi> becauſe that in Baldneſs the hair fals off in the fore part of the head only; but in <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> the hair fals from al parts of the head, and the head alone; but then in this <hi>Defluvium</hi> (the Affect we now ſpeak of) the hairs fal off in al parts of the body equally, one while more, and another while fewer of them. But from what cauſe it is that they fal off, may be known from the cauſes that went before. For if there went before any ſickneſs that was in it ſelf apt to conſume the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body, it is then credible that the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the hair proceedeth from the ſcarcity of the Aliment. But if vitious, malignant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved humors excite and cauſe any diſeaſe, it is then an argument that the falling of the hair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth likewiſe from the pravity of the humors. If laſtly, there went before cauſes rarefying the skin, it is then probable, that the ſaid <hi>Defluvium</hi> of the hair proceedeth from the thinneſs of the Skin.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. Among al other the ſpecies of the ſhedding of the hair, this <hi>Defluvium</hi> in ſpecial ſo called is moſt eaſily cured; unleſs the cauſe be ſuch as is not to be removed. For the skin hath not as yet contracted any preternatural diſpoſition that is difficultly cured. And therefore it is that the <hi>Defluvium</hi> or falling of the hair that happeneth after acure and malignant Feavers is eaſily cured; when the Feaver being healed, there is an Aliment again ſupplied unto the body; and the hair that is already fallen off is for the moſt part reſtored

                        <p n="2">2. But in the Conſumption ſuch a defect of the Aliment, and ſuch a vice of the humors cannot by any means be amended. And therefore in this caſe there is not only no cure to be had for this ſhedding of the hair, but the ſick perſons die alſo. And therefore in ſuch as are in Conſumptions the falling of the hair is a ſure and certain ſign of Death approaching; as in the fiftth of the Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms, Aphor. 11.</p>

                        <head>The Cure.</head>
                        <p>The ſhedding of the hair is cured by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the cauſe upon which if dependeth. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hairs fal away from the ſcarcity and want of Aliment, it ſheweth us, that we muſt uſe our endeavor that there may be ſufficient aliment bred in the body, and that that which is bred may be drawn unto the skin of the head. If this <hi>Deflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi> be from the depraved humors, and theſe be ſupplied from al parts of the body, they are then to be evacuated; but if they lie only at the roots of the hair, they are then to be diſcuſſed. If theſe humors be of a poyſonous Nature (as in the French Diſeaſe) we ought then to meet with and oppoſe that poyſon. If the Affect proceed from the thinneſs of the skin, the skin is then to be thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened.</p>
                        <p>If therefore this <hi>Defluvium</hi> or falling of the hair ariſe from the want of Aliment, we ought then eſpecially to take care that by appointing a due &amp; meet courſe of Diet there may be generated ſufficient ſtore of good blood. But for the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this unto the place affected, frictions are more eſpecially to be made uſe of. Yea indeed, almoſt before the uſe of any Topicks, the fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or rubbing of the head are to be adminiſtred, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us in his firſt Book of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Medicaments according to the places, Chap. 2. For Friction doth both attract the Aliment unto the head, and alſo ſtrengthen and thicken the skin.</p>
                        <p>If this falling of the hair proceed from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the humors, then univerſal purgations (if need require) being firſt premiſed, the head is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be rubbed, and diſcuſſives are to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred; but yet let the Diſcuſſers be moderate (eſpecially if there be a concurrence of an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant aliment) left that by the exceſſive and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much uſe of them the aliment be likewiſe diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the skin rendered over thin: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ladanum</hi> is very fitly mingled together with the Unguents.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Defluvium</hi> depend wholly upon the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the skin, then we ought to apply thoſe things that condenſe and thicken the skin, <hi>Galen</hi> commendeth eſpecially <hi>Ladanum,</hi> the Oyl of Maſtick, and the Oyl of Myrtle mingled together. Or elſe let Ladanum be diſſolved in Wine, and ſo made uſe of.</p>
                        <p>And Ladanum is alſo very fitly adminiſtred in almoſt every falling off of the hair. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it is of too thick conſiſtence in it ſelf to be anointed with, it is therefore to be diſſolved in ſomthing that is liquid (Wine or Oyl) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch an Oyl is to be made choyce of that may ſatisfie and anſwer the cauſe.</p>
                        <p>But ſeeing that Unguents and Oyls are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom unto many, who wil not endure that their heads ſhould be anointed with Oyntments or Oyls; therefore for theſe we muſt provide Loti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the head (that pleaſe them better) which are to be made or Southernwood, Maidenhair, Golden Maidenhair, Maſtick, Roſes, Roſemary, Ladanum.</p>
                        <p>And we muſt here again repeat what we gave you notice of about the end of the foregoing Chapter, to wit, That there are ſome who appoint (and not without good reaſon) ſuch kind of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments to be made (for the recovery of the hair) that do not only by a manifeſt quality take away the cauſe of the ſhedding of the hair, but ſuch as alſo by an occult and peculiar faculty do conduce unto the breeding of hair; and ſuch as theſe are only known by experience.

                        <note place="margin">Alopecia:</note>THat which is called <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> is a peculiar kind of the falling of the Hair. <hi>Alopecia</hi> is ſo termed from Foxes; becauſe that this kind of ſhedding of the Hair is familiar unto them. But <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiaſis</hi> is ſo called from its figure,<note place="margin">Ophiaſis:</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the bald and ſmooth parts, deſtitute of their Hair, and writhed, ſeem like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Serpents. It is common unto both theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that in them the Hairs fall off <hi>areatim</hi> (as they term it) and hence it is likewiſe that this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady is in the general called <hi>Area.</hi> And <hi>Celſus</hi> in one and the ſame Chapter treateth of <hi>Area,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Area:</note> 
                        <hi>Alopecia,</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiaſis.</hi> Now the name of <hi>Area</hi> is impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Affect from Country Garden-plats. For as there the Beds or quarters are diſtinct, and in certain places only; and as theſe Beds when they are void of Plants are Naked and bare; ſo it is likewiſe in theſe <hi>Areae;</hi> for here in certain places the Skin appeareth ſmooth, bare, and ſlippery. Theſe Affects differ only in their figure. For <hi>Alopecia</hi> hath no certain figure, but (as <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith) <hi>is dilated under any kind of figure.</hi> But the <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> creepeth up and down writhingly like unto a Serpent; and one while being extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the hinder part of the Head it creepeth along on both ſides the Head even unto the Ears, the breadth almoſt of two fingers; and as ſoon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain being carried beyond the Ears it creepeth forward Serpent-like even unto the very Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it ſelf. And moreover there is in the <hi>Ophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſis</hi> far more hurt and danger in the Cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; ſo that not only the roots of the Hair, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Skin it ſelf alſo is eaten and gnawn tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to wit, as far as the roots of the Hair reach.<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis:</hi>
                        </note> And ſo <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> may be thus defined, that they are a falling off of the Hair after the aforeſaid manner, <hi>areatim,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its Original from a corrupt and depraved hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor gnawing aſſunder the roots of the Hair.</p>
                     <p>The Author of the Book of Medicaments ſoon provided, referreth the <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> unto thoſe Affections that vitiate and marr the Colour of the Hair. But we are to know that this is not proper unto the ſaid <hi>Areal</hi> falling off of the Hair; but that this change of Color in the Hair doth either precede the <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſis</hi> (to wit, when from a vitious Nutriment the Hair firſt becometh white, but afterwards they fall off) or elſe the colors of the Hair are changed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis.</hi> For when after the <hi>Areae</hi> Hairs are again bred, they are then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther white, or yellow; like as it is in Horſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the hair is fallen off by reaſon of ſome Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer cauſed by attrition or gauling, there is wont in the place thereof to appear and grow again white hairs; which happeneth from a vitious Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, and the weakneſs of the Skin. And of this <hi>Celſus</hi> gives us notice, in his ſixth Book, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 1. to wit, that the <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> is extended unto the Hair of the Head alone, but that <hi>Alopecia</hi> may be extended even unto the very Beard alſo.</p>
                     <div type="causes">
                        <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                        <p>The Cauſe of both theſe Maladies is a depraved and ſharp humor of (eating aſſunder the roots the Hair) of whatſoever kind it he. But for the moſt part notwithſtanding this Malady i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> cauſed by a ſalt flegm, aduſt, or putrified. Whereupon <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of the differences of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and Chap. 4. writeth, that theſe Vices follow a depraved Nutrition of the Skin of the Head. But that one while the <hi>Alopecia,</hi> &amp; another while the <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> is excited; and that the Hairs do ſometimes conſtitute a ſtrait and direct <hi>Area,</hi> and ſometimes that that is winding and writhed, the Cauſe of this is the great abundance, and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the matter. For if there be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary great ſtore thereof, and it be likewiſe thin, then it equally and alike eateth through the Hair in the more and greater places; but if the Matter be leſs, and mingled with a thick humor, then there followeth an unequal and writhed <hi>Defluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> or ſhedding of the Hair; becauſe that the humors being unequal and mingled do not flow right forward, but creeping along obliquely they gnaw aſſunder the hair.</p>
                        <p>The more remote Cauſes are the heat of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Head, and eſpecially the fault of the firſt and ſecond Concoction, by reaſon whereof ſalt and ſharp humors are generated; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may happen in every age, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it happeneth more eſpecially in Childhood and Youth; and it followeth the Affects, <hi>Tinea, Achores,</hi> and <hi>Favi,</hi> by reaſon of the Cauſes that we mentioned in the Diſeaſes of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                        <p>And ſomtimes likewiſe External and Malignant Cauſes make very much for the generating of this Diſeaſe: among which <hi>Galen</hi> in his firſt Book of the Compoſit. of Medicam. according to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Chap. 2. reckoneth up Muſhroms, becauſe that they make very much for the generating of vitious and corrupt humors. And hither like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe belongeth the poyſon of the French Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, in regard that this alſo eateth through the roots of the hair; which other poyſons may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do.</p>

                        <p>We have already before told you in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects this falling of the Hair differeth from bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that ſhedding of the Hair that we call <hi>Defluvium.</hi> But <hi>Alopecia</hi> differeth and is known
<pb n="2619" facs="tcp:49110:121"/> from <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> by the very figure of the <hi>Area,</hi> and becauſe that in the <hi>Alopecia</hi> the hair only falleth off, without any hurt as all of the Skin. But in the <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> there is not only a falling off of the hair, but likewiſe an excoriation of the Skin. And the very color of the skin is alſo changed; and in ſome it appeareth more whitiſh, in ſome more pale, and in others more black; and if it be prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there floweth forth a ſerous whitiſh blood. Touching the difference between <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis, Celſus</hi> in his ſixth Book, and Chap. 4. hath theſe words: <hi>That</hi> Area (ſaith he) <hi>that is termed</hi> Alopecia <hi>is dilated under all kind of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; and it happeneth in the hair of the Head, and in the Beard. But that which from the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Serpent is called</hi> Ophiaſis, <hi>beginneth from the binder part of the Head, and is not extended above two fingers in length; it Creepeth on both ſides the Head even unto the Ears: and in ſome unto their Foreheads alſo: the former of theſe in all Ages, but this latter only in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> differ from <hi>Tinea,</hi> in this, becauſe that in <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> the Excoriation of the Skin is ſuperficial; and when it is cured, the hair groweth again. But in <hi>Tinea</hi> the exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation and Ulceration is more deep; and the skin is oftentimes ſo corrupted, that the hair never gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth again.</p>
                        <p>As for what concerneth the ſigns of the Cauſes, the Skin it ſelf ſheweth what kind of humor it is that offendeth: which that it may be the more exactly known, the hair that remaineth behind is to be ſhaven away, and the Skin to be gently rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: there are other ſigns alſo that wil inſtruct and teach us what kind of humor it is that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth in the body. The hairs likewiſe that grow anew, by the various colour that they have (according to the Nature of the peccant humor) wil ſhew us what humor is the Cauſe of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> although they bring not much danger along with them, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they cauſe a great deformity: and among the Romans thoſe Slaves that were diſfigured by the ſaid <hi>Area,</hi> and eſpecially by the <hi>Alopecia,</hi> were ſold at a far lower rate then other Slaves. And in our daies alſo, theſe <hi>Areae</hi> (in regard that they cauſe a ſuſpition of the French Pox) are therfore accounted very diſgraceful unto him that is affected therewith.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But whether the <hi>Ophiaſis,</hi> or the <hi>Alopecia,</hi> may be ſooneſt and moſt eaſily cured it is a great queſtion among Authors; and they herein much differ. <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Avenzoar</hi> are of Opinion that <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> is more eaſily cured then <hi>Alopecia.</hi> And on the Contrary, <hi>Alexander</hi> in his firſt Book, Chap. 2. and <hi>Serapio</hi> in his firſt Book, Chap. 1. teach us that the <hi>Alopecia</hi> is more eaſily cured then <hi>Ophiaſis.</hi> But <hi>Celſus</hi> ſeemeth to ſpeak on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Alopecia</hi> of Infants; which in the courſe of yeers and change of age is of it ſelf oftentimes cured. But if <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> be ſuch as are grown to maturity, or likewiſe in one and the ſame age be compared the one with the other, then the <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> ſeemeth to be altogether the more difficult to be cured, in regard that it hath its original from a matter more thick and far worſe then the former, and ſuch as doth not only eat aſſunder the roots of the hairs, but likewiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the very Skin it ſelf; which is never done in the <hi>Alopecia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Yet notwithſtanding by how much the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger either of theſe Maladies hath been and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, by ſo much the more difficult is the Cure thereof; and by how much the leſs while they have continued, by ſo much the more eaſily are they cured.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If by Rubbing the place become red, there is then hope of Cure; the ſooner it is thus, the more eaſie the Cure: but if it wax not red at all, then there remaineth no hope at all of any Cure.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That kind of <hi>Areae</hi> is alſo the worſt that hath made the Skin thick, and ſomwhat fat, and ſlick or ſlippery in all the parts affected.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> that proceed from the Leproſie are altogether incurable; and that that hath its original from the French Diſeaſe is not to be Cured untill the Diſeaſe it ſelf be Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. There then ſhines forth ſome hope of a Cure to follow, when the excremities of the Areae that are neereſt unto the remaining hairs do again begin to ſend forth other hair. For then thoſe parts that are nigh unto the ſound have the leſs receded from their Naturall State, and ſo conſequently will the ſooner again return unto their Natural State, and begin to produce hair.</p>

                        <head>The Cure.</head>
                        <p>If a Vitious humor abound in the whole body, this is firſt of all to be evacuated, for otherwiſe it wil continually cheriſh the Malady, by fomenting the matter thereof. And ſo if the French Diſeaſe be Joyned therewith, this is firſt to be cured; in regard that the <hi>Areae</hi> cannot be taken away, unleſs this be firſt removed. As likewiſe the diſtemper of the Bowels upon which the breeding of the vicious humors doth very much depend, is to be corrected. And the antecedent Cauſe being taken away, the Containing Cauſe of the <hi>Areae</hi> is then to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; which <hi>Galen</hi> doth by Repreſſers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtives; but we ought withal to do our endeavor, that the skin may be reſtored unto its natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                        <p>And therefore in the firſt place the whol body is to be purged by fit and proper Medicaments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of the peccant humor. And
<pb n="2620" facs="tcp:49110:122"/> moreover <hi>Galen</hi> for the particular evacuation of the head, adminiſtreth Apophlegmatiſms alſo, which we have elſewhere explained.</p>
                        <p>But for the matter which is yet in its flux, and in the beginning thereof, before the <hi>Areae</hi> are yet made, <hi>Galen</hi> maketh uſe likewiſe of Repellers. And the ſame likewiſe we are taught by <hi>Avicen;</hi> where he telleth in that the Medicaments in the <hi>Alopecia</hi> ought likewiſe by a moderate aſtriction to corroborate the skin of the head; for in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth part of his fourth Book, Tract. 1. Chap. 6. he ſaith thus: <hi>And it is requiſite that there be in thoſe Medicaments a comforting and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thereby to prevent and hinder in the head the reception of malignant matter.</hi> But otherwiſe, and if the <hi>Alopecia</hi> and <hi>Ophiaſis</hi> be already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, Repelling Medicaments have then no place; even as likewiſe they have no place in <hi>Scabies</hi> or Scabbineſs.</p>
                        <p>But if the <hi>Areae</hi> be already made, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impacted into the skin, we ought then to uſe Digeſtives. Now theſe are hot, of thin parts, and not greatly drying. For if we make uſe of thoſe things that dry overmuch, not only the vitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, but even the very aliment of the hair wil be then diſcuſſed. Yea, ſince that in the <hi>Areae</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the diſtemper of the skin is hot and dry; therefore cold and moiſt Medicaments are to be mingled with the reſt.</p>
                        <p>But now theſe Medicaments that take away the nigheſt cauſe of this Malady, are termed <hi>Metaſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critica;</hi> of the preparing of which <hi>Galen</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his firſt Book of the Compoſition of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments according to their places, Chap. 2. and in his fourteenth Book of the Method of Phyſick, Chap. 12. To wit, in the firſt place, if there yet remain any hairs that are corrupted, theſe are to be plucked out either with the <hi>Volſella</hi> (an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument purpoſely made to pul out hairs) or they are to be drawn forth with a <hi>Dropaciſm,</hi> or elſe the place may be ſhaven with a Razor. And then afterward let the head be waſhed with a Ley in which Maidenhair, Golden Maidenhair, Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernwood, and the like Plants have been boyled. After the waſhing, let the place be rubbed with a Linen cloth (that is not over moiſt, nor yet over dry) until the skin begin to be red: when this is done, then let Topicks be adminiſtred. Now ſuch like Medicaments are, Muſtard ſeed, Creſſes, white Lily Roots, which (as it is ſaid) wil like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reſtore thoſe hairs that burnt places have been deprived of by fire or ſcalding; Rocket ſeed, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro, Oyl of Bayes, liquid Pitch, Sulphur, the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and aſhes of Southernwood, the Root of Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, and Hellebor, the ſeed of Staveſacre, and Doves dung; and (theſe being the ſtrongeſt and moſt powerful of al) Thapſia and Euphorbium. Which aforeſaid Medicaments notwithſtanding by how much the newer and freſher they are, by ſo much the ſharper they are alſo; and the older they be, the more they lay aſide their ſharpneſs and tartneſs. But out of theſe ſuch of them are to be made choyce of that are proper and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto each of theſe Affects; and theſe are alſo rightly to be adminiſtred. For thoſe Medicaments that were by us even now mentioned, they are not al of them fit for al kinds of <hi>Areae,</hi> or at al times, or after any manner adminiſtred, or in al ages; but unto each of theſe there are ſuch Medicaments as are fit and proper; and each of theſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have likewiſe their due time and manner of uſe: and unto the Malady when it firſt begins, (and being yet but ſmal) the weaker ſort of them are to be adminiſtred; but if the Malady be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, then the ſtronger ſort of them: and unto the ſofter bodies (ſuch as are the bodies of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Women) the weaker Medicaments; but unto ſuch as are at their ful age, and unto Men, the ſtronger ſort of Medicaments are to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                           <hi>Galen</hi> acquaints us with divers Compoſitions that had been examined by long Experience, and approved of (in his firſt Book of the Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Medicaments according to the places, Chap. 1.) to wit, Thoſe of <hi>Heras, Crito, Oreſtinus, Ortho</hi> the Sicilian, <hi>Cleopatra, Archigenes, Aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias, Dionyſodorus, Soranus,</hi> and others.</p>

                        <p>Take <hi>Euph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In the Malady that is more mild it wil be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to uſe a Medicament made of Southernwood, or the roots of the Reed burnt, mixt and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with old Oyl, Oyl of Bayes, or liquid Pitch. Or,</p>

                        <p>This that followeth is yet more mild, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit for Women and Children.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Southernwood, the aſhes of the Root and Rind of the Reed, Frankincenſe, of each of
<pb n="2621" facs="tcp:49110:122"/> theſe equal parts; Bears Fat, and Oyl of bitter Almonds, of each as much as wil ſuffice, and make a Liniment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if it be needful to make it ſtronger, then add thereto <hi>Spuma Maris,</hi> live Sulphur, Bulls Gall, Rocket ſeed, Nitre, or even Thaplia alſo. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Muſtard ſeed, Thapſia, the ſeed of Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, equal parts of them al; when you have bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them into a very fine pouder, then add Oyl of Bayes, and Roſin, of each alike, as much as will ſuffice; and at the fire make hereof an Emplaſter according to art.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such like Medicaments (good ſtore of them) are likewiſe extant, and in divers places here and there, in the Writings of <hi>Valeſcus de Taranta, Rondeletius, Vallerius, Trincavellius,</hi> and other Practical Phyſitians.</p>
                        <p>And this is likewiſe in the uſe of the ſtronger ſort of Medicaments to be obſerved, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the more liquid and ſofter Medicaments, and ſuch as are tempered by the mixture of Oyls (that ſomwhat abate the force of the ſtronger Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments) may be adminiſtred; and after the uſe of the firſt Medicament we are to look what alteration it hath made in the part affected; and afterward (as need ſhal require) the ſtrength thereof is either to be augmented or abated. Now whether or no there be any alteration made may be diſcovered by this eſpecially, if we take notice, and wel obſerve, whether the skin after the uſe of the Medicament be made ever a whit the redder, or no; or whether it were made red by a light and gentle, or elſe by a ſtronger friction. For we ought to be very cautious, that the skin be not burnt through by the too often repeated uſe of the ſtronger Medicaments. And as touching the uſe of Compound Medicaments, you are likewiſe to take this advice, to wit, That if the hair be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſhaven off, it wil be then more convenient to apply Medicaments of a more ſolid form, ſuch as are Emplaſters: but if the hair be not ſhaven away, then thoſe Medicaments that are liquid and ſoft, ſuch as are Liniments and Unguents.</p>
                        <p>But then the weaker Topical Medicaments are to be continued unto the head both day and night, that ſo they may exerciſe and put forth their ſtrength and vertue. But if the Medicaments be of the ſtronger ſort, they are then to be detained upon the head ſo long, until there appear to be ſome alteration in the skin cauſed by them, and that there begin to ariſe ſome kind of pain. And therefore in the uſe of the ſtronger, the place affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted is dayly once or twice to be viewed, and if the Medicaments have ſtrongly affected the place, we are then to return to the milder ſort of them; and the place is to be anointed with Gooſe Fat, Oyl of Dill, or the like Anodyne Medicament. For if the ſtronger Medicaments be too long kept upon the skin, it wil burn the ſame.

                  <p>FOr a Man in old age to become grey and hoary in his Head and Beard, is a thing altogether Natural: but yet ſometimes nevertheleſs it ſo happeneth, that immaturely, and overſoon, ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs appeareth in ſome before their old age, yea indeed before they are come to be Men. And furthermore Hoarineſs cometh on and appeareth leiſurely and by degrees.</p>
                  <p>But yet it is obſerved, that ſome perſons have ſuddenly and all on an Inſtant become white and hoary. And to this purpoſe, <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation 312. relateth a Hiſtory of ſomething that happened under <hi>Franciſcus Gonzaga.</hi> This <hi>Gonzaga</hi> having committed and impriſoned a neer Kinſman of his in a ſtrong Caſtle, upon ſuſpition of treachery in him, thereby to reſerve him until he were queſtioned and puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his demerits; news was brought him next morning, that his Kinſman was ſuddenly become all over white and hoary. And the like we read in <hi>Lemnius</hi> in his ſecond Book, Chap. 2. of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions: and in <hi>Hadrianus Junius,</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. upon the Hair: In <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> his <hi>Scipio's Dream;</hi> and in <hi>Coelius Rhodiginus,</hi> in the third Book of Ancient Reading, Chap. 24. and in the thirteenth Book, Chap. 17. And <hi>Cuſpinian</hi> relateth
<pb n="2623" facs="tcp:49110:123"/> many Hiſtories of ſuch as ſuddenly out of fear became gray and hoary; and ſo doth <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Schenkius</hi> relate the like, in the firſt Book of his Obſervat. And of this kind of hoarineſs it is (that cometh immaturely and before its due time) that I am here in this place to treat. For this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect (in regard that it both depriveth a man of his Natural beauty, and likewiſe betokeneth that the health is not right, and as it ought to be; it is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without good cauſe made the ſubject of the Phyſitians care and pains. As for that gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whiteneſs, and hoarineſs that chanceth unto men and women in their old age, and is a Natural ornament of their old age, to endeavor to cover and hide this with fucuſſes and other artificial paintings, is altogether whoriſh, and an Argument of a light, wanton, and luxurious mind.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>It is not to be doubted that natural hoarineſs doth proceed from the change and alteration of the temperament of the body, and the blood that nouriſheth the hair. But here we are to enquire how it cometh to paſs that there ſhould be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch a change as this in the blood and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in thoſe that are yet in their youth and green yeers. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (in his fifth Book of the Generation of living Creatures, Chap. 5.) wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, That the Aliment that produceth theſe white and hoary hairs (when it is not concocted) doth rot and putrefie, and ſo becometh a white hoarineſs; becauſe that the filthy ſnottineſs of them being rotten is almoſt white. And ſo he deduceth this hoarineſs from the defect of Native heat; which when it cannot concoct the humors, theſe humors being deſerted by their natural heat are then the more attempted by an external and adventitious heat, and ſo they become putrefied; from which putridneſs they are made white. <hi>Galen</hi> ſeemeth to follow the opinion of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;</hi> when he tels us in his ſecond Book of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments, Chap. 5. That the hairs are made white, becauſe that the aliment whereby they are nouriſhed is as it were the ſhot of flegm, which in ſpace of time putrefieth. And that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth putridneſs he termeth <hi>Situs,</hi> and we cal it filth, ſnor, or ſnivel: this being ſuch a kind of affection as happeneth unto Bread in the Dog daies, which we therefore call finnowed or hoary Bread. And for this cauſe likewiſe it is (as he writeth) that men are more apt to grow hoary in their Temples, becauſe that the fore part of the head is (by reaſon of its drineſs) more prone to baldneſs; but the Temples, by reaſon of their humidity, and conſequently upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of ſnot and filth from the putrefying of the aforeſaid humidity, are more apt and prone unto hoarineſs. The Opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> in this one thing only ſeemeth to differ from that of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> to wit, That <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh only in the general, without making mention of any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular humor; whereas <hi>Galen</hi> writes that hoari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proceedeth from the putridneſs of flegm alone. And here it is altogether more ſafe, by flegm, to underſtand any ſimple crude humor, then flegm properly ſo called; and that any cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity rather than that putridneſs only which is ſo called, may be the cauſe of hoarineſs. To wit, (that we may in a word or two propound our opinion touching this very thing in controverſie, of which others have ſo largely diſcourſed) ſeeing that the hairs (as we ſaid before) are not genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and nouriſhed from vapors, or excrements ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated in the form and likeneſs of vapors, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the blood, as al other parts are, it is without al diſpute, that the blood that is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in old age is not ſo freſh, flouriſhing, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, as in youth; but that as the body is now haſtening toward death, ſo the blood alſo that is therein bred is nothing ſo good as formerly; which is cleerly ſhewn and manifeſted even by the change and decay of that freſh and lively color of the body, and that witheredneſs that befalleth men and women in their old age. And therefore we are not to wonder, that (ſeeing the blood that nouriſheth the hair is now become far worſe than before) the color of the hair ſhould likewiſe be changed; neither that the hairs (that retain their own natural conformation and nutrition even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a mans death) ſhould only from ſome filth and ſnot (that is wont to happen unto thoſe things that putreſie) ſuffer any ſuch like thing as that we now ſpeak of. But now that in <hi>Vitiligo</hi> and <hi>Leuca</hi> this color is preternaturally changed, it is doubtleſs from this, That in the ſaid Affects there is not ſupplied unto the hair ſo good an aliment, but ſuch as is full of excrements, and eſpecially flegmatick excrements. But in ſuch as are hoary before their time, in theſe no doubt there is a fault and ſomthing amiſs even in the very humors; and if not in the whol body, yet at leaſt in the head and temper of the brain. Neither is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that theſe who are thus hoary in their youth or middle age may come to be thus affected, and to ſuffer what we are now ſpeaking of, either by reaſon of the Seed, or ſome diſpoſition in the Teſticles; and we have already told you before, that evermore the Seed and the Teſticles do make very much in the change of the color of the hair. And again, ſince that the Paſſions and Affects of the mind (eſpecially fear and terror) may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly effect ſuch notable changes in the humors, and that they may likewiſe greatly affect the brain; it is therefore no wonder that in a ſhort time hoarineſs ſhould be produced from that change that is made in the humors. For if from a ſmal Cloud, or the Air, or a hurtful Wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Trees, the color of their Leaves may be changed, and the Leaves m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="2624" facs="tcp:49110:124"/> parts of out body) may likewiſe be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from ſome humor, or ſpirit ſuddenly invading and ſeizing upon them. And this may be alſo confirmed even by that which <hi>Hollerius</hi> (in his firſt <hi>Perioche</hi>) writeth, to wit, That the hairs have ſuddenly been turned white and hoary by the vapor of Hydrarge.</p>

                        <p>As for what concerneth Topicks, <hi>Galen</hi> indeed (in his firſt Book of the Compoſition of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the places, Chap. 3.) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth Medicaments that are hot, and of thin parts, when he had a purpoſe to diſcuſs and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſnotty filth, and to dry up the ſuperfluous humidities in the skin. But unleſs that there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward flow thereto ſuch a like aliment that may again generate hair of the Natural color, ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments as theſe wil avail but little. Others there are therefore that make uſe only of thoſe Medicaments that dye and make black the hair, In doing of which notwithſtanding we are well to heed and weigh what honeſty wil allow of; and withal we are to take heed that by no means we bring any hurt unto the Brain. For theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that make black having moſt of them an aſtringent power, and being withal cold, are very apt to produce the Apoplexy, Epilepſie, deep and profound ſleep, Catarrhs, and the like Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and this <hi>Galen</hi> tels us he hath ſeen and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to befal ſome certain Women in his time.</p>

                        <p>Some few hours after the anointing, let the head be waſhed with a Ley of the aſhes of Beans, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels, in which Litharge hath been boyled; or with a Ley in which the Pulp of Coloquintida

Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theſe kind of Tinctures, this is likewiſe to be taken notice of, That if you wil have them ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and laſting, it wil be very fit that a Lotion of the head be premiſed, that is made with ſuch a like Decoction that both giveth a beginning unto the Tincture, and that likewiſe cauſeth that it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue firm; like as Cloth-Dyers when they intend to dye a piece of black Cloth, they firſt put upon it a red color with Madder, or a Sky color with Woad. And therefore let the hairs that are to be dyed be firſt waſhed with a Ley in which Roch Alum hath been diſſolved. And in the choyce of Medicaments, we are likewiſe to endeavor, that ſuch like Medicaments may be choſen that are no waies unpleaſing in their ſmel, but rather ſuch as are ſweet and pleaſant.</p>

And <hi>Avicen</hi> writeth that if Cloves be added unto theſe kind of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, they wil ſufficiently dye the hairs, and prevent the Brains being hurt by the Tincture.

                        <p>Take <hi>the Coloquintida Apple; make a hole through it, and take forth the ſeeds, and fill it up with Oyl of Bayes and the ſeed of Henbane; let them ſtand for one whol night, and then let the Oyl be preſſed forth, with the which the hair may be anointed.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>of Ley ſive meaſure, Litharge two ouncer; Sage leaves two handfuls; boyl them to the conſumption of the fourth part, and make a Lotion for the head.</hi> Or,</p>

But here to add any more Medicaments is not worth the while, in regard that there are many more of them every where extant.</p>
                        <p>But now theſe Medicament that make black the hair are not only made uſe of for the covering and hiding of hoarineſs; but in out <hi>Germany</hi> a black color of the hair is greatly deſired and endeavored after by ſome certain of our noble Virgins; either that they may ſeem to have ſomwhat Exotick, ſtrange, and forreign; or elſe that they may be differenced from the vulgar and Plebeian young Maidens, unto whom the yellow or golden color of the hair is moſt acceptable, and in moſt account, And thus every one hath ſomthing or other fair in his own eye, and high in his own account, although not ſo in anothers. And therefore theſe Virgins ſeem to me to do juſt as that Blackmoor did that lived in the Court of a certain German Prince, who often ſeeing in the Womens Ward a white Virgin, and withal a black Whelp, he would tel the Virgin that ſhe was not fair and beautiful, but rather that the black Whelp was beautiful and fair; and ſo (as <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> ſaith)
<q>
                              <l>Black ſeems moſt fair</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>But more right is the Judgment of the other Virgins,<note place="margin">What things they are that make the hair yellow.</note> that ſeek and endeavor after a yellow or golden
<pb n="2626" facs="tcp:49110:125"/> color of the hair. Now this yellow color of the hair may be gained, it the hairs be waſhed, and likewiſe their Hair-laces wel wet in that Water or Ley in which the flowers of Broom, or of the yellowiſh Mullein, of the Citron-color'd Staechas or Caſſidony, of Camomile, Citron rind, the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber root, and the root of Gentian, have been infuſed. And likewiſe Lupines boyled in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter make the hair yellow; and ſo alſo doth the Water and Oyl of Honey. And they commonly likewiſe uſe (for the Combing of the hair) the Ley that is made of the Aſhes of Vine ſhoots; which wil be ſomewhat more efficacious, if there be infuſed therein the Leaves of Citrine Staechas, or of Mullein. But there are more of theſe like Medicaments every where to be found.</p>

If theſe Entangled Locks be ſhaven off, that humor and the poyſon thereof ſheds forth into the body, and then (as we wrote before) extreamly tortureth the perſons thus affected; it diſquieteth and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the Head, Feet, Hands, all the Limbs, all the Joynts, and in a word, all the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And it is found by experience, that ſuch as have ſhaven off theſe bundles of hairs ſo cloſely entwiſted within themſelves, that theſe have ſoon after been taken in their Eyes; or elſe have been moſt grievouſly tortured with Defluxions unto the other parts of the body. If we attempt to Cure the Party by the uſual purging Medicaments the affected Perſon is the worſe for them; and the tormenting pain rageth ſo much the more; becauſe that the ſaid purgation is not able to maſter and expel the Noxious offenſive humors, but only ſtirs them abroad, and thereby ſcattereth and diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them throughout the whole body: for (after purging) thoſe that are afflicted with this Peſt are ſo exceedingly tormented with a burning pain of all their Members, that nothing can poſſibly be added unto the ſharpneſs &amp; bitterneſs of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinds of Medicaments have been ſought for, and made trial of, but as yet there hath been found none that would effect the Cure. The force likewiſe and nature of the Diſeaſe, and the cauſe thereof, have been ſought for; but as yet there indeed appeareth nothing of certainty, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching what we have ſought for. The Country Boors give out that they have found great relief by carrying tied about them an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rchin pulled in pieces: and for the total abolition of the ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they make themſelves a meat of the ſaid <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin it ſelf; but yet we find that even in this there is not any thing much available.

                     <p>And yet notwithſtanding there are others that tel us how that this Diſeaſe is very common and familiar even in other Regions alſo. For in the Obſervations of <hi>Schenckius</hi> we may likewiſe ſee, that this Diſeaſe was known alſo unto the <hi>Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goi,</hi> and <hi>Alſatians.</hi> For thus <hi>Schenckius</hi> writeth in the firſt Book of his Medicinal Obſervations, Obſervat. 13. <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with us at this day to be obſerved a certain moſt horrid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combed, and moſt intricate kind of hairie Tufts, both in the head and beard, no whit ſtrange and unuſual unto ours; but altogether unknown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ancient Phyſitians of former times, in what Age ſoever they lived: with which ſuch as are affected, you may ſee them have hanging down (from the reſt of the hair of their head and beard) even unto the ſhoulders, breaſt, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo even unto the very Navel, very long tufts and buſhes of hair, wonderfully intricate, oftentimes a finger thick, exceeding dreadful to look upon, and much reſembling the Gorgont head. Which tufts of hair they ſuffer to grow in a ſloven-like and regardleſs faſhion, for ſome ſuperſtitious ends inducing them thereunto; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil they at al ſuffer it to be cut, neither at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time to be parted and ſevered with the Comb, being altogether perſwaded that the moſt grievous Fomenters of the diſeaſes of the head (that is to ſay, the matter of the Apoplexy, Palſie, Madneſs, and eſpecially the pertinacious Cephalalgie, and the like Diſeaſes) are wholly, or at leaſt in great part conſumed in nouriſhing theſe tufts of hair. And thus being lead either by Superſtition or the long and exact obſervation of other men, they wil admit of any thing, rather than the kembing or cutting ſhort of theſe buſhy locks of hair, as a thing altogether ominous and deadly; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="2629" facs="tcp:49110:126"/> made their Eſſayes both of Experiment, and Hiſtory, they ſtiffly maintain their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But thoſe of them that would be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more neat and ſpruce hide theſe their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med tufts of hair (thoſe of their heads within their hats, but thoſe of their beards rolled up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under ſomthing they purpoſely wear upon their breaſts) that ſo they may not be ſeen. But there are likewiſe others of them, who (although it be even in the publique Aſſemblies) cannot poſſibly conceal theſe monſtrous and deformed buſhes of matted and intangled hair, if they would never ſo fain; neither would they, if they could. So that it is a thing ſo wel ſetled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on (without the leaſt doubt or ſcruple) in the minds both of thoſe that wear theſe horrid and ſtrange intangled locks, and likewiſe of al thoſe that behold them, that even in their publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, without any the leaſt ſhame or diſgrace, and as a thing altogether neceſſary for the ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of life, they expoſe them to open view. And ſome certain of them there are (as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy told you) that during their whol life do in this manner nouriſh and cheriſh theſe their ugly locks, hoping that thereby they may poſſibly be preſerved from al other dangerous and difficult diſeaſes that continually threaten them. The vulgar like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if they chance to light into the company of any thus affected, they then preſently ſuſpect them to be diſeaſed with ſome hidden, undiſcernable, and ſome one or other difficult Malady of the head. In which thing whether their Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on convince their Experience, or their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence exceed and ſurpaſs their Superſtition, I wil not at preſent trouble my ſelf to judg thereof. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this indeed I conceive fit to tel you, That as I incline very much unto the vulgar Opinion; ſo (that I may conceal nothing) I think alſo, that the Seminary of theſe kind of Diſeaſes is not from thence ſo much argued as nouriſhed, and that by this means it may be prevented that they invade not; as we are likewiſe further taught by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion of Phyſitians, touching the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the generation of Hair, the Events, and the Cures; there accrewing alſo (for our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſurance) the common and conſtant atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vulgar, and which at this day paſſeth (as from hand to hand) among them. I have not as yet found that this vice of the hair is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known unto other the</hi> Europeans; <hi>neither is it known in the moſt parts of</hi> Germany: <hi>but unto al the</hi> Briſgoi, Alſatians, Dutch, <hi>and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tracts neer unto the River</hi> Rhine, <hi>it is in a manner Epidemical; and generally wel known likewiſe unto the people where I live. I my ſelf knew here above thirty Citizens (of whom ſome are even yet living) that were famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for this kind of hair. The common people cal it</hi> Marenfletcht, Maren wiirkung, ynd Schrottlinſzopff, <hi>as if we ſhould ſay, The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſions or writhings of the hairs, or the locks, and hairy tufts of the</hi> Incubi; <hi>for they conceit that the</hi> Incubi <hi>and</hi> Fauni <hi>(as the Ancients cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them) draw forth theſe hairs in the night time by ſucking them. Others there are that name them</hi> Marenlock, <hi>that is to ſay, the locks and tufts of Swine, becauſe they now and then obſerve ſome long tufts (like unto the former) growing out of the neck of theſe Swine, and hanging down very low.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for Hiſtories, there are two that in ſpecial he reckoneth up, the one out of <hi>Johan. Stadle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> a Phyſitian; the other out of <hi>Moccius;</hi> and both of them he relateth in their own words. The firſt is this. <hi>Thou bringeſt unto my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that noble perſon</hi> Caſparus <hi>of</hi> Horſtein, <hi>Brother unto the Commendator</hi> Sigiſmund <hi>in</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatia, <hi>and Provincial in</hi> Burgundy, <hi>lately decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; whom when the Commendator on a time ſharply reprehended by reaſon of his uncombed, writhed, and intangled beard, which (horrid and frightful as it was) he ware before him; and withal threatning to remove him from his Table (a man of about fifty yeers of age) unleſs he would cut it off; he then anſwered, that he would more willingly be deprived of his Diet, and freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Court, rather than want his intangled and altogether Gorgonean Beard. This happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the yeer of Chriſt</hi> 1564. <hi>when from</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg <hi>I went to</hi> Alſchuſa <hi>for fear of the Plague.</hi> Thus much out of <hi>Stadlerus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other Hiſtory is thus related: <hi>Of late</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moccius) one raſhly cutting off theſe Locks of an old woman, ſhe died within the ſpace of three daies. For they cry up this as a thing very fatal, even unto ſuch oftentimes as for want of good advice have frivolouſly been hurt: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there are likewiſe ſome that tel us another tale. For we know the man who was wel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a certain Counteſs, that having ſuch a monſtrous head of hair would often cauſe it to be cut, even unto the neck.</hi> This out of <hi>Moccius;</hi> and thus far <hi>Schenckius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have heard from a certain Captain of Horſe, that this Malady is likewiſe not unknown unto the <hi>Hungarians;</hi> and that in <hi>Hungary</hi> not only Men, but even the Horſes alſo are ſubject unto this kind of Diſeaſe; and that he himſelf brought out of <hi>Hungary</hi> as far as <hi>Dreſda</hi> a Horſe that had ſuch a <hi>Plica</hi> or intangled Lock of Hair, hanging down unto the very feet.</p>
                     <p>Unto the aforeſaid Epiſtle of the Rector of the Univerſity of <hi>Zamoſcium, Hercules Saxonia</hi> anſwereth in a peculiar Book, which he entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, <hi>de Plica,</hi> or, of the monſtrous intangled and writhed Hair. <hi>Johannes Thomas Mina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous</hi> hath likewiſe publiſhed the Conſultation they had at <hi>Padua</hi> (touching this ſad Affect) on the 15. of the Calends of <hi>January,</hi> in the yeer 1599. and he inſcribeth it, <hi>de Helotide. Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus a Fonſeca</hi> hath publiſhed likewiſe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation touching this ſame Diſeaſe; the which
<pb n="2630" facs="tcp:49110:127"/> we find in the firſt Tome of his Conſultations, Conſult. 1. Al which are to be ſeen in theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned Authors. But now whether or no the Polonians received any conſiderable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by theſe Conſultations of the Italians, I leave it unto themſelves to judg. I think that to be a very Ingenuous Confeſſion, which that moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and famous man Dr. <hi>Johannes Prevotius,</hi> principal Profeſſor of Phyſick in the Univerſity of <hi>Padua</hi> maketh in that Letter of Advice and Counſel which he wrote unto the Illuſtrious and moſt generous Lord, <hi>Nicolaus Sapieha</hi> chief Standard-bearer unto the great Dukedom of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuania,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Coden,</hi> &amp;c. (I ſhal anon give you the whol Letter at large) where he thus writeth: <hi>The Nature of this poyſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is altogether unknown; ſo that (as it ſeems to me) it was truly ſpoken by that illuſtrious perſon, who ſaid in my hearing, that the Boors inhabiting within his Territories had ſound out more of the original of this</hi> Plica, <hi>the progreſs and the Cure thereof, than any of thoſe Authors that had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten concerning it, of which there hath been never a one of them that as yet hath had the fortune to reſtore unto perfect health any one that hath been afflicted with the ſaid</hi> Plica. The Phyſick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of <hi>Padua</hi> have indeed made trial there of very many Remedies, but al to no purpoſe. The ſame aforeſaid Noble perſon (Count of <hi>Coden</hi>) himſelf told me, that a certain <hi>Padua</hi> Phyſitian induced thereunto (as it were) by the ſignature &amp; ſhape of the Diſeaſe (for they that are affected with the true and perfect <hi>Plica</hi> ſeem in a manner to have Serpents hanging down from their heads, and as it were the head of the Monſter Gorgon) preſcribed him ſome Vipers to eat, but without any ſucceſs at al. And that another of them had provided him a Pſilothrum Oyntment to uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the uſual Ley, perſwading him to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend unto the cutting off of his hair, promiſing him an artificial covering for his head; but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adviſed to the contrary by a German (a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in Phyſick) unto whom this Diſeaſe was not altogether unknown, and one who wel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the danger that was like to follow upon the rooting out al his hair, he therefore refuſed it. But although I dare not arrogate unto my ſelf a perfect knowledg of this Diſeaſe; and albeit that in no caſe we cannot attain unto the perfect and exact knowledg of Diſeaſes that depend upon an occult and ſecret Cauſe; yet nevertheleſs what I know touching the Nature of this Diſeaſe (by means of my converſe with the Noble Earl before mentioned, who was afflicted therewith) and what I conceive touching the Cauſe thereof, I wil here briefly acquaint you with, that in ſo doing I may give a further occaſion and encouragement unto ſuch as live in thoſe Regions where this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is commonly and familiarly known, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh what is come to their knowledg touching this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems not to me to be any new Diſeaſe. For although it hath hitherto been unknown unto the people of <hi>Italy,</hi> and moſt of the European Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet nevertheleſs, I ſee no reaſon at al, why it ſhould not be common and frequent in <hi>Polonia</hi> many Ages paſt as wel as now; ſince that the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that produce the ſame at this day might then be preſent as wel as now; only that there were then wanting Phyſitians that might inquire into, and acquaint us with what they knew touching the Nature of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Now as for the Nature of it, we are firſt to take notice of this; to wit, that this Diſeaſe (as for what concerns the name thereof) is known indeed from the intricateneſs and intangling of the hairs: yet notwithſtanding that the ſaid <hi>Plica</hi> is only ſomwhat that is Critical as it were, ariſing from the expulſion of the vitious matter out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and that the ſaid <hi>Plica</hi> bringeth no danger at al along with it unto the affected perſon, who oftentimes bears it about with him al his whol life, without any the leaſt damage. But that which moſt of al threateneth danger unto the diſeaſed party is that vitious humor which yet ſticking faſt in the body exciteth thoſe moſt grievous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that have been before recounted in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of this Diſeaſe; which ceaſe al of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, ſo ſoon as the matter is thruſt forth unto the hair.</p>
                     <p>And moreover, this is further to be added unto the Hiſtory, That in ſuch as are thus affected, eſpecially if the Diſeaſe proceed unto the height, not only the hairs are vitiated, but the nails alſo, and more eſpecially in the feet, but moſt of al in the great Toes thereof, which become rough, long, and black, like unto the horn of a Goat; and this I obſerved in the afore mentioned noble Lord <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus Sapieha;</hi> and I have heard that the very ſame hath alſo befallen unto others.</p>
                     <p>But now this Vice is not without cauſe referred unto and reckoned among Diſeaſes, in regard that the hairs are not wholly to be excluded out of the number of the parts, And it is to be referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Diſeaſes of Conformation, ſeeing that the hairs neither retain that figure that they ought na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to have, neither do they every of them appear ſingle and ſevered, as they ſhould, but are variouſly complicated among themſelves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſted one within the other, ſo that of many hairs there is made one long, thick, intangled, and frightful lock. And yet notwithſtanding that the Diſtemper of the hairs is likewiſe changed cannot be denied, in regard that there floweth unto them a preternatural humor, and ſuch like hairs as theſe when they are cut pour forth blood.</p>
                     <p>As touching the Cauſes thereof, in the firſt place, theſe things that are commonly believed and by tradition paſs from hand to hand, touching the paines that is taken by the <hi>Incubi,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants not baptized, and other Spirits beſides; in the weaving of the long, ugly and frightful Locks
<pb n="2631" facs="tcp:49110:127"/> there is none but may eaſily perceive that they are meerly fabulous and ſuperſtitious. But that this vice of the hair, as wel as many other Diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, may ſomtimes proceed from Witchcraft and Inchantment, appeareth even by the Obſervation of <hi>Chriſtophorus Rumbaumus,</hi> Doctor and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Phyſick, and my fellow Citizen, which <hi>Hercules Saxonia</hi> reporteth to be Extant in the Obſervations of <hi>Johannes Schenckius</hi> the Elder, in the ſeventh Book, in theſe very words of <hi>Rumbau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. In the yeer</hi> 1590. <hi>while I was a long time beſtowing my pains (though all in vain) in the Cure of a Mans Wife (who out of the Lees of Beer artificially deſtilled Brandy Wine at</hi> U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But upon the very firſt pouring on of the water all the Locks of one ſide of the Head, as it were all beſmeared with Birdlime, become on a ſudden ſo intricate and intangled that afterward (as long as ſhe lived) they could by no means, wit, or device, be extricated and ſevered as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; but continued thus in long entangled Locks, very frightful to behold, even unto her dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day. And this we conceive to be wrought meerly by Witchcraft.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I think this to be very rare; and that this Vice proceedeth from ſome internal Cauſe we are taught even by this, that in thoſe places Bruits likewiſe are taken with this affect. But now what kind of humor that is, we ſhall find it very difficult to explain. Very many there are (and indeed the moſt) who refer the Cauſe of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady unto a certain viſcid and ſlimy humor. But theſe fal ſhort of the truth. For in many bodies, and many Regions likewiſe, theſe viſcid Clammy humors are generated, which yet notwithſtanding produce no ſuch Diſeaſe. For neither may theſe pains of the Limbs, Convulſions, and other Symptoms, be referred only unto a viſcid humor; neither can any reaſon be rendered, why this matter ſhould be thruſt forth only unto the hairs, and unto no other parts. But what the Nature of this humor is, the nouriſhing of our body and the generating of other Diſeaſes, may in ſome meaſure inſtruct us. For although all the parts are nouriſhed by the blood; yet nevertheleſs, as divers Plants do from the ſame Earth attract (each one of them) that Aliment that is proper and familiar unto them, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teſtifieth, in his Book <hi>de Natur. human.</hi> Text. 31. even ſo likewiſe one of the ſame Maſs of blood contained in the Veins, every one of the parts attracteth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf that Nutriment that is moſt familiar unto it. It happeneth moreover that if the blood be leſs pure, that excrementitious aliment is carried more unto one part then unto another. And this is plainly to be ſeen even in the Joynt-Gout <hi>(Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thritis)</hi> where that ſame ſerous wheyiſh matter, ſalt, and tartareous (or cal it how you pleaſe) is carried more unto the Joynts, then to the fleſhy parts. A proof of this we have likewiſe from the ſtone <hi>Oſteocolla</hi> (which is very fitly adminiſtred in the fractures of the Bones) where we find that the very bones themſelves attract unto them the ſaid Stone; ſo that it is by experience found, that from the overmuch uſe thereof there have grown forth Callous ſubſtances extraordinary great, and unſightly: of which ſee <hi>Gulielmus Fubricius,</hi> in his firſt Century, and Obſervat. 91. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am of Opinion, that in thoſe places where this Diſeaſe is Epidemical, the fault is in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the place, and in the Waters, which flow down from the mountains of <hi>Hungary</hi> into <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> (and in <hi>Biſgoia,</hi> if this Diſeaſe be likewiſe familiar in that Region, from the <hi>Alps:</hi>) which ſupplieth unto the hair an abundant Nutriment, but unto al other parts of the body ſuch an aliment as is altogether unuſeful, and which is worſe, very hurtful; which when Nature expelleth) unto the hairs, the reſt of the body is thereby freed from all other grief whatſoever, and the hairs alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vitious. And I am the more confirmed in this my Opinion by what was related unto me by the aforeſaid Illuſtrious Lord Count <hi>Nicolaus Sapieha;</hi> that he knew a Boor in <hi>Polonia,</hi> that by bathing Cured ſuch as were troubled with this Diſeaſe; by the uſe of which the firſt ſeven daies the ſick perſons became very hairy all their body over, the hairs breaking forth in all parts; which (upon continuing the uſe of the ſame Bath for ſeven daies more) fell off again, and ſo the Diſeaſed perſons recovered their health. And indeed that ſome Waters have in them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and admirable virtues will every where appear unto us in the Writers of Naturall Hiſtory. So in the <hi>Alpes, Styria,</hi> and <hi>Carinthia,</hi> by the fault of the Water, the Tumors, <hi>Broncho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celae</hi> and <hi>Strumae</hi> (we cal this laſt, being a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Neck, the Kings Evil; the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſwelling in the throat) are Natural and as it were bred together with the Inhabitants, the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter being thruſt forth unto the Glandules in the Neck, and into no other places.</p>
                     <p>And yet nevertheleſs, I would not have it thought that I do hereby altogether exclude the
<pb n="2632" facs="tcp:49110:128"/> Air, which it muſt be confeſſed hath likewiſe a very great power in altering our bodies; and it cauſeth that in theſe, or thoſe Regions and bodies, theſe or thoſe humors are generated. Although it be likewiſe true that the ſaid Air hath not this power from it ſelf, but that it receiveth the ſame from whoſe vapors that are lift up and raiſed from the Waters, and out of the Earth which the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waſheth upon, and paſſeth through. And for this reaſon it is, that this Malady is not general and Univerſal throughout the whole Kingdom of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> but only familiar unto ſome certain places thereof, in regard that it alwaies ſpreadeth and rageth there, and yet is not from thence diſperſed into any other Regions; and this Diſeaſe <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Saxonia</hi> acknowledgeth to be Endemick; but he wil by no means have it to be Epidemick; as we may ſee in the tenth Book of his Practice of Phyſick, and Chap. 7. of <hi>Plica.</hi> But we have already told you (in the ſecond Book of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, Part 1. Chap. 11.) that he did not wel underſtand, and therefore could not rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto us the Nature of a Diſeaſe Epidemick and Endemick.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſaid Matter is carried unto the hair, not (as ſome would have it) in the form of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, but together with the blood it ſelf; which as it is of all other parts, ſo it is likewiſe the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the hairs, as we told above in the tenth Chapter. Which appeareth even from hence, that the hairs in the <hi>Plica,</hi> if at any time they be cut, they yield forth blood. That (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what hath been ſaid) there are now and then ſome certain perſons even in the neer neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Regions that are likewiſe troubled with this Diſeaſe, this may poſſibly proceed, either from the natural neer allied Genius of that place; or elſe from the Parents. For look as Arthritical perſons beget the like; ſo alſo it is not impoſſible, but that thoſe which are affected with the <hi>Plica</hi> may transfuſe into their Iſſue a vitious diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the generating of the ſame Diſeaſe; and Experience teacheth us the truth of this. The Son of the aforeſaid Lord, Count <hi>Sapieha,</hi> when he was ſix yeers of age, had at the firſt ſome few intangled Locks of hair among the hairs on his head; and the ſame hath alſo happened unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I knew a Souldier (an old man) that had a <hi>Plica</hi> in the hinder part of his Head; who being demanded as touching the Cauſe of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe (for he was a German and horn at <hi>Thurin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>) replied, that this Diſeaſe was hereditary unto him; for his Mother (as he ſaid) had ſeven of theſe <hi>Plica's,</hi> two Ells long, all her life long, even unto her dying day. The ſame Man related this likewiſe for a truth, that being a Souldier in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and taken priſoner by the Turks, his Maſter (according to the cuſtom of that Nation) cauſed all his hair, and withall this <hi>Plica</hi> of his, to be cut off; and that he thereupon became blind: but that having by an Interpreter, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Maſter with the Cauſe of this his blindneſs, and obtained of him that his hair might be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to grow forth again, he afterward recovered his ſight.</p>

                        <head>The Cure.</head>
                        <p>I conceive that the perfect Cure of this Diſeaſe is altogether unknown. Which without doubt proceedeth from this, that in thoſe places of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> where this diſeaſe is Epidemical, there have hitherto lived but very few Phyſitians that were able to compoſe an artificial Method out of thoſe things they might come to know from the vulgar, touching this Diſeaſe, and the Cure thereof.</p>
                        <p>This in the firſt place is certain, That Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and letting blood avail but little in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; yea, that they are oftentimes hurtful. For ſo the Rector of the Univerſity of <hi>Zamoſcium</hi> writeth unto the Phyſitians of <hi>Padua: If we attempt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to cure this Diſeaſe with the uſual Purgations, it maketh it but ſo much the worſe, and to rage ſo much the more; in regard that the Purgation is not able to overcome and maſter the noxious humors, but only to diſperſe them throughout the whol body when they are thus moved: for thoſe that are affected with this peſtilent Diſeaſe do thereupon burn with ſo great a pain of al their Members, that nothing more ſharp can poſſibly be added unto the ſharpneſs and bitterneſs of their torments.</hi> And the ſame is confirmed by <hi>Hercules Saxonia,</hi> who in the place alleadged, out of the Epiſtle of a certain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Matron, a Polonian (who was troubled with this Diſeaſe) writeth, That the ſaid Matron up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the opening of a Vein in the Arm, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately taken with moſt extream and intollerable pains in the ſame Arm, together with oedema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Tumor: and likewiſe that for the very ſame reaſon, a Vein being opened in the Feet, there were moſt ſharp and bitter pains excited in both her Thighs, as low as the Ankles. The ſanne <hi>Hercules Saxonia</hi> in the ſame place, writeth, That a certain famous and eminent Captain, a Polonian (<hi>Joachimus de Ocieſno</hi> by name) told him, that he had ſeen many that were blind, and ſome that were lame, and others other wiſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, who having had Purgations adminiſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in the beginning, fel into theſe Affects. And the very ſame happeneth alſo in the Scurvy; the Symptoms whereof are for the moſt part exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated by the uſe of Purgets.</p>
                        <p>It wil therefore be the ſafeſt courſe (ſtil ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Experience for our Guide) to uſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our endeavor that the ſaid vitious matter may with al poſſible ſpeed be drawn forth unto the hairs, whither it is now tending. In which it wil be likewiſe our ſafeſt courſe again to follow the guidance of Experience; by which it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appeareth, that thoſe Lotions that are made of the Plant we commonly cal Beats-breech, is very available and ſucceſsful in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs indeed it is altogether unknown unto me, whether the ſame may be performed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Medicaments. But yet the very mentioning of Bears-breech brings unto my remembrance a certain Drink (no doubt at the firſt brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>Polonia</hi>) that was much in uſe in my Country, in the City <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ratiſlavia,</hi> and it is made of Bears-breech: the vulgar cal it by the common Polonian name <hi>Barſiez,</hi> or as the Germans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it <hi>Barkech;</hi> which thoſe that are Feaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and eſpecially the great Drinkers after their exceſſive Cups the day before, uſe in their broths, and in their ordinary Drink, to aſſwage their chirſt. Now it is made in this manner.

And it is their part who live in thoſe places to make publick thoſe Medicaments that uſe hath taught them to be fit and profitable, that ſo al their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences being conferr'd together, there may at the length be compoſed a Method of Curing this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>

It ſeemeth therefore unto me, that this illuſtrious Lord is diſaffected with a twofold kind of Diſeaſes; the one of them moſt manifeſt, depending upon Cauſes that are commonly known and confeſſed: the other occult and ſecret, the Cauſes whereof are as yet obſcure; neither ſeem they hitherto to be ſufficiently expreſſed by any. There is manifeſtly appearing a Catarrh of matter that is thick, tenacious, white, oftentimes inſipid and taſtleſs (and very rarely ſharp and biting) flowing and falling down unto the parts of the mouth, and ſomtimes alſo unto the ſtomack. There is moreover an exetraordinary pain of the lower belly, returning afreſh after long intervals and Caſſations, with an aſtriction and coſtiveneſs of the belly, and a certain grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and painful ſenſe of extenſion and ſtretching about the Region of the Navel, of the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, eſpecially the left, and ſomtimes alſo of the Loyns; which indeed is wont in great part to ceaſe upon the plentiful Evacuation of the Wind, and a ſnotty kind of Excrement that comes from him. To theſe we may add the Nephritick diſtemper, and want of reſt and ſleep; this latter being indeed very familiar and frequent with him, for he uſually paſſeth many whol nights together without ſleep; and the former, to wit, the diſtemper of the Kidneys, hath now of a long time ſorely troubled him, with a redneſs and heat of his Urine, and excretion of ſand and gravel with his water. The cauſes of al which Maladies it is moſt manifeſt that they are derived from the evil conſtitution of the internal Bowels, and the excrements of ſeveral ſorts from thence ariſing.

So that the flegm heaped up in the head partly by its great plenty, and its own weight, maketh it ſelf a way and paſſage unto the parts lying underneath; and partly thruſt forth by the ſtrength and act of the expulſive faculty it ruſheth unto the mouth and ſtomach, looſeneth the teeth in the Gums, and beſides exciteth and cauſeth very much trouble and pain in the ſwallowing. The ſame (being much encreaſed in the ſtomach, by reaſon, of its own proper diſtemper) cauſeth in him the loſs of his Appertite; and from the agitation and weakneſs of the heart it produceth extream windineſs; as alſo a pain of the Inteſtines, with a Coſtiveneſs of the belly, by reaſon eſpecially of the hindered contraction of the tranſverſe fibres diſtended by windineſs, by which ſaid Contraction the deſcent of the Dreggs is very much furthered.

Simply occult is that Witchcraft, of which this illuſtrious perſon hath very rational and probable grounds to ſuſpect that it hath been practiſed upon him; in regard that (as he relateth) there have been often found in his bed ſtrange and admirable Magical Figures, of Bones, of Wax, and of other matter; as alſo ſuch like Signs and Characters as Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Wizards are wont to abuſe in deſtroying thoſe they bewitch: and in regard likewiſe that he had moſt powerful and moſt implacable Enemies, by whom he doubteth not but that his ruine and deſtruction hath by al kinds of wiles, wicked arts, and inventions, been attempted. Since therefore it is confeſſed by al that by Witchcraft bodies may in a various manner be changed; and that thereby there often happen the very ſame effects that are wont to follow likewiſe upon the natural motions of the humor in the body ill affected; hence it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if haply any one ſhal object and ſay, That the aforeſaid doubt is altogether needleſs and impertinent, ſince that al thoſe Accidents that the Patient ſuffereth may very wel be referred unto the various, and thoſe likewiſe ſufficiently manifeſt vices of the humors; let ſuch a one know, that ſuch as are variouſly affected from a ſupernatural Cauſe, although the effects proceeding therefrom may ſeem to be natural; yet notwithſtanding they cannot by the aid and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Phyſitians ſo eaſily be corrected and kept under, as thoſe may that are vitiated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their depraved power and violence from ſome Natural and ſenſible Cauſe: ſo that, albeit the knowledg of Witchcraft maketh not much for the attaining of the next and immediate Cauſe of the Diſeaſe; yet nevertheleſs it helpeth very much in foretelling the facility of the Cure, and preſaging the iſſue and event of the Diſeaſe. I would to God that this noble perſon were altogether free from this infection; which doth indeed render the Cure of the Diſeaſe moſt pertinacious in al reſpects, and moſt intricate and difficult. But there are two other occult Maladies, with the which I plainly affirm that this noble perſon is affected, to wit, the Scurvey, and the <hi>Plica;</hi> the Nature of which Maladies as it is abſtruſe, and hitherunto never ſufficiently demonſtrated by any, ſo the accidents therein happening are moſt manifeſt. And in very deed (that ſo for brevities ſake I may paſs over the many other notes and ſigns) al men generally acknowledg and confeſs, that the <hi>Plica</hi> ariſeth from the inexplicable and intangled Locks of the Hair; but yet they are altogether ignorant of the proper Cauſe thereof, although they ſpeak ſomwhat that is probable touching the common Cauſe which yet nevertheleſs cannot be ſufficient for the conſtituting of the perfect Cure of the ſaid Malady. But certain it is, that their hairs are conglutinated, frizled, and entwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2636" facs="tcp:49110:130"/> reſtrained and kept in by the cutting off the hair, the Air more freely getting into the ſaid open pores, there enſue thereupon moſt grievous Accidents. It is alſo certain that by the drinking of vitious Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or elſe from exhalations mingled together with the Air, after a long abode and continuance therein, this Malady may at length be contracted; and therefore it is that this evil is almoſt Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal unto the Inhabitants of thoſe places that abound ſo much with theſe like Fountains and Rivers that are ſo wel known unto this noble perſon. Neither can it be doubted, that ſuch as have weaker heads, are ſooner and more grievouſly infected. But of what kind that excrement is, and with what poyſon infected, that ſeemeth a thing altogether occult and hidden; as likewiſe for what reaſon it doth infeſt the head rather than any other parts; and why in tract of time it vaniſheth of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, but yet wil not in the leaſt yield unto thoſe Remedies that cal it forth, and ſuch as we cal <hi>Alexipharmaca</hi> or Counterpoyſons; and laſtly, from whence it obtaineth that notable and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be admired power of Conglutinating. For neither can theſe be referred unto the manifeſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of any one humor (the firſt or ſecond) although true it is, that according to the generating of theſe depraved humors more or leſs, the evil may poſſibly creep more or leſs, and be more or leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. This may wholly be ſaid (which is likewiſe uſual in the explaining of al other poyſons) that thoſe Waters, and the exhalations thereof are infected with a poyſon endued with this property that it is more annoying unto the head, is fixed more pertinaciouſly unto the root of the hairs, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them together moſt ſtrongly, and wonderfully writheth them, and moſt obſtinately reſiſteth all kind of Remedies whatſoever, by reaſon that the peculiar nature and generation of this poyſon is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unknown, inſomuch that this Noble man ſeemed to have ſaid but the very truth unto me, that ſome Boors there were within his Territories that had diſcovered more of the original of <hi>Plica,</hi> as alſo of the progreſs, and Cure thereof, than thoſe Authors that had written concerning the ſame; none of which have as yet been ſo ſucceſsful, as to reſtore unto perfect health any one that hath been afflicted with this <hi>Plica.</hi> But for the Scurvy it is to be eſteemed a far more grievous Malady, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it creepeth into the whol blood; and the corruption thereof prevailing and getting ſtrength may at length cauſe death unto the party therewith affected; which the <hi>Plica</hi> if let alone without cure, and not medled withal, never yet did unto any. So that this Noble perſon is not without good cauſe very much perplexed and troubled as touching this his Malady, being in good earneſt grieved, that there is hardly any regard had unto this Affect in this City; where there hath ſcarcely ever yet been ſeen (at any time) any one infected with the Scurvy. And I (for my own part) although I have ſeen two Hollanders and one Engliſh man (both at <hi>Venice,</hi> and at <hi>Padua</hi> alſo) al three of them affected with an exquiſite Scurvy, yet I neither expect nor deſire that any Credit ſhould be given unto what I ſay; but yet notwithſtanding from what I find written touching the Scurvy by <hi>Foreſtus, Eugalenus,</hi> and <hi>Sennertus,</hi> moſt truly, and according to what they had ſeen, and found atteſted by many Hiſtories, I ſhal preſume (and that very confidently) to affirm that this illuſtrious Lord is at preſent much afflicted with the Scurvy. For excepting only the ſwelling of the Lips, and the flaggineſs of the putrid Gums (the Accidents of the Scurvy confirmed) al other ſigns and tokens of the Scurvy are preſent; to wit, the much and long uſe in former time of ſalted and ſmoke-dried fleſh, unto which the Soldiery in the Septentrional parts are extreamly addicted; add unto this the looſneſs of the Teeth, with ſome kind of itching in the Gums; the continual great laſſitude and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs of the parts, and eſpecially of the internal; the extenſion of the left <hi>Hypochondrium,</hi> and the Meſentery; and the broad Effloreſcencies, one while wan, and other whiles red, budding forth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually here and there throughout the whol body without any Feaver; which is conceived to be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thognomick Symptom of the Scurvy. Unto this we may add, that this illuſtrious perſon about ſome three yeers ſince was apparently affected with the Scurvy, and that the Phyſitian who then had him in cure (being moſt expert in the knowledg of the Scurvy) told him plainly and freely at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the reliques and remainders of the Scurvy were not in the leaſt to be ſleighted by him, but upon al occaſions opportunely to be prevented. But perhaps the Italian Phyſitians do therefore ſleight and but little account of the name of the Scurvy, in regard that they are of opinion that al the aforeſaid accidents may be al of them referred unto thoſe cauſes that are evident, and not called by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual names, and ſuch as in former times were not ſo much as ever heard of. For the redundance of the aduſt Melancholy which is much defiled with Ichores and thin Excrements (which ſaid redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Melancholy and other the ſaid humors, that they are at preſent to be found in this illuſtrious Lord, is manifeſtly ſhewn by the boyling heat of his Liver, the weakneſs of the Spleen, the familiar flux of the Haemorrhoids, and the frequent uſe of meats ſalt and earthy) may poſſibly breed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a laſſitude, and litherneſs, but more eſpecially in the internal parts, unto which the humor by its weight and heavineſs naturally tendeth. Unto al this it may be added that it much impaireth the ſtrength and natural powers, enervates and weakens the body, and extenuateth the ſame by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Aliment; it extendeth likewiſe the Natural Bowels by its great plenty and thickneſs, and obſtructeth the ſame by the admixture of the diffuſed Ichorous Excrements with the overhot blood. Neither are we at al to wonder that various ſpots ariſe, ſince that both by its own proper thinneſs that
<pb n="2637" facs="tcp:49110:130"/> more hot part of the aduſt humor is eaſily carried forth unto the outſide of the body; and that (the expulſive faculty of the internal Bowels being irritated) it is no hard matter for it to be purged forth through the looſe skin, being porous and weak. And therefore to me there ſeemeth to be no cauſe why we ſhould abuſe the new and unuſual name of the Scurvy in the explaining of things ſo wel known. But how many ſick perſons have been moſt miſerably caſt away through this kind of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we may every where read in thoſe Authors that have written touching the Scurvy; who all of them with one conſent affirm, that never any yet being affected with the Scurvy, and having had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto him only theſe remedies that have acted by a manifeſt quality, and ſuch as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to evacuate and temper Melancholy aduſt, and to take away the obſtructions of the Bowels (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though adminiſtred by the moſt able and expert Phyſitians) was thereby perfectly cured; in regard that the Melancholy blood (in this Diſeaſe) contracteth a corruption peculiar, and ſuch as cannon wel be expreſſed; which ought to be removed and taken away by thoſe Alexipharmaca that are fit and proper for it, and that otherwiſe irritate and enrage aduſt Melancholy, if we regard the manifeſt qualities. For Spoonwort, or Scurvy-graſs, Water Pimpernel, and certain kinds of the Creſſes and Water Parſley (al of them being moſt ſharp, and unto which alone the Scurvy giveth place) ſeeing that they attain unto the third degree of heat, and greatly dry, they would vehemently increaſe the vices of the aduſt Melancholy, and al the cauſes thereof, unleſs by their Alexipharmick quality they oppoſed the corruption of the Scorbutick blood. And that the ſaid effloreſcency of the ſpots in the Skin are the Concomitant of this Corruption, wil be demonſtrated even by this, That in thoſe other Meridional Regions, in the which aduſt humors do oftentimes ſway and reign, ſuch like effloreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies do not at al appear without a Feaver. Seeing that therefore the name of the Scurvy deſigneth and pointeth out unto us ſomthing that may be uſeful in the Cure thereof, it is by no means to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, as unuſual and altogether unheard of by the Ancient Phyſitians, unto whom the name of <hi>Plica,</hi> of the French Diſeaſe, and the Meaſels, was alike unknown. Now if this be ſo, this illuſtrious perſon may very wel conceive ſome hope of the recovery of his health (in regard of his Catarrh, pain of his belly, and want of his reſt) from the help and aſſiſtance of the Italian Remedies: but I muſt profeſs that I underſtand not what is likely to do him any good in the Cure of <hi>Plica</hi> and the Scurvy wherewith he is alſo affected. The Remedy of the <hi>Plica</hi> is altogether unknown; and this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon knoweth, that hitherto there was never any yet (either here or elſewhere) perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of this Malady by the help of the Phyſitians though never ſo able. And what this noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath ſmal hopes to expect from Phyſitians, he may perhaps within four or five yeers attain by the benefit of Nature; ſince that it hath been obſerved, that men grown have in the fourteenth or ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeer been wholly freed from it, the <hi>Plica</hi> falling off of its own accord, and never after more appearing. But <hi>Italy</hi> wanteth <hi>Alexipharmaca</hi> for the Scurvy, into which if any chance to be brought, they wil hardly be preſerved above one yeer. What is therefore to be done in this Caſe? This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to wit, That (for very good reaſon) he perſiſt in the Cure as it is already begun (which may corroborate the Stomach, dry the Head, and draw forth unto the outward parts the virulent excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Plica,</hi> by the help of a Decoction, and the external uſe of Bath-waters, as alſo by the dropping of hot Oyls upon the ſtomach) until the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> if at leaſt he be able ſo long to endure and bear the ſtrength of theſe extraordinary drying Medicaments. But then let him wholly apply himſelf unto the Cure of the Scurvy; that is to ſay, let him uſe the Decoctions of the opening Herbs, mingling therewith that quantity of the Alexipharmaca that the Phyſitian wel exerciſed in this kind of Cure ſhal judg fit and convenient. But in the general, the cure of the Scurvy is more eſpecially to conſiſt in this, That thoſe things that open obſtructions (the choice whereof is to be left unto the judgment of the Phyſitian that hath undertaken the Cure) are evermore to be tempered together with the Antiſcorbutick Remedies. For which cauſe I judg it fit and very requiſite that the Patient with al poſſible ſpeed make a Journey into the Northern parts, that ſo he may find the Herbs yet flouriſhing, and ful of juyce. For the general opinion is, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcorbutick Herbs benefit more by their Juyce than by their Decoction, or any other way whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Lee him have recourſe unto <hi>Daniel Sennertus,</hi> the moſt eminent and famous Phyſitian of our Age, and one moſt exerciſed in the knowledg and Cure of the Scurvy: let him wholly commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto his Care, and be ruled by his advice, and in ſo doing (next under God) let him expect his recovery from this moſt dangerous Malady from him alone. He liveth at <hi>Witteberg,</hi> where the Antidotes againſt the Scurvy are known very familiarly. Now if ſo be that before Winter he ſhal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him again to make uſe of the Hydrotick Decoction for the Head, (for the ſtrengthening of the head, and belly, and the drawing forth of al thick excrements whatever) this I judg to be very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and conducing unto the haſtening on of the ſpontaneous and voluntary Cure ot the <hi>Plica.</hi> His Liver though it ſeem to be extreamly hot, and to require extraordinary cooling Medicaments, yet notwithſtanding it wil be far more ſafe in the hot Summer time to uſe a cooling Diet, than any cooling Medicaments: for the Stomach being but weak and fleſhleſs by the uſe of theſe ſaid Medicaments may eaſily be deſtroyed; and it is likewiſe obſerved that the <hi>Plica</hi> is but the more enraged by the uſe of
<pb n="2638" facs="tcp:49110:131"/> refrigerating Medicaments. And this (moſt Excellent and Illuſtrious Doctor, and my very good Friend) is that which I thought fit to write back unto you, for the ſatisfying of your requeſt. I have purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forborn the mentioning of the Remedies, in regard that all ſuch as were to be taken in <hi>Italy</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been moſt prudently preſcribed unto the moſt Illuſtrious Patient, and to my knowledg have continually been made uſe of, and without any, or very little change made therein, continually pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by him: and as for ſuch as ſhal henceforward be preſcribed for him (in <hi>Saxony</hi> or elſwhere) for the Cure of his Scurvy (the State and Condition in which this Illuſtrious Perſon ſhall then be found to be after all the toyl of his Journies being firſt throughly diſcovered, and a triall made of the Cure yet further to be continued) they are in a various manner to be accommodated unto the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his body; neither may they indeed (without much arrogance) be ſo much as hinted unto one ſo expert as your ſelf.

But when his Kinred and Friends (by reaſon of ſo great weakneſs of his body diſſwaded him from the Journey, as thinking that he would never come hither alive, he deferred his Journey until the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn following. But when he perceived his Diſeaſe daily to encreaſe upon him, he at length provides himſelf for his Journey; and in the month of <hi>November</hi> the ſame yeer, being carried in a Horſ-litter he took his Journey through <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> and <hi>Sileſia</hi> (about a hundred German miles) and came hitherunto me at <hi>Witteberg,</hi> but almoſt half dead. For he hung together (as it were) only by Skin and Bones; being not able to move Hand or Foot, no not ſo much as his Head. But I had rather relate the Hiſtory of his State &amp; Diſeaſe in the Words of his Domeſtick Phyſitian, which he had brought along with him out of <hi>Italy</hi> (that famous and Eminent man, Dr. <hi>Franciſcus Miſtruccius,</hi> Doctor of Phyſick at <hi>Forojulium</hi>) then mine own; who gave me an account of the Diſeaſe of this noble Lord, deſcribing it in the manner following.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Among thoſe many remarkable and famous things wherein Antiquity flouriſhed, and was of old much admired for, this Cuſtom of theirs (moſt excellent Doctor) was evermore held to be one of the moſt famous and laudable, that they made Journeys ſomtimes as far as unto</hi> Delphos, <hi>that they might there receive an anſwer in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Caſes from the Oracle of</hi> Apollo Pythius, <hi>an Oracle much fam'd all the World over. After the manner of theſe Ancients this Generous and moſt Illuſtrious Count, my Lord</hi> Nicholaus Sapieha, <hi>Standard bearer General of the great Dukedom of</hi> Lituania, <hi>Careful as he is for his own ſafety &amp; preſervation after trial made of ſo many and ſo various Medicaments, after ſo many Anſwers received both in his own Country</hi> Polonia, <hi>&amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in</hi> Italy, <hi>hath at length arrived now at this time hereat</hi> Witteberg (<hi>no</hi> Delphos <hi>I confeſs, but in very truth another</hi> Athens) <hi>that he may now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with you, I had almoſt ſaid, the moſt wiſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Phyſick; and expecting from you the utmoſt of your aſſiſtance, which he earneſtly imploreth &amp; expecteth, and you have ever out of humanity afforded it unto any. And (ſince it is a task impoſed upon me) I wil very briefly indeed, and yet notwithſtanding diſtinctly, relate the Hiſtory of this Noble Perſon; his Affects and as for thoſe few remedies that I ſhal cal to mind, for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val and overmaſtering of this kind of Malady, I ſhal preſcribe them with that modeſty that becomes me; and yet nevertheleſs referring otherwiſe al unto your moſt quick apprehenſion, and accurate Judgment (as unto a Lydian ſtone) for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poliſhing and adorning thereof.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The principal Affect touching which this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord is ſo greatly ſollicitous (as of that which hath twice or thrice threatned even Death at the door) is the long laſting and cruel pain of all the lower Belly, having its reſidence one while in the right, and another while in the left</hi> Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drium, <hi>and as ſoon again about the Navel. This is now the ſeventh yeer, ſince that theſe fierce and cruel pains and torments have had their recour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; which have been ſo pertinacious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yielding, that (let me freely ſpeak it) they have now almoſt driven both the Patient and the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian likewiſe even to deſperation; ſo far have theſe torturings hitherto been from yielding unto any Medicament. There is now a yeer and a half paſt ſince that I was added unto thoſe that had this Noble Perſon in Cure; in which time only I ſhal acquaint you what the quality of the Diſeaſe hath been, that ſo there may be no vain repetition of what went before, all things in a manner keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it was related unto me) the very ſame Courſe and Tenour at all times. And therefore (that we may ſpeak ſomething of what happened in that ſpace of time) the Caſe in a manner ſtood thus. In the month of</hi> July <hi>out of</hi> Italy <hi>we came to</hi> Cracovia, <hi>where this Illuſtrious Lord had at that very time committed himſelf unto the care of a certain Phyſitian that profeſſed the Curing of
<pb n="2639" facs="tcp:49110:131"/> Scurvy; who without due reſpect had unto the Counſel of</hi> Hippocrates <hi>(to wit, that before the Dog-ſtar, and during the time thereof, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges work not kindly, but are rough and harſh) and not at all regarding, that this Noble Lord ſtood at that time in more need of reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (by reaſon of the many diſcommodities he underwent in his long and tedious Journey) then of any new agitation and diſturbance of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, began to adminiſter unto him thoſe ſame Scorbutick Medicaments, to wit, the Syrup of Spoonwort or Scurvygraſs, the Juyce of the ſame Herb, and other things of the ſame rank and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; adding thereto ſome certain Pouders and Potions that were purging; in which ſaid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments this Phyſitian perſiſted for ſix whole weeks together, without any apparent benefit at all. But at length his moſt Illuſtrious Lord ſeeing that he was not like to get any good from him, began to think of his departure thence; and ſo about the end of</hi> Auguſt <hi>we came to</hi> Lublin; <hi>whither ſo ſoon as ever we were come, thoſe fierce and cruel torturing pains aſſaulted him all the lower Belly throughout, reaching even unto the Region of the Loyns; which would not admit of any the leaſt intermiſſion, untill after a long time, and many difficulties, and much drawing forth of the peccant humors; as likewiſe both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by the benefit of a ſpontaneous Vomit; and downwards alſo by the frequent uſe of Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, of a certain ſnotty Matter, white, inſipid, ſomtimes thin, bitter, yellow, and ſometimes duſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie; and alſo withall great ſtore of Wind: In which pain the Belly was ſo Coſtive, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Clyſters that were put up, although otherwiſe purging, would not be brought back again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty: the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine likewiſe that he made came from him red, and with much ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not without an extraordinary pain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Reins; which afterward (upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of the pain) flowed forth in greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and withal he voided much red Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. And ſo (the pain being aſſwaged) from</hi> Lublin <hi>we came to</hi> Codna, <hi>about the latter end of</hi> October; <hi>this</hi> Codna <hi>is a City of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. But ſhortly after our arrival there, the Obſtructions return, and the pains are renewed in their former heighth, with frequent ſwouning and fainting ſits (like as but a little before it had befallen him in his Journey) inſomuch that we wholly deſpaired of his life: in which his pains &amp; fainting ſits, although that by putting up of molle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Clyſters, and by the uſe of Evacuating Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies given him downward, his Belly was much opened and looſned, ſo that (even as was ſaid before) there were caſt forth Excrements of all ſorts, with ſome evident alleviation and eaſe; yet notwithſtanding the Diſeaſe returneth again with no leſs vehemency then before, other new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions ſtil ſucceding the former; neither hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto could the Diſeaſe be extirpated. Yea in the month of</hi> Auguſt <hi>laſt paſt, after the taking of a China Decoction, his Diſeaſe ſo far prevailed upon him for about the ſpace of fourty daies, and ſo miſerably was he tortured and wracked by his pains, that we could ſcarcely move him in his bed, he was almoſt ſpeechleſs, and could very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw his breath. And ſo in his Journey, in the midſt of his Coughing, his breathing was thrice ſo ſtopt and hindred, that we were altogether in fear that he would have been ſtrangled. But you muſt know moreover, that beſides thoſe intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pains that are felt in all the parts of his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; there are others likewiſe that are ſometimes extended throughout the whole Back, and unto the very utmoſt Joynts; but eſpecially they paſs along through unto the joynts of the Arms and Feet: yea in the journey aforeſaid, ſuch and ſo great were the pains that he felt about thoſe parts (after the torturing pains of his lower Belly) that the like thereunto he had never before felt in all his life: for (even as erewhile, you might likewiſe have obſerved, moſt Excellent Doctor) he could ſcarcely take any reſt, nor hardly ſtir Hand or Foot: unto which pains there at length followed a Palſey (not ſuch as is indeed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuall, and properly ſo called) of the Hands and Feet, with a pining away, and illfavoredneſs of all the Members, as appeared unto all the beholders. And it is likewiſe to be obſerved, that thoſe pains do now recurr more frequently then formerly in the yeers paſt. There is alſo adjoyned a Pruri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous or Itching yellowiſhneſs, and Excreſcence, of the Gumms, with certain red ſpots, like unto Flea-bitings, appearing more eſpecially in the Back and Thighes, which by degrees tending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pale and wan color at length wholly vaniſh. And although that the pains of the</hi> Abdomen <hi>do now and then intermit; yet nevertheleſs his lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtil continueth, as alſo the extraordinary Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude of his whol body; the Palſie in like manner ſtil perſiſteth, and the pain of the joynts, with ſuch and ſo great an aſtriction of the Belly, that he cannot (in truth) of himſelf void forth any the leaſt ſhew of excrement: and therefore we are fain often to provoke it, and put it forward with</hi> Aloes Roſat, <hi>and every other day with Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. But if the Evacuation be but for one day omitted, then to be ſure, his tormenting pains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn afreſh upon him. And wonderful it is to ſee, what abundance of Excrements of all ſorts (but eſpecially of Choler and ſnotty Flegm) he daily without fail voideth forth by the benefit of theſe Medicaments; and yet nevertheleſs his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſtil perſiſteth with al kind of Obſtinacy. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe aforeſaid purging Medicaments we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn likewiſe thoſe things that Corroborate; ſuch as, the Rolls of the Species of</hi> Aromaticum Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Diarrhodon Abbatis; <hi>and adding thereunto Corals and Margarites, the Confection of Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth, Alchermes, and other things of the ſame rank; and yet by all theſe means we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="2640" facs="tcp:49110:132"/> done him no good. But as for what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe doubts that by your Letters you ſignified unto me that I ſhould explain unto you (by looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the knots of them) thus it is, as far as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. As for that Haemorrhage which he had ſome four yeers ſince, it proceeded not from any debility of the Bowels; for after it he did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain recover his health in that meaſure that for almoſt a yeer and half before he had enjoyed it in</hi> Italy: <hi>neither yet from the retention of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids; for together with it the Haemorrhoids likewiſe had their Periods every month; which when (from the midſt of the yeer only) they altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intermitted, I was then conſtrained by Art to prvoke them three or four ſeveral times. It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth therfore that the ſaid Haemorrhage hath its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal from the acrimony &amp; thinneſs of the blood, which it contracteth from the Head extreamly overheated. And as for the</hi> Plica <hi>which he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth about with him in his Head, it firſt of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted it ſelf almoſt a yeer after the beginning of thoſe pains; neither is it hereditary; for none of his Stock before him ever had the like Affect. And as for the deſtillation from his Head, it hath continually been, and as yet abideth in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, even as it appeareth from thoſe things that are continually voided out of the Head, by the Noſethrils and Palate; the greateſt part whereof falleth down unto the Stomack, and from thence to the Inteſtines; from whenee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the aforementioned pains receive no ſmall part of their fuel, and that which continually feeds and foments them. The Pulſes (that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe are alwaies obſcure, with ſome kind of frequency) admit of a variation, according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Intenſeneſs or remiſsneſs of the pains. The order and Courſe of his Diet for the moſt part (eſpecially in the paroxyſm of his pains) hath been guided rather at the pleaſure of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, then by the Advice of the Phyſitian; of Culliſes, of Capons maſhed together, new Eggs potched and ſupt up, and Broths aromatized with all kind of Spices. He drinketh Italian Wine, of a good ſubſtance. He hath an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite ſo dejected and weak (eſpecially during the continuace of his pains) that even the very ſmel of Fleſh maketh him ready to caſt: He is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually thirſty, and thereupon he is very apt ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to exceed in the drinking of Wine. He paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth whole nights (for the moſt part) without ſleep; and if he chance at all to ſleep, that ſleep is altogether unquiet, and ful of Phantaſms.

                           </gap>aly <hi>how and in what manner this Noble Count hath been handled by Medicaments, you have now already ſeen al that can be written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame. Theſe therfore are thoſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that ſo fiercely and cruelly afflict this moſt Illuſtrious Perſon. From theſe (as far forth as it is poſſible) he deſireth to be freed. And if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver help and aſſiſtance be to he expected for huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſake; he in very truth (in theſe his ſo great miſeries and ſufferings) deſireth and expecteth this aſſiſtance from none other, but from your ſelf alone, next under God: I ſay from thee alone (moſt (Excellent, and Expert</hi> Sennertus) <hi>whom I ſee to flouriſh (like as a moſt fragrant Roſe in the moſt delightful Garden of Phyſick) among the thickeſt Brambles (as I may ſo call them) of theſe difficult Diſeaſes in the aforeſaid (Province of</hi> Saxony; <hi>and for my own part (I profeſs) I much admire thy Abilities.</hi> Thus far Dr. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus Miſtruccius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And with all theſe Maladies was this moſt Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Count continually afflicted. And the truth is, that which exceedingly troubled and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured him, was the irremovable Obſtruction of his Belly, which evermore continued, unleſs it were removed either by Clyſters, or Purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments. For the moving of his Belly, and the keeping of it open, he had brought along with him out of <hi>Italy</hi> a great quantity of <hi>Aloes Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat.</hi> But I well knowing that by the uſe thereof his Belly was dried much the more, diſſwaded him from continuing the Uſe of it. When he went to ſtool he then voided Flegm (Viſcid, Clammy, and very Tenacious) in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. And withall at that ſame time he was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually infeſted by thoſe moſt grievous and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable pains in the Belly, which were moſt an end terminated in the pains of the Joynts; as for the moſt part theſe likewiſe again ended in thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. But if it ſo chanced that upon the invaſion of theſe Belly pains he were taken with any great Vomiting (which very often happened) his pains were then the more moderate, and did the ſooner remit. There was moreover preſent a Palſie of all the Members, as likewiſe of the Tongue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, ſo that he faltered there in, and could not ſpeak diſtinctly. And yet notwithſtanding, thoſe moſt grievous pains of the Joynts (with a certain kind of Swelling) accompanied the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, as we have already ſaid. At certain time alſo (by intervals) he was infeſted by a Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom that greatly terrified him, to wit, a fear of ſuffocation, and a certain ſtrangling as it were (of which we have already made mention in Chap. 4. touching the Scurvy) which proceeded from a Styptick Vapor contracting the Muſcles, moving the Larynx, and as it were violently pulling them together. In the Body (the Back eſpecially) there appeared wan ſpots; the Teeth were looſe, and indeed ſome of them were already faln out. There was likewiſe continually to be ſeen in the hollow of his Hands a perpetuall redneſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding (no doubt) from the heat and drineſs of the Liver; and this aroſe from the unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe of Medicaments heating and drying. For he had not only for fourty daies together uſed the Decoction of China (as is beforeſaid) but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medicaments of the like Nature. He lay whole Nights (many times) without any ſleep at all. There was likewiſe preſent a Fever, that
<pb n="2641" facs="tcp:49110:132"/> obſerved no courſe at al, ſuch as thoſe are wont to be that accompany the Scurvy. Such was this Patient when I firſt received him, that for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his perfect health I could give him no aſſurance at al; neither could I wel give him any certain hope of the preſerving his life from a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death, which continually threatened him. But yet nevertheleſs in regard that he had come ſo far a Journey for his healths ſake, I endeavored (what I could) by my continued care and pains to effect his deſire, and to do him good; and by the good hand of the Almighty aſſiſting me I ſo wrought, that his Belly was able again to do its office; and that the excrements acquited again their natural conſiſtence; that the pains of the Belly and Joynts ceaſed; and that the Arms and the Hands had likewiſe their motion reſtored them; inſomuch that the Noble Lord could not only perform other offices with his Arms and Hands, but could likewiſe write Letters. His Belly alſo that was altogether extenuated began again to increaſe, and not only ſo, but even alſo to grow fat again.</p>
                        <p>And yet notwithſtanding there ſtil remained and pertinaciouſly perſevered the Palſey of the Feet, and their contraction; which could not be taken away by any kind of Medicaments, no not by the uſe of thoſe admirable Baths (to wit, the <hi>Teplicenſes</hi>) into which he was put, in the month of <hi>June,</hi> in the yeer 1629. and as I conceive, it wil hardly ever be wholly and perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                        <p>Now the Medicaments that I made uſe of were directed unto theſe ends and purpoſes; to wit, that the Belly might again be made looſe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble; that the Cacochymy might by degrees be evacuated; that the vice of the humors, and the Scorbutick diſpoſition of the Bowels might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Antiſcorbutick Medicaments; and that the moſt urgent Symptoms might be quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and taken away.</p>
                        <p>As for what concerns the matter of Phyſick; here to ſet down al the forms of thoſe Medicaments which almoſt every day were adminiſtred, it would be too tedious, and not worth the while; in regard that the ſame Indications ſtil abiding, the very ſame Medicaments (but yet nevertheleſs with often variation of the forms) are frequently to be repeated in this long laſting and contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſeaſe. We wil therefore only ſubjoyn the matter of thoſe Medicaments that anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Indications, extracted from the forms: which yet nevertheleſs were not al of them admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in al Medicaments, but according unto the preſent condition, and the Nature of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſomtimes theſe, and then another while thoſe were adminiſtred. And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we wil here add a form or two. For the looſening of his Belly (which unleſs ſome waies irritated would ſcarcely ever have done its office) he had indeed, as I told you before, brought out of <hi>Italy</hi> great ſtore of Aloes Roſat. But when I perceived that by the uſe thereof his Inteſtines were but the more dried, I diſſwaded him from the uſe of it. And ſo inſtead thereof he often made uſe of Clyſters (unto the which his body had been much accuſtomed) made of the Roots of Marſh-mallows, Polypody of the Oak, the Leaves of Feverfew, of the Herb Mercury, Bears-breech, Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Centaury the leſs; the flowers of Camomile, and Elder; Dill-ſeed, Fenugreek ſeed, Lin-ſeed, Cummin-ſeed; Electuar.

                        <p>But the Laxative Syrups were made of the Roots of Polypody of the Oak, Fern, Succory, the Rinds of Tamariſque, the Roots of Capars, Fumitory, Agrimony, Endive, Germander, Spleen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort or Miltwaſte; the ſeeds of Carthamus, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins; Leaves of Sene, Agarick, Zedoary, Galangal; the Rinds of Citron; the Cordial flowers, Manna, Cream of Tartar, and Sugar; as much of al theſe as ſhal ſuffice.</p>

                        <p>For the correcting the vice of the humors, and the amending of the Scorbutick diſpoſition, he made uſe of Antiſcorbutick and opening Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As for example,</p>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Scorbutick Water (deſcribed in the third Book of our Practice) four ounces, of Spoonwort or Scurvygraſs, and Borrage, of each one ounce; Conſerve of Spoonwort an ounce and half; of Betony half an ounce: Let them ſtand al night, and ſtrain them in the morning; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto of Tartar and Vitriol, or the ſimple mixture, of each half a dram, and mingle them together.</hi> Alſo,</p>

                        <p>And at length when I had once gotten the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Spoonwort from that moſt induſtrious Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary of <hi>Gorlicum, Johan.

                        <p>And likewiſe that we might provide for the ſafety of the Spleen (which at this time was very far amiſs) we cauſed an Emplaſter to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spleen.</p>
                        <p>The pains of the Belly and the Joynts took place (as it were) by turns, and reciprocally; ſo that when the pains of the belly remitted, then the pains of the Joynts began; and ſo on the contrary, when the pain of the Joynts ceaſed, then thoſe of the Belly began to diſquiet the Patient: and both of them were (for the moſt part) much modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when he plentifully (which very often ſo happened) caſt forth the tart, ſalt, and bitter hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, in an almoſt incredible abundance.</p>
                        <p>For the mitigation of the pains of his Belly, there were preſcribed Clyſters, of Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Camomile, Fenugreek ſeed, Dil ſeed, Lin-ſeed, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Oyl of Dil, Oyl of Camomile, Honey of Roſes, Oyl of Bayberries: and unto the Belly there were laid both Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Cataplaſms of the ſame and the like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments; and the Emplaſter of Lawrel Berries. He uſed likewiſe the Decoction of the flowers of Camomile with Manna, and the Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</p>
                        <p>For the pains of the Joynts in the Hands and Feet there were uſed Fomentations and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms, of the Roots of Marſh-mallows, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Camomile, and St. Johns wort, Wormwood, Betony, Water-Creſſes, flour of Lin-ſeed, and Fenugreek ſeed, Earthworms, Oyl of Elder, Oyl of Camomile, and the Unguent Dialthaea.</p>

                     <p>FIrſt of al, if the Nails have their own Natural Conſtitution, like as other parts of the body, they are then ſmooth and plain, and they have a color white and red, and a due and meet hardneſs and thickneſs: if this their Natural Conſtitution be changed, it fals then under the Nature of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>

                        <p>And firſt of al, indeed the Nails are ſomtimes unequal, and become thick and rugged. Which happeneth from the juyce by which the Nails are nouriſhed, abundantly flowing thereunto. For then they are not only made long, but they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe become thick, unequal, and rugged.

                        <p>This Vice is generated from the vitious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humors mingling themſelves with the aliment of the Nails. Now thoſe humors are more eſpecially Melancholick, which is ſhewn e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the color it ſelf of the Nails, they having in them ſomthing of Tartar, from whence the ſaid hardneſs proceedeth.</p>

                        <p>This Vice is cured, if what cannot be amended be by degrees pared away, and the excrementitious humor diſcuſſed.

                        <p>But ſomtimes only the color of the Nails is vitiated; ſo that they become leaden colored, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and black. Which Vice happeneth nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reaſon of the change of the color of the fleſh lying underneath (as ſome have thought) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the very aliment of the Nails is vitious, and endued with ſuch a color. And now and then likewiſe the Nails ar here and there marked wi h certain ſmal white ſpots (eſpecially in the younger ſort of people) which ariſing for the moſt part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Roots of them, together with the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nail they change their place; until at the length they are pared off with the Nail; and they have their original from the thick juyce that min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth it ſelf with the aliment.</p>
                        <p>In Curriers alſo (by reaſon of their handling of Lime and Ley) and in Dyers (by means of their handling their Dying ſtuff) the Natural color of the Nails is frequently changed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which oftentimes laſteth and continueth long.</p>
                        <p>This Vice indeed bringeth with it no danger at al; but yet it cauſeth a deformity, and is very offenſive and troubleſom unto Men, but eſpecially unto Women.</p>
                        <p>But now that this Vice may be taken away, the vitious humors (if they lie hid in the whol body) are to be evacuated; and then after they are to be taken away out of the Nails themſelves. This may be done, if the new growing nails be very often pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, until al that is viciated be quite taken away. And unto the Nail it ſelf that Emplaſter that ere while we mentioned (in the <hi>Lepra</hi> of the <hi>Nails</hi>) is to be applied.</p>
                        <p>But there is then a peculiar change of the color of the Nails, when by reaſon of a Contuſion there is blood ſhed forth under the Nail; and when ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the Nail it produceth a red or a blackiſh color, as it is wont to happen in Suffuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Which if it chance, <hi>Avicen</hi> adviſeth to make a hole through the ſame, and ſo to let out the blood that lieth underneath the Nail. And yet nevertheleſs, there is in thus doing great care to be had, leſt that in the perforation the nervous skin lying underneath be hurt, and ſo a pain be thereby excited.

                        <p>This is not unuſual (eſpecially in the Feet) that the Nails grow forth too much at the ſides, and make a hole through the skin lying under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath; upon which the fleſh there in that place beginneth to grow luxuriant, and to become proud, and proveth a very great impediment, both in putting on of the ſhoos, and alſo in going.

                        <p>And at length alſo the Nails are wont to fal off, leaving the extream part of the Finger quite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: which Vice may not unfitly be referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Diſeaſes in the number; ſince that without cauſe the Nails are excluded from the Number of the parts, notwithſtanding that they have their Natural conformity and uſe, and are nouriſhed like as other parts are, and cohere (as al other parts likewiſe do) unto the whole. But why the Nails fal away, this firſt of all and principally proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the fault of the Aliment; which when it declineth into another Nature, and ſo indeed that the Aliment is not only become ſimply viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (the ſame that happeneth likewiſe in the ruggedneſs and roughneſs of the Nails) but that it is alſo ſharp withal, and corrodeth the roots of the Nails (in the very ſame manner as the roots of the hairs are wont to be gnawn aſunder in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopecia, Ophiaſis,</hi> and ſhedding of the hair) the Nails then fall off. And ſo very often after Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Wounds about the roots of the Nails, the Nails are wont to fal off, <hi>Pus</hi> or filthy matter gnawing aſunder the roots of them. And when the roots of the Nails are eaten aſunder by the ſaid purulent matter, although the Nails do not then fal off of their own accord, yet by the Nail new growing they are thruſt off. And ſo it is found that after peſtilent and Malignant Fevers, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hairs have ſhed, but the Nails likewiſe have fallen off: and this hath likewiſe been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to happen after the drinking of Poyſon, and in the French Diſeaſe. And moreover, the very ſame may likewiſe happen from the want of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; like as we have ſeen and found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſuch as have travelled in the Snow, and that have held their hands long in cold water, have had their Nails fal off, either from a Conſtipation of the Pores of the hands that carry the Aliment unto the Nails, or elſe from the extinguiſhing of their Native heat.</p>
                        <p>Now this Vice (which is obvious unto the ſight) doth not only cauſe a deformity, but likewiſe hurteth the laying hold on any thing, for which the Nails ſerve: and moreover (in regard that the Nails do as it were defend the Fingers ends againſt external injuries) by this means the Fingers are rendered as it were defenceleſs, and eaſily obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto al kind of external injuries. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Malady doth deſervedly require a Cure. And yet nevertheleſs all the Nails that fal off can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſtored. For if from a depraved humor the whole root of the Nail be eaten aſunder, and the Malady hath now long continued; or if by reaſon of the want of Aliment the Nails be fallen off, they can very hardly be reſtored.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the external preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affects of the Body, and ſuch as are obvious unto the ſenſes, there remain Wounds, Fractures, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntings; of which we will now ſpeak in order. And Firſt of all, as touching a Wound, that it is a ſolution of Unity in a part, Bone, and ſofter <hi>Cartilage,</hi> is without al doubt and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. But yet nevertheleſs it is ſometimes taken largely, and ſomtimes in a more ſtrict ſence. <hi>Celſus</hi> taketh it in the largeſt ſence of all, whn (in his <hi>fifth B.</hi> and <hi>ſixth Chap.</hi>) he thus writeth; <hi>That Wound</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is far worſe, and more dangerous, which it cauſed only by a Bruiſe, then that which is made by inciſiom and dividing the part; ſo that it is alſo far better to be wounded by a ſharp and keen edged Weapon, then by that that is blunt.</hi> It is taken in a large acceptation, when it is attributed unto all kind of ſolution of Unity made by any ſharp inſtrument; whether this ſolution be made by pricking, or by cutting; like as <hi>Galen</hi> (in his <hi>Sixth B.</hi> of the <hi>Meth.</hi> of <hi>Phyſick</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>following Chap.</hi>) calleth the pricking of the Nerves the wounding of them. It is taken ſtrictly, when it is diſtinguiſhed from a pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; that a wound is the ſolution of Unity in a ſoft part, made by a Cut from any keen and cutting inſtrument; but a pricking is that ſolution of unity that is cauſed in a ſoft part, by a prick from an inſtrument that is cutting. By which it appeareth, that the ſolution of Continuity in a ſoft part is wider and broader then a Wound, whether it be made by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or by pricking. For Unity may alſo be diſſolved (in a ſoft part) by a thing that is not ſharp, but only hard and heavy; and this may be, the Skin either appearing whole, or even broken likewiſe, which happeneth in thoſe Wounds that are inflicted by Bullets from Guns, Moreover alſo the Unity of the ſoft part may be diſſolved by extenſion, which (in ſpecial) in the ſimilary parts is called Rupture, but in the Compound, <hi>Apoſpaſma;</hi> to wit, when thoſe fibrous Ligaments and Threads (by which the parts are faſtned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the one to the other,) being broken, the parts themſelves likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come broken.<note place="margin">A Wound what it is.</note> By all which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that a Wound is the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Unity in a ſoft part, cauſed by a cutting and ſharp inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>But if (as <hi>Guido</hi> in the <hi>Second B.</hi> of his <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery;</hi> and <hi>Fernelius</hi> in the <hi>ſeventh B</hi> of his <hi>Meth. of Phyſick, Chap ſixth,</hi> rightly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us) the Wound become ſordid and foul, and that ſome thing be by the <hi>Pus</hi> or filthy corroding matter eaten away from the ſubſtance of the wounded part, then the Wound paſſeth into an Ulcer; or certainly we may very well ſay that an Ulcer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the ſaid Wound. The truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is, that <hi>Rudius</hi> (in his <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Wounds,</hi> and <hi>firſt Chap.</hi>) doth impugn this Opinion; but al to little purpoſe. For neither is it abſurd (as he without Reaſon thinketh) that one Diſeaſe ſhould be changed into another, or that one ſhould be added and Joyned to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The Wound and Ulcer they are both of them the ſolution of Unity in the ſoft part; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the Wound is made by ſection of cutting alone, whereas the Ulcer is cauſed within it by Eroſion; and therefore it is that in an Ulcer there is ſomwhat that is loſt from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the part. If therefore in a Wound of any part ſomthing ſhall be Eaten away and conſumed from the ſubſtance of the fleſh, it is then altogether to be granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that now there is likewiſe preſent even an Ulcer alſo. Which nevertheleſs is not ſo to be taken, as though ſo ſoon as ever on the fourth day the <hi>Pus</hi> or filthy corrupt matter doth begin to appear in the Wound, that then likewiſe an Ulcer may be ſaid to be preſent. For that ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> proceedeth from the blood that is ſhed forth without the Veins; or ſome Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſticketh in the Capillary Veins, and ſpaces of the parts; neither is there then any thing Eaten away from the ſubſtance of the part. But if there be ſo great an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the <hi>Pus</hi> gathered together (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Cauſe thereof be) that ſomthing be Eaten away from the ſubſtance of the part; then it cannot be denied but that there is an Ulcer likewiſe preſent; ſeeing that there are then preſent all things that are required unto the Eſſence of an Ulcer; and in this Caſe, the Cure is no longer to be ordered as in a ſingle and ſimple Wound, but as in an Ulcer.</p>
                  <pb n="2594" facs="tcp:49110:136"/>
                  <p>But ſince that a Wound is to be accounted in the number of Diſeaſes, there may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry made (and that upon good grounds) what actions they are that are hurt thereby. Unto which it may be rightly anſwered, that all the Actions of the ſaid part, and the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all uſes thereof unto which the part is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are hurt by the Wound, whether that part perform thoſe actions, either as a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, or as an inſtrumental part. That the Organical Actions may oftentimes be hurt by a Wound, (to wit, when the part deſtined for motion is Wounded) cannot be denied, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t being a thing ſo manifeſt; ſince that the wounded Member can no longer be moved in a due and right manner. As likewiſe the Vein that is cut aſſunder can no longer convey the blood unto the part, for the nouriſhment thereof; neither a diſſected Artery the vital blood and ſpirits, or a Nerve the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                  <p>But indeed the truth is that the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the part is not next of all and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly hurt by the Wound; but yet never the leſs it is mediatly hurt; to wit, when the Veſſels being cut aſſunder, and the blood poured forth, the heat of the part is withal diſſipated, and the influx of the Blood, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and heat flowing in (this laſt being ſo neceſſary and requiſite unto the temperament of the part) is altogether hindred. For all which Cauſes, the attraction of the part, the Concoction, the Nutrition, and the expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is hurt. And from hence it happeneth, that the temperament being changed, there are more Excrements generated in that part, then otherwiſe were wont to be. And from thence alſo it proceedeth, that the <hi>Pus</hi> is not preſently generated in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Wound, but afterward, to wit, about the fourth day, when the heat of the part that was diſſipated is again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe is likewiſe hurt in the Wounded parts. The Skin being Wounded can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cover the parts lying underneath it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diſſected <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> the Inteſtines; the Cornea Tunicle of the Eye can no longer contain the Humors; neither can the Arteries when they are once cut in ſunder any longer contain, or convey the Blood; neither can the Nerves carry the Animal Spirits.</p>

                     <p>The Differences of Wounds, ſome of them are Eſſential, and others of them Accidental. The Eſſential are taken from the very Nature of the Wound, to wit, from the form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; in which reſpect, according to the Figure, ſome of them are ſtraight, other of them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and theſe indeed likewiſe of a very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Figure: in reſpect of their Magnitude, ſome of them are ſmal and others great; ſome deep, others of them only ſuperficial; and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo may this be referr'd, that a wound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inflicted, either there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But the Accidental Differences are ſuch as are drawn from thoſe things that are without the Definition of the Wound. <hi>Galen</hi> (in the <hi>Third B.</hi> of his <hi>Meth.</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and <hi>laſt Chap.</hi>) hath reduced them to three Chapters; and he teacheth us that they are taken either from the manner of their Generation; (to wit, that there is a total inciſion, or a total diſruption;) or elſe, that there is only a part cut, or a part broken. Secondly, From the ſituation of the Wound, to wit, when in a wound obliquely inflicted, one part of the Wound is in ſight, and another part lieth hid under the Skin. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There are likewiſe certain other Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Differences (we may rather call them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper) taken from thoſe things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the Wound; to wit, that that wound, is poyſonous that is inflicted by a poyſoned ſword; or elſe by the biting of ſome venemous beaſt: that there hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto the wound ſome inflammation, or an <hi>Eryfipelas;</hi> or that there is a Fracture, or diſioynting Joyned therewithall: or elſe that there is conjoyned an Hemorrhage, Pain, or ſome other Symptom.</p>

                     <p>We need not ſay much touching the Cauſes of Wounds. The Cauſes of a Wound that is made by cutting, are al thoſe things that have in them a power of Cutting, Swords, Glaſs, and the like. Of a Puncture (or pricking) the Cauſes are, whatſoever things are ſharp-poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as Arrows, Needles, and the teeth of living Creatures. Of Ruptures, ſuch things as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend the ſoft parts, and pul them into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary parts; ſuch as the lifting or carrying of ſome extraordinary weight, a Fall, Blow, lowd ſpeaking, and the like. Thoſe things that bruiſe, are all things Heavy, Hard, and Blunt, as Stones, Wood, Lead, and among theſe Leaden Bullets ſhot out of Guns have in them a power of perforating.</p>

                  <p>THe Truth is, that the wound it ſelf is (of it ſelf) ſufficiently manifeſt unto the ſenſes; and therefore needeth not any ſigns whereby it may be known But although that place in the Skin that is wounded be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and open to the ſenſe; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs if the Wound penetrate unto the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, what parts they are that are wounded within is oftentimes very obſcure, and hidden from us. But this may be known, firſt from the ſituation of the parts; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Action that is hurt, and the Uſe. Thirdly, From the ſupervening Symptoms; and Fourthly, from the Excrements. For if the wound of the Head be ſo inflicted that it be very deep, it ſheweth that the Brain is wounded: and if the whole Thorax or Cheſt be run through with a Sword, it argueth that the Lungs are likewiſe wounded; and ſo of all the other parts. For the exact and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledg of which, the Scituation of the parts is to be learnt from Anatomy. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Actions that are hurt do demonſtrate the Wounded part. And ſo, after a Wound received in the Privy parts, if the Urine flow forth of its own accord, it ſheweth that the Sphincter of the Bladder is hurt. But here notwithſtanding, we are wiſely and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider, (in caſe any Action be hurt) whether the hurt of the ſaid Action be not by Conſent of ſome other part. And therefore other Signs are to be conjoyned. If (a wound being received in the Abdomen,) the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines fall forth, it is an Argument that the Peritonaeum is cut a aſunder.</p>
                  <p>As for what concerneth the Excrements; if Chyle flow forth upon the receiving of a Wound, it is a ſign that the Stomach is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or the ſmal Bowels; if the Excrements of the Belly, that the greater and thicker In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines are wounded; if Urine flow forth of the Wound, then it ſheweth that the bladder is wounded; if out of the Wound of the <hi>Thorax</hi> (or Cheſt) Air paſs forth, it is a ſign that the Lungs are wounded. Whether it be a Vein or an Artery that is hurt and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the efflux of the Blood will ſhew; ſince that, what floweth forth from an Artery cometh forth Leaping and Dancing, as it were, and is more Red then that from the Veins.</p>
                  <p>We have notice likewiſe given us of the part that is wounded from the ſupervening Accidents. And ſo a vehement pain ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happening manifeſteth that ſome Nerve is wounded.</p>

                  <p>BEfore the Phyſitian attempt the Cure of a Wound, he ought Firſt to be very Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous and Inquiſitive touching the Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks. To wit, in the firſt place, he ought to foreknow, whether the Wound be Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or altogether incurable. And then if it be indeed curable, whether the Cure will be eaſie, or difficult; and whether or no the wounded perſon be like to have his former perfect ſoundneſs reſtored unto him; or elſe whether or no being Cured, and his Wound healed, he be likely to undergoe and ſuffer the hurt Action of ſome one or other of his Members. For ſo oftentimes it happeneth, that ſome Tendon being cut aſunder, the motion of ſome part is wholly loſt; and that the Brain being wounded, the Memory, or Rational faculty is thereby hurt: and More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, whether the wound be likely to be Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſhort, or whether it wil take up a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time. But on the other ſide, if the wound be altogether incurable; whether it be Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and ſuch as is likely to haſten Death; or elſe whether it be not more probable that it will degenerate into ſome long continuing Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, it muſt be foretold likewiſe, whether the Changes and Alterations of the Wound will be for the better, or for the worſe, and when theſe Changes wil be. Now in the firſt place, it muſt be diligently explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</p>

                     <head>What Wounds are Deadly, and what Wounds are not ſo.</head>
                     <p>For indeed this Queſtion is of very great Moment, and therefore moſt diligently and exactly to be weighed and known by the Phyſitian. For whereas oftentimes the lives
<pb n="2596" facs="tcp:49110:137"/> of ſome men are much hazarded and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, (when they are brought before the Magiſtrates in the publike Courts of Juſtice) by Reaſon of Wounds they gave unto others; and that oftentimes the Judges deſire the Phyſitians Opinion touching the ſame; great Care and a diligent Endeavour ought to be uſed, that the Phyſitian give ſo true a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo diſtinctly deliver his Opinion touching the quality of the ſaid Wounds, that the innocent may not be condemned, nor the Guilty acquited.</p>
                     <p>But in the firſt place we are to know that not every Wound which hath Death follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing it is to be called a Mortal wound, but that alone which in its own Nature bringeth Death. Now ſuch like wounds are twofold. For Mortal or Deadly (as <hi>Galen</hi> in the 5. <hi>B.</hi> of the <hi>Aphor. Aphor.</hi> 2. and <hi>Aph.</hi> 18. teacheth us) is ſomtimes taken and underſtood of thoſe wounds that are of neceſſity deadly and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again of ſuch Wounds as are ſo for the moſt part, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaketh; and ſuch as by Reaſon of which (as the ſame <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat.</hi> maketh the limitation in the 18. <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm,</hi> 6. <hi>Sect,</hi> in <hi>Coacis,</hi> or his tract of Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) thoſe that are wounded, almoſt, or for the moſt part die: like as <hi>Galen</hi> (in his 5. <hi>B. Aphor.</hi> 2.) writeth. that Deadly is to be taken for that that is dangerous, and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes terminated in Death. But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is here eſpecially of the former kind; for that wound that hath been at any time Cured in others cannot be taken for a wound ſimply Mortal and Deadly. But we ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward tel you, when it is to be taken and accounted for Mortal, or not Mortal. And therefore, Secondly, Wounds cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſimply Mortal, whereupon the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening of moſt grievous Symptoms (which ſaid Symptoms notwithſtanding do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies and neceſſarily follow upon the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe like wounds) the wounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dieth; as when in the Wounds of the Joynts, and the Nervous parts, an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Deliry, and other Symptoms happen; or that by Reaſon of a Cacochymy lying ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in the Body a feaver is kindled upon occaſion of the Wound. And it is altogether moſt true, that many things often fal out that render Wounds incurable, which in their own nature were curable. Like as neither are thoſe to be accounted for Wounds ſimply Mortal, the Curing of which is long protracted, &amp; by Reaſon of which it at length happeneth that the Wounded perſon periſheth by a ſlow and lingring Death: the ſame that happeneth when (the Lungs being Wounded) an Ulcer and the Conſumption follow thereupon; or the Thorax, or Stomack being wounded; which oftentimes after a long ſpace of time become the Cauſes of Death unto the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſon. For whenas it hath been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and known that theſe like Wounds have been healed in others, they cannot then be accounted for Wounds ſimply Mortal. But thoſe Wounds are only to be reputed ſimply Mortal, which in the ſpace of a few hours, or daies, do neceſſarily bring Death unto the ſick perſon, and cannot be cured by any Art. And therefore we are to diſtinguiſh between Wounds Mortal, and Wounds incurable. For all Mortal Wounds are incurable, but all Wounds that are incurable cannot be ſaid to be Mortal. For Wounds incurable (as we have told you) are al thoſe that though they cannot indeed be cured, yet notwithſtanding they are not ſuddenly the Cauſe of Death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wounded perſon, ſince that (although they cannot be healed) yet nevertheleſs the ſick perſon may after this live not only many Weeks but even yeers alſo. And ſuch a like Wound was that which <hi>Mathias Cornax</hi> (in his <hi>Epiſtle Reſponſory unto</hi> Dr. <hi>Aegidius Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togh.</hi>) and <hi>Julius Alexandrinus</hi> (in his <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon the ſixth Book of</hi> Galen <hi>his Meth. of Phyſick Chap.</hi> 4.) have deſcribed unto us. For when as a certain Bohemian Boor (as he was hunting) received a Wound in his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack with a broad hunting ſpear, it could not poſſibly be conſolidated but yet in tract of time the lips of the wound became hardn'd by a certain Callouſneſs growing over them, ſo that the wounded perſon ſurvived for many yeers after; and by applying of an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he could at his pleaſure evacuate his ſtomack.</p>
                     <p>And now in the next place let us ſee what Wounds they are that we may account to be ſimply Mortal, or Deadly. And now whereas Death happeneth upon the defect &amp; extinction of the Native heat; and that the Native heat may in a twofold manner be extinguiſhed, either ſenſibly and by degrees, (as it is in a Natural Death, and long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Diſeaſes, as the Conſumption, and the like,) or elſe ſuddenly and violently: the latter way it is that Wounds are ſaid ſimply and neceſſarily to bring Death unto the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſon, to wit, a violent one.</p>
                     <p>Now the innate heat is extinguiſhed, either becauſe the vital ſpirits are diſſipated, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſuffocated. And therefore all Wounds that are Mortal, and of neceſſity cauſe a ſudden and violent Death, either they ſuddenly ſuffocate the vital ſpirits, or elſe they diſſipate and corrupt them. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the Heart is the Store-houſe of the vital ſpirits and the Native heat, firſt of all therefore the Wounds of the Heart of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do eſpecially and moſt ſpeedily bring upon the Wounded Perſon a violent Death.
<pb n="2567" facs="tcp:49110:137"/> And the very truth is (as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth in his 5. <hi>B. of the places affected,</hi> and 3. <hi>Chapter</hi>) if the Wound penetrateth unto the ventricle of the Heart, (eſpecially the left) the wounded perſon of neceſſity dieth ſuddenly: but if the Wound penetrate not ſo far as unto the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, but that it conſiſt in the ſubſtance thereof, the man may then indeed live for a while, but yet nevertheleſs he muſt neceſſarily die this violent Death.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is of neceſſity that the man die, if ſome Veſſel be wounded in that part of the Lungs that are next unto the Heart, and that out of it ſtore of Blood be poured forth unto the Heart, overwhelming it, and ſuffocating the heat thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Al the internal wounds of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Veſſels that cannot by any art be cloſed upon regard they cauſe (the Blood being plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully poured forth either out of the Veins or the Arteries) that the ſpirits be ſuddenly diſſipated, therefore of neceſſity they ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffocate the wounded perſon.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, All thoſe Wounds are ſaid to be Mortal that ſuddenly take away the Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hinder the ventilation of the Heart, ſo that the Native heat of the Heart is ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and ſo cauſe that the Man die even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the very ſame manner as Apoplecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons are wont to die. And ſuch like wounds are eſpecially the Wounds of the Brain, but yet not all of them, ſince that there are many Wounds of the Brain that are not Mortal, as afterwards we ſhall ſhew you, and as we have already told you in the <hi>firſt B. of our Practice, firſt part,</hi> and 23. <hi>Chapter.</hi> But thoſe great Wounds, and ſuch as are the Cauſe that the Animal ſpirits be ſuddenly diſſipated, or that the blood being poured forth of the Veſſels the Orifice of the Nerves be quite ſtopped, and ſo by this means the influx of the Animal Spirits be hindered; or that from the ſame an inflammation of the Brain, or a feaver be excited. And this is not only done by the Wounds of the very Brain it ſelf, but likewiſe by the ſtrokes and vehement Confuſions of the Head, by which the Veſſels of the Brain (and thoſe neer about it) are broken, and the Blood poured forth of them unto the beginning of the Nerves, and there ſubſiſting hinder the influx of the Animal Spirits. And this may alſo happen. if the <hi>Sinus</hi> or hollow places of the Brain chance to be hurt, ſo that out of them blood be poured forth unto the Baſis of the Brain; and ſo it is likewiſe in the Wounds of the Eyes, if they penetrate ſo deep that they open either the Veſſels of the Brain, or thoſe that are in the Baſis thereof, or thoſe that are neer about the ſaid Baſis of the Brain, and ſo that the Blood poured forth unto the Baſis of the Brain hinder the influx of the Animal ſpirits by compreſſing the beginning of the Neryes. For although that the Blood (if it be poured forth above upon the Brain) may poſſibly be emptied forth by perforating and opening of the Cranium or Skul; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs if it be poured forth unto the Baſis of the Brain, it is impoſſible that it ſhould ever be evacuated.</p>
                     <p>There ſeemeth yet (nevertheleſs) to be another way, whereby the Blood poured forth into the Brain, or about the Brain, bringeth Death within a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry few daies, if it cannot be evacuated. For when as it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Veſſels, it beginneth to putrefie uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the fifth day; from whence feavers, deliries, and Convulſions are excited; ſo that the man dieth in the ſame manner almoſt as one in a Phrenſie.</p>
                     <p>That which is done by the Wounds of the brain, the very ſame happeneth likewiſe from the ſpinal Marrow, if it be indeed wholly cut aſſunder in the ſuperior part thereof: for then the motion of all the inferior parts (and ſo of the <hi>Thorax</hi> likewiſe) is aboliſhed, and the wounded perſons are ſuffocated. And unto one of theſe four waies I conceive that al kinds of Mortal Wounds may be referred. And therefore if a Wound penetrate into any interior part of the Body, ſo that thereupon the wounded perſon die within a ſhort ſpace of time, we are then to Judg that that Wound was Mortal; and if diligent inquiry be made, I am of Opinion that it may be referred unto ſome one kind or other of theſe Mortal Wounds: whether that Wound hurt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal faculty it ſelf immediatly; or elſe hurt it by the intervening of ſome other Diſeaſe, or Symptom. For, as <hi>Nicolaus Boetius</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of <hi>Felinus,</hi> (in his 323. <hi>Deciſion, Numb.</hi> 10.) it is all one, whether a Wounded man die of his Wound, or of ſome infirmity cauſed by the ſame. Which yet nevertheleſs is ſo to be underſtood, if the Wound neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily attract that Diſeaſe, or that Symptom which is the Cauſe of Death.</p>
                     <p>But as for all the other Wounds whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that cannot be referred unto ſome one of theſe manners, I conceive that they cannot ſimply nor neceſſarily be accounted Mortal. The which that it may be made the more plainly to appear, we have it now in our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in ſpecial to weigh and diſcover unto you the Wounds of all parts that are to be accounted Mortal.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Judgeth the wounds of ſeven parts to be Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,<note place="margin">What Wounds accounted Mortal by <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>

For although it hath indeed been obſerved, that Tumors and Ulcers have been found in the Heart; yet thoſe ſeeing that they ariſe and grow by degrees, life may ſomtimes for a while perſiſt together with them; although that in the concluſion even theſe alſo bring Death unto the Party.

For ſeeing that our life dependeth upon the ſafety of the ſpirits (whoſe Store-houſe and Fabrick is Scituated in the very Heart) the Heart being wounded, the ſaid treaſury and fabrick that it Scituated in the ſame muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be wounded likewiſe.

And I my ſelf ſaw an example of this in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Student, who in the year, 1633. in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> in the night received a wound, by a narrow ſharp pointed Sword run through his Breaſt on the right ſide thereof, about the Third ſhort Rib, neer unto the Arm-pit, and coming forth oppoſite unto it neer unto <hi>Spina;</hi> ſo that he ſent forth by the wound much Breath, with a great noiſe; and yet notwithſtanding this man recovered, and was well again within the ſpace of a month; and even now alſo (in this year, 1634. wherein I am writing theſe things) he is in good health and ſtrength.

The ſtory is this. <hi>There was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>among the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinates, in the town of</hi> Calmuntium, <hi>a certain perſon grievouſly wounded in his Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In the mean time, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian (together with a Chirurgeon) being ſent for, ſo ſoon as he was come, inſtantly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the part of the Lobe of the Lungs that hung forth, (being firſt well waſhed in Wine) ſhould again be thruſt back into the Breaſt. But in the handling thereof, perceiving that it began to look blackiſh and wan, he cauſed it to be cut off with a red hot Iron Inſtrument. But as for the Reſt of it, the Chirurgeon gently thruſt it back again into the Breaſt, the Ribbs being firſt dilated with a Wooden wedg that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly provided for that very purpoſe. And then after this, by the Art and Medicaments preſcribed by the Phyſitian, he was Cured; then being withal external means adminiſtred, and ſome certain pectoral Decoctions of Vulnerary Herbs for a few daies inwardly drunk; and ſo the wounded perſon perfectly recovered; and after this lengthened out his life for many years, his Lungs and Breaſt all the while continuing ſtill very ſound, and altogether free from all manner of hurt and detriment. And therefore we may conclude that the Wounds of the Lungs are not alwaies of themſelves Mortal, or incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; unleſs haply a deep Wound therein be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with an Inflammation; or elſe when the Wound hath hurt the great Veſſels, or the Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets thereof; or that the wound reacheth neer unto the Heart.</hi> And many other ſuch like Hiſtories <hi>Schenckius</hi> (in the 2. <hi>B.</hi> of his <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervat.</hi>) relateth out of <hi>Franciſcus Valleriola</hi> his <hi>fourth B.

I being called about the firſt hour of the Night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> found that his Pulſe was very weak, and that there was preſent a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Breathing; whereupon I had but ſmal hopes of him, as conceiving very great danger to be at hand, by Reaſon of the grievous hurt of hit Lungs, and the great Veſſels. But ſee what happened. A vomiting taking him ſuddenly (without any means uſed to procure it) all the grievous Symptoms ceaſed, and his ſtrength by degrees returned; there being no purulent spittle at all that offered to come forth; his Cough like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and difficult breathing were not very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and troubleſom; neither for the firſt Week
<pb n="2603" facs="tcp:49110:139"/> did any heat and thirſt very much affect the ſick perſon: in the interim, the wounds being handled after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſual manner, there daily flowed forth an indifferent Quantity of well concocted pus or purulent matter. Theſe means being continued unto the ſecond month, and the External wounds being purified and conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the ſick perſon was ſuddenly taken with a moſt dangerous ſuffocation; ſo that he was in great peril of being ſtrangled by an Aſthma as it were; and he was likewiſe very much afflicted with a cough, Atrophy, and Hectick Feaver, until at length the impoſthume of the Lungs brake, and with the Cough five or ſix pints of purulent matter were caſt up at his mouth; after which, the exulceration of the Lungs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cured by fit and proper Remedies, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, Fever Hectick, and all the reſt of the ſymptoms remitted, and the Patient was reſtored unto his perfect health.</hi>

                     <p>To wit, thoſe Wounds of the Lungs are not mortal, in which only the ſubſtance of the Lungs is hurt, and not the great veſſels; and ſuch as are not ſo great that they abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh reſpiration, or ſuddenly deſtroy the vital faculty, either by their diſlipating the ſprits through ſome notable Hemorrhage; or elſe ſuffocating the heart, by pouring out the blood upon the Lungs, and upon the heart. On the contrary, if the wound of the Lungs be great, and that not only the ſubſtance of the Lungs, but likewiſe the great veſſels that are therein (to wit, thoſe nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obſervable branches of the Arterial vein, and the veiny Artery, be wounded; thoſe wounds are mortal, being ſuch as in which the blood and vital ſpirit is poured forth and diſſipated, or elſe through the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergreat abundance of the blood the Lungs and heart are oppreſſed, and the Patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in <hi>the place alleadged</hi> in <hi>Coacis,</hi>) addeth yet another cauſe of death; which yet nevertheleſs doth not bring ſo ſudden a deſtruction unto any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as thoſe in the former caſe even now mentioned; where the wound being great, it is not the veſſels containing the blood that are indeed hurt, but the great and rough Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; ſo that by reaſon of the largneſs of the wound there is more breath that goeth forth by the wound then by the mouth; for then by reaſon of the ſympathy the heart is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the vital ſpirits diſſipated, the Lungs and heart by the ambient Air altered and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. And indeed thoſe wounds of the Lungs bring death likewiſe, in which either the ſubſtance of the Lungs beginneth to be exulcerated, (and that a Conſumption is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited) or in which the blood is poured forth into the Cavity of the Thorax, where it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to putrefy, and where it cauſeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a feaver, or an <hi>Empyema.</hi> But in regard that this doth not alwaies happen, and not at al in ſome wounds of the Lungs; and that likewiſe (when it doth happen) there is no neceſſity that the Patient die; for this cauſe therefore thoſe wounds of the Lungs are not to be accounted neceſſarily Mortal. For <hi>Felix Platerus</hi> (in his 3. <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Obſrv. Page</hi> 690.) relateth, that a certain perſon that he knew, falling into a Conſumption from a Wound of the Lungs, was yet nevertheleſs Cured and perfectly recovered. <hi>A certain Coffermaker (ſayth he) one of our Citizens; having from a ſervant of his received a wound very deep in the loweſt part of the Thorax by a prick from the point of a knife, by the wound he voided forth a moſt ſtinking and loathſom pus or matter (by the ill ſavor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the whol neighborhood was infected and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and likewiſe ſome certain ſmal parcells of his Lungs, in which the cartilaginous branches of the rough Artery did manifeſtly appear: which perſevering a long time, albeit that he was in a manner wholly waſted away, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs at the length the flowing forth of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent matter remitting, the wound was cloſed, and he reſtored unto perfect ſoundneſs; living after this many years as a foot-poſt, in carrying of letters; and thus he prolonged his life for forty years ſafe and found, as we ſay; although (as it is very probable) he wanted great part of his Lungs in one ſide.</hi>

And I my ſelf alſo have twice ſeen ſuch like wounds cured.

                        <note place="margin">Wounds of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm.</note>Sixthly, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the Wounds of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm among thoſe wounds that are mortal. But <hi>Galen</hi> (in his Book 5. of the <hi>Method of Phyſick, Chapt.</hi> 9. diſtinguiſheth between thoſe wounds of the diaphragm that are inflicted upon the nervous part therof, &amp; thoſe that are made in its fleſhy part; and thoſe he wil have to be mortal, but theſe latter Curable. And yet nevertheleſs (in the <hi>Sixth of the Aphoriſm.

For then it is indeed that thoſe grievous ſymptoms plainly appear, <hi>viz.</hi> a deliry or ſtupid dotage, difficult breathing, Feavers, Convulſions, and (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath likewiſe obſerved in his third Book <hi>of the parts of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creatures and tenth Chapt.</hi>) the <hi>Sardoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Laughter, wherin the ſick perſons die laughing. For whereas the Diaphragm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Nerves from the third and fourth vertebra of the Neck, and that theſe are mingled with thoſe ſmal branches that are propagated throughout the Muſcles that move the Jawbones, and the Lips; if they ſuffer a Convulſion in that part by which they reach even unto the Diaphragm, they then contract and draw together along with them thoſe little branches of the Muſcles of the face; by which the Jawbones, and the lips being involuntarily moved to and fro, hither and theither, cauſe a reſemblance and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appearance of laughter; which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates (in the</hi> 5 <hi>of his Epidem.)</hi> accounteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe ſigns that are deadly, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Tycho,</hi> whom he bringeth in for an inſtance.</p>
                     <p>And yet nevertheleſs, neither are thoſe very wounds that are alſo in the nervous part of the Diaphragm alwaies mortal, ſo far forth indeed that the party wounded in that place muſt of neceſſity preſently die: albeit we grant it to be a thing altogether impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that thoſe who are thus wounded ſhould ever be perfectly cured, or live long in that manner. A notable inſtance and hiſtory of this (which I have likewiſe before related in the ſecond Book of my <hi>Inſtitutions part.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. and in the ſecond Book of my <hi>Pract.

Take it therefore thus: <hi>In the year</hi> 1582, <hi>the</hi> 20. <hi>of</hi> September, <hi>a certain Student, by name</hi> Henricus Euſcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovius, <hi>returning out of the lower Saxony unto</hi> Witteberg, <hi>and much addicted to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, before the gate ran himſelf through with his own ſword. But yet notwithſtanding with in two monthes he was cured of this wound. But the yeer following, the</hi> 28. <hi>of</hi> April, <hi>he began again to be much amiſs; and the days follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he vomited very often, firſt a certain water and whatſoever food he had eaten; then after that ſuch things as were green; and at length, on the ſecond of</hi> May, <hi>his vomitings were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether black, and that in very great abundance; and ſo after the laſt vomit the ſame ſecond day of May he died. We opened his Body, and there we found that the wound had penetrated thorow the Lungs, and the Diaphragm; and (as it ſeemed to us) the Diaphragm was run thorow in the Nervous circle. We found very little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Lungs on the left ſide that was run thorow, but only a very ſmal portion thereof which ſtuck above unto the ſhort Ribs; the reſt of it (no doubt) had gone forth thorow the wound together with the purulent matter. The whole ſtomack was aſcended into the left ſide of the Thorax; and it had driven the Heart (with its Caſe,) out of its proper place into the right ſide; where while he was yet alive, and after the wound was reſtored unto a good degree of health, he would wiſh us to obſerve the motion of his heart by putting our hands there.</hi> An inſtance not much unlike unto this we have in <hi>Ambroſius Paraeus</hi> his ninth Book, And <hi>Chapt.</hi> 30. Of a certain Captain that was (by a bullet ſhot out of an hand-gun) wounded and ſhot quit thorow the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm,</hi> but it was in the fleſhly part thereof; who dying eight months after this wound received, we found in his dead body (when we had opened it) that a very great part of the Gut Colon, being puffed and ſwoln up with much wind, had thorow the wound of the Diaphragm gotten up into his Thorax.</p>

Neither is that other hiſtory unknown, of a certain Boor in Bohemia; which as others have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it, ſo we find it likewiſe mentioned by <hi>Crollius,</hi> in the preface to his <hi>Baſilica Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica; in theſe very words. In the year</hi> 1602. <hi>at</hi> Prague, <hi>in the new Town, we ſaw a certain Bohemian Boor (by name</hi> Matthaeus) <hi>about thirty ſix years old: who for two years together (by an admirable and unheard of dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity that he had in his throat) would often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the company of his drunken companions hide in his wide throat (as it were in a ſheath) an Iron knife of a fit ſize, Firſt of al thruſting in the horn haft thereof, with the wonted ſleight of a Jugler; drinking upon it a large draught of beer that they gave him for this purpoſe; and afterward he would pul it back again by the point thereof, at his pleaſure, by a ſingular art and dexterity that he had: but at length (the morrow after Eaſter) I know not by what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and mad raſhneſs of his he had ſwallowed it ſo far down, that it wholly deſcended into his ſtomack, and could no more by al his art and cunning be from thence drawn back. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that (half dead in a manner with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of death undoubtedly and ſuddenly to follow) he had lodged in his ſtomack the ſaid knife ſeven wol weeks, and two days, by the uſe and help of attractive emplaſters of the Loadſtone, and other the like, the point of the knife by a natural impulſe began to make its way forth neer unto the orifice of the ſtomack: which was no ſooner perceived by the patient, but he inſtantly and earneſtly requeſted of the Chirurgeons (who notwithſtanding diſſwaded him from it, by reaſon of the extream hazard of his life thereby) that it might by cutting be drawn forth. Which at the length upon his continual importunate deſires (and yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as he was come unto a moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Condition, both in reſpect of his poverty and weakneſs) was yielded unto; and the buſineſs undertaken by the principal Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both of the kingdom, and that City,</hi> Floria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Matthias <hi>by name, a Brandeburger, on the thurſday after the feaſt of Pentecoſt, at ſeven of the clock in the morning; and by him (with Gods aſſiſtance) it was happily effected. The colour of the knife after he had cut it forth (it being as long as nine thumbs in breadth) was ſo changed in his ſtomack, as if it had layn all that while in the fire, and was immediatly laid up among the Rarities of the Emperour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been firſt ſhewn (a thing moſt ſtrange, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and miraculous) unto many men, as well Courtiers, as Citizens. And thus this Boor in the ſpace of a few weeks (by the uſe of fit and convenient remedies, adminiſtred unto him by that moſt expert Chirurgeon) without any further ſickneſs and trouble, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies eating wel, and drinking, and ſleeping (as ſomtimes he told me himſelf) by the bleſſing of God, and the liberal Charity of many people toward him in his low and poor condition, (contrary unto the determinate aſſertion of Phyſical Aphoriſms) fully recovered his wonted perfect health and ſoundneſs; and not long after he married a Wife.</hi> But thoſe wounds of the Stomack are eſpecially mortal that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the ſuperiour orifice thereof; in regard that it hath thoſe conſiderable Nerves that ariſe from the ſixth Conjugation of the Brain, and thereby obteineth a very neer conſent with the Brain and Heart; ſo that it being wounded, moſt grievous Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms may very eaſily be excited. And <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivenius</hi> (in his <hi>tenth B. of the hidden Cauſes of Diſeaſes that are curable Chap.</hi> 110.) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that a certain Fuller with one blow of his fiſt upon the Stomack of a young Man, ſmote him ſo violently, that he immediatly died thereof.</p>
                     <p>Eightly,<note place="margin">The wounds of the ſmal Guts.</note> The Wounds of the ſmaller Guts are by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> accounted and reckoned up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe that are Mortal.

                     <p>But now the wounds of the thicker Guts are leſs dangerous, and eſpecially if they be not great: and that oftentimes ſuch like wounds have been Cured, appeareth from the many extant Obſervations of Phyſitians: which <hi>Schenckius</hi> (in his <hi>Obſervations) hath Collected.</hi>

For <hi>Aegineta</hi> hath truly told us (in his 6. <hi>B.</hi> and 28. <hi>Chap.</hi>) that the Liver having been wounded, and a part thereof cut away, yet that the wounded perſon may be preſerved. And <hi>Gemma</hi> relateth (in the <hi>firſt B. of his Coſmocrit.</hi> and 6. <hi>Chap.</hi>) that a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh youth a great part of whoſe Liver brake forth by the wound of the right Gut, was yet notwithſtanding Cured. And <hi>Bertinus</hi> alſo (in his 13. <hi>B.</hi> and 7. <hi>Chap.</hi>) writeth, that a Noble perſon after a wound inflicted neer about the Region of his Liver, and a ſmal part of the ſubſtance thereof drawn forth and cut off, yet eſcaped, and became ſound again. And the ſame hath likewiſe been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by others. <hi>Guilhelmus Fabricius</hi> (in his 2. <hi>Cent.

And yet notwithſtanding we ſay, that they only recover, who have the ſuperficies alone, or the ſubſtance of their Liver only wounded, without any hurt at all of the great Veſſels. For if there be wounded any one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Veſſels, the wounded perſon cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly eſcape; and by reaſon of the large effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Blood, the Man (before that the wound can be Sodered and Agglutinated) dieth. And of theſe ſome indeed for a very ſhort time have their life protracted; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them die in an inſtant, or at leaſt, in a very ſhort ſpace. For (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his 5. <hi>Epidem.</hi> telleth the ſtory,) a certain perſon having had a dart thruſt into his Liver immediatly the colour of a dead Carcaſs was diſperſed all his Body over; his Eyes ſunk in his Head, a difficulty of breathing (together with an aeſtuation or ſudden vehement paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) followed after this; and the ſame day he died. Another Boy being ſtrucken upon his Liver by a Mule, died the fourth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and before his Death he was troubled with a ſhort and thick breathing; neither underſtood he any thing; but all the while (until he died,) lay under a feaver.</p>

                        <note place="margin">VVounds of the Bladder.</note>Eleventhly, The Wounds of the Bladder are likewiſe found in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Catalogue of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wounds. But yet nevertheleſs here alſo a diſtinction is requiſite. For a ſmal wound is ſoon ſodered together by the intervening of fleſh, as <hi>Galen</hi> (in the 6. of the <hi>Aphoriſm. Aph.</hi> 18.) and Experience teach us. But if the whole Bladder chance to be cut quite through (which wound <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calleth <hi>Diacope</hi>) the Wound is then yet more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. And indeed that is moſt eſpecially perillous which is inflicted at the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Bladder, and the Nervous pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> thereof: for by Reaſon of the ſharpneſs and extremity of the pain, the inflammation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thereupon, and the continual feaver, the party dyeth ſoon after. But as for theſe Wounds that are inflicted at the Neck of the Bladder (which is fleſhly) they are Curable; as we are taught even by the Cutting of the Stone. And yet nevertheleſs it hath been obſerved, that the Bladder wounded even in the very bottom thereof hath likewiſe been Cured; the truth of which we have confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto us by thoſe examples we meet with in the <hi>Obſervations</hi> of <hi>Schenckius.</hi> For the whole Bladder is not altogether Nervous, but the Exterior Membrance thereof is more fleſhy; whereupon <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente,</hi> and <hi>Spigelius,</hi> account the ſaid Membrane for the Muſcle that ſhutteth the Bladder. But it is very rare that ſuch a like wound of the Bladder is perfectly Cured, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that the wounded perſon die not thereof; but a Callouſneſs being brought over it, the Pipe ſtill remaineth, by which the Urine is voided, forth. But yet nevertheleſs it is not long that a man can continue to live with ſuch a like wound: and therefore we ſay here again as we ſaid alſo before, that there is a difference to be made between a wound Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and a wound incurable. But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, touching al the Wounds of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels hitherto mentioned, this is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; that albeit there have been obſerved ſome examples of ſuch like wounds that have been Cured; yet that this hath happened ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely; and that among theſe, thoſe are to be numbered, touching which <hi>Averrhoes</hi>
                        <pb n="2607" facs="tcp:49110:141"/> ſaith, that in the Cure of Diſeaſes there are ſomtimes Miracles wrought. For when fit and proper Medicaments cannot be applied unto internal wounds, but that the whole work muſt be committed unto Nature; if in this Caſe Nature be not very ſtrong and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, the wounded perſon is very hardly Cured; but for the moſt part an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Convulſions, Faintings and Swoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and other the like Symptoms ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, the party dieth. And therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith rightly (in the <hi>ſixth</hi> of his <hi>Aphoriſm. Aphor.</hi> 18.) that ſuch wounds are Mortal; and (in his <hi>Coaca</hi>) that moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and for the moſt part, men die of ſuch Wounds. And therefore if upon the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſuch a wound, the ſick perſon die within a ſhort time after, the Cauſe of his Death ought to be imputed unto the Wound; ſince that much help is not to be hoped for from the Phyſitian, as we ſhal alſo anon ſhew you.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the Wounds of the greater Veins among thoſe that are Mortal,<note place="margin">Wounds of the great Veins.</note> and indeed rightly. But now by the word <hi>Phlebae</hi> he underſtandeth both the Veins and Arteries; and by <hi>Pacheis</hi> he meaneth great, and lying hid within; which elſewhere he termeth <hi>Aimorrhous,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>pouring forth Blood;</hi> ſuch as are, the great hollow Vein, and the great Artery, and the great branches of theſe. For ſuch veins and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, ſeeing that they cannot be ſhut cloſe by any ligature whatſoever, (the blood and the ſpirits plentifully flowing forth of them) the ſtrength and powers of the Body are ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; or elſe the blood that is fallen forth without its own proper Veſſels, if it hath no paſſage forth, but that it be ſtill deteined in the Body, it Clotteth together and putrefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and getteth unto it ſelf a very evil, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and Malignant Nature, cauſeth a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, and exciteth moſt grievous Symptoms, and at length bringeth even death it ſelf upon the party. And indeed this danger is moſt grievous and formidable in the Arteries, when the Blood and vital ſpirits being poured forth the powers of the Body are dejected, and the mans life endangered; neither can the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries be eaſily brought to cloſe, by Reaſon of their continual motion, and hard ſubſtance. And theſe are the Wounds that (as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> rightly ſaith) are Mortal. Of which notwithſtanding (as I told you before) ſome are ſimply or altogether Mortal: which <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper Farinaceus (Tit. de Homicidis, Queſt.</hi> 125. <hi>Part</hi> 3.) defineth, that they are ſuch that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not the Care and advice of Phyſitians, but are ſuch of which the Wounded perſon dyeth, that is, by Reaſon of which (although they be Cured by all the Art and induſtry of the moſt skilful Phyſician,) yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Wounded perſon inſtantly dieth thereof. And others of them are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mortal, and certain in their cauſing of death; which the ſame <hi>Proſper Farinacius</hi> defineth to be ſuch, of which the Wounded party dieth not ſuddenly; and of which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he dieth not at all.</p>
                     <p>But what Wounds of the latter ſort are Mortal, that is, of which although ſome are now and then cured, and recover their perfect health and ſtrength, yet nevertheleſs this or that particular perſon may truly be ſaid to have died of them; will indeed plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from what we ſaid before touching the Mortal Wounds of each ſingle and particular part. And yet nevertheleſs this is likewiſe to be added; that we are eſpecially to Judg by the Event, whether any ſuch Wound be actually Mortal, or not. For although ſome ſtrong and luſty Boor, or a Man otherwiſe exactly found and healthful ſhall recover of ſome ſuch wound; yet Nevertheleſs it will not neceſſarily follow, that therefore an old perſon, a Child, a Woman, or any other that is but of a weak conſtitution, muſt recover of the like wound; but albeit the former of theſe was cured of the like wound, yet this latter may neceſſarily die of the ſame. But now whether or no ſuch dangerous Wounds be Mortal in this or that particular perſon, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus Boerius</hi> (in his 323. <hi>Deciſion, Num.</hi> 11.) teacheth us how we may diſcover it, by fix Conjectures. The firſt whereof is, the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the time; to wit, if the ſick perſon die very ſuddenly after the Wound: of which ſpace of time, (albeit there be very many opinions touching it) yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he ſaith that the principal is this, if the wounded perſon ſhall die within three daies after the wound received. But yet however there are ſome that extend this ſpace of time unto the fifth, or even alſo unto the eighth day. But others notwithſtanding extend this term even unto the eighth month, or a whole year; and this ſeemeth unto me moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And unto this ſpace of time the Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law (<hi>Exod. Chap.</hi> 21.) ſeemeth to have reſpect. The Second Conjecture is, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering of the vomiting, and feaver, and other Symptoms that from the very firſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed and threatened death. And this is a right Conjecture, and according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all Phyſicians, yea even of <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf. For thoſe great and mortal Wounds have their Decretory and Critical daies, like as Acute Diſeaſes have, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tels us (2 <hi>Prorrhet.</hi>) in the which good or evil Symptoms are wont to happen. And therefore, if grievous Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="2608" facs="tcp:49110:142"/> (ſuch as are Convulſions, Vomitings, ſobbings, Dotages, Syncopes, and the like; which otherwhiles alſo are wont to preſage Death in ſuch as are wounded) preſently and even from the very firſt invade the wounded perſon; or elſe appear upon him on the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical day, and after continually perſevere, they then ſignifie, that they were neceſſarily brought upon the Party by the Wound, and therefore that the Wound is altogether mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. The third Conjecture is, the breadth and depth of the Wound. For a Wound that is very great and dangerous in it ſelf may yet although it be great, yet not be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if by it no Noble part be hurt. The fourth Conjecture is, the quality of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument with which the Wound is given, and by which the perſon inflicting the Wound is convinced that he had a will and purpoſe to kil the party Wounded. But this conjecture concerneth rather the Court of Juſtice, then the Colledg of Phyſitians; who inquire not ſo much after the will and intention of the perſon wounding, as ſimply and ſolely after the quality of the Wound it ſelf. The fifth and ſixth, is, the Continual pain, from whence the Convulſion is brought upon the wounded perſon. But theſe conjectures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the Second. And thus, whether or no any one die of a dangerous Wound, and of that kind of them which almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies are Mortal, the Phyſitian out of thoſe ſix aforeſaid Conjectures, maketh uſe of two of them eſpecially, whereby he Concludeth that that wound (touching which the inquiry is made) was in it ſelf Mortal and deadly. Firſt, from the ſhortneſs of the time that the wounded party lived after his Wound. And then next of all, from the State and Condition of the wounded perſon, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies (after his Wound) falleth from bad to worſe, until his Death; and thoſe grievous and deadly Symptoms, which either preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or on the Critical day, followed upon the wound, and continually afflicted the ſick wounded perſon. And unto the two former we may not unfitly add likewiſe a third; to wit, if nothing hath been either committed, or omitted, that might render the Wound Mortal. For from theſe we may Collect, both that the Condition of the Wound was ſuch, that it might bring death unto the Party; and that the wounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had ſuch a diſpoſition that was not able to maſter the Wound. And theſe in all the aforeſaid particular parts are thoſe Wounds that are deſervedly to be accounted Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
                     <p>As for the wounds of the reſt of the parts, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> rightly pronounceth them not mortal; &amp; indeed experience teacheth us, that ſomtimes the greateſt and moſt dangerous wounds have been cured; of which there are divers Hiſtories recited by <hi>Valleriola,</hi> in his fourth Book, <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 10. And there are every where the like extant, in the obſervat. of <hi>Guilhel. Fabricius,</hi> and the writings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phyſitians. But yet notwithſtanding it oftentimes ſo happeneth that thoſe very wounds of which ſome have recovered have proved mortal unto ſome others; and that very many alſo die of moſt ſleight and inconſiderable wounds. And <hi>Hippocrates (in</hi> 2. <hi>Prorrhet.)</hi> writeth, that a man may chance to die of any kind of wounds. Of which we meet with examples almoſt in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Author. Touching the Child of <hi>Philias, Hippocrates (in the ſeventh Book of his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.)</hi> writeth, that he died of only the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare of the forehead bone, a feaver ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening for one day, and a certain wan leaden color contracted in the ſad bone. And the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> likewiſe relateth that the Child of one <hi>Theodorus,</hi> upon the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare of a bone, (almoſt of no moment) died the 23. day after. And that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon, Maſter of a great ſhip, having hurt and bruiſed his fore-finger on the right hand, and his mouth, with an Anchor, (an inflammation and convulſion ſupervening) on the thirteenth day following died thereof. And that <hi>Telephanes</hi> alſo the ſon of <hi>Harpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> by his free woman received a blow in the great toe of one of his feet; upon which an inflammation, &amp; a vehement pain followed; which remitting, the ſick perſon fell into a convulſion, and died the third day. And ſo <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth (<hi>in the ſeventh Book of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Hiſt. Chapt.</hi> 53.) That <hi>Aemilius Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus,</hi> Cruſhing but his thumb againſt the bedpoſt, breathed his laſt. And that <hi>Caius Aufidius</hi> going into the Senate houſe, only hurting his foot, died of the ſame ere he could be carried home to his own houſe. <hi>Petrus Foreſtus (in the ſixth Book of his Chirurgical obſervat. Obſervat.</hi> 50.) reporteth that a certain Conſul (<hi>Alcmarianus</hi> by name) waſhing his feet as he was wont to do and endeavoring to cut and pare away the thick Callous skin in the ſole of his foot, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf, and that a ſpaſm following upon it, he died immediatly. And oftentimes likewiſe a Gangreen followeth upon the wounds, and make them deadly, And ſo <hi>Petrus Foreſtus (in the ſixth Book of his Chirurgic. obſervations, Obſer.</hi> 49.) tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us of a certain perſon that hurt his Leg by hitting of it againſt ſomthing that was hard, and that upon this bruiſe and wound of his Leg a Gangrene ſoon after following took his life from him. And <hi>Guilhel. Fabricius (in the fifth Cent. of his
<pb n="2609" facs="tcp:49110:142"/> obſervat. Obſer.</hi> 2.) mentioneth two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. One of a certain Labourour, who prickt his foot with a thorn; and the other of a woman that with a thorn likewiſe woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the very tip of her right forefinger; both which upon the ſupervening of a Gangrene died. And <hi>Johannes Matthaeus (in his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Quaeſt, quaeſt.</hi> 27.) writeth that at. <hi>Freu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denberg,</hi> a town of the Dominion of Naſſaw, receiving but a ſleight wound in one of his ſhoulders, died thereof. And that another in the County of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> being but very ſleightly wounded with a knife in the middle of his Thigh, died immediatly. And that at <hi>Lemgovia</hi> a certain Citizens ſon, being but ſleightly hurt in his Arm by the ſword of a Student, (Contrary unto the expectation of all that ſaw him) died within one hour after. And <hi>Horatius Augenius (in the firſt Tom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of his Epiſt. Book</hi> 9. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.) relateth very many hiſtories of them that have peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed upon ſleight and inconſiderable wounds. And examples to confirm this truth we very frequently meet with in the reading of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and more eſpecially thoſe before mentioned. Now this happeneth for divers Cauſes, which <hi>Hippocrates likewiſe (in</hi> 2. <hi>Prorrhet.)</hi> toucheth upon in theſe words. <hi>Whoſoever (ſaith he) would know, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning wounds, in what manner they ſhal end, each of them Particularly; in the firſt place he ought ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ought moreover to know the ſeveral ages in which every particular is difficult to be cured; and to be wel acquainted likewiſe with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts and places in all kind of bodyes, how far forth they differ each from other. He ought alſo to know even theſe other things that happen in each of them, of what nature and quality they are, and whether they be good, or evil. For if any one ſhall know and wel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all theſe things, he may indeed then likewiſe know the ſeveral events of each particular wound. But he that ſhall be ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of theſe things can never know what ſhall be the ends and events of Wounds. I ſhall reckon them up in this order following.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">VVounds Curable from what cauſes they are made Mortal.</note>For Firſt of all, if the Sword, dart, (or whatſoever it be that inflicteth the Wound) be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, a Wound then that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but ſleight in it ſelf may yet bring death.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>Idaea of Men</hi> (as <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſpeaketh) ought heedfully to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for ſuch as are of a Robuſt ſtrong bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſound, theſe likewiſe bear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the moſt grievous Wounds; and they are oftentimes cured of them without any great a doe: and although that many times very grievous Symptoms may ſupervene, inſomuch that you would judg them even ready to die; yet notwithſtanding beyond all hope and expectation they eſcape, and recover again. And hitherto apperteineth the vitious diſpoſition of the body, and the preſent Cacochymy. For if any Wound ſhall befall unto Such a like Body, Nature being irritated and ſtirred up is wont to thruſt forth thoſe vitious humors unto the Wound; whereupon other diſeaſes and ſymptoms happening, that wound which in a ſound and pure body was Curable, here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Mortal; concerning which <hi>Galen</hi> thus ſpeaketh (<hi>in his ſixth Book of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces affected, Chapt.</hi> 2.) ſuppoſe, ſaith he that one came unto us that had only his skin pricked with a Needle; this Man (if he be one whoſe wounds are wont to be eaſily healed) although without any medicament adminiſtred, with his Member naked and bare, you ſend him to his accuſtomed labour and imployment, will yet take no hurt, nor feel no evil: whereas thoſe whoſe Wounds are not cured without much difficulty, and that are either Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>thorical, or oppreſſed with vitious Juyces; theſe in the firſt place feel indeed a certain pain in the Wound; and afterward a part thereof will infeſted both with a beating pulſe, as alſo with a <hi>Phlegmone:</hi> and it is found, that of ſuch like ſmal and ſleight wounds oftentimes Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, inflammations, a Gangrene, yea death it ſelf hath followed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Age is wel to be conſidered; in regard of which alſo there may be a very various Event of Wounds. For thoſe Wounds that are grievous and difficult, yea Mortal, in an old man or a Child, theſe in a man that is young and ſtrong, are not mortal yea are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times accounted very ſlight &amp; inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A Wound that otherwiſe is cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may yet become Mortal, by reaſon that either the Surgeon is wanting; or if he come he chance to prove either negligent, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful: and ſo by reaſon of the hemorrhage (in the want of a Chirurgeon) whoſe part it was to ſtanch and ſtop it by ligatures, and otherwiſe, a man may often run a great haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of his life, although the wound were not otherwiſe Mortal. And ſo, if the Wounds of the brain, of the Nerves, of the Joynts, be unskilfully and negligently handled, (an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, Convulſion, Gangrene, and the like evils befalling the Party) the man may miſcarry and periſh, notwithſtanding that the Wound (had it been rightly handled) were in it ſelf Curable.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Sometimes there happen grievous ſymptoms ſo ſuddenly that although both the Phyſitian and the Chirurgeon beſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="2610" facs="tcp:49110:143"/> with al poſſible diligence, before theſe can be calmed and quieted, other diſeaſes and ſymptoms happen, by which the man is quite deſtroyed. And therefore oftentimes the very pain in the part wounded (it being of a very exquiſite ſenſe) cauſeth an afflux of humors, the afflux of humors an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the inflammation a Fever, a Gangrene, and then death. And this indeed happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the more eaſily, if the wound be in a part that is in it ſelf indeed ignoble, but yet ſuch as can very eaſily draw a part that is Noble into a conſent with it.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Both the Conſtitution of the Air, and the propriety of the place, have here a peculiar power. So the Wounds in the Head that in many (yea the moſt) places are not Mortal, in other places are Mortal; which yet nevertheleſs ſome there are that reckon them up otherwiſe. <hi>Vidus Vidius (in his ſixth Book of the Cure of diſeaſes Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Page</hi> 249.) writeth, that at <hi>Florence</hi> the Wounds of the head are Mortal to moſt men; and he aſcribeth the cauſe unto the cold thin Air; but that at <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Lions</hi> very few die of them, in regard the Air is there thicker and warmer. <hi>Amatus Luſitanus (in his ſixth Cent. Curat.</hi> 100.) Writeth that at <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Bononia</hi> the Wounds of the head are extremely dangerous, but not ſo at <hi>Raguſum.</hi> And <hi>Ambroſius Paraeus</hi> teſtifieth, that wounds of the head are far more difficult to cure at <hi>Paris,</hi> then they are at <hi>Avignion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, An ill courſe of Diet may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe wounds deadly that in themſelves are not very dangerous: to wit, if the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded party either eat meats of an ill Juice, be much moved with anger, terrified with fear, Laugh immoderately, and uſe venery. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this truth, as we meet with them in others, ſo eſpecially <hi>Guilhem. Fabricius</hi> (in the <hi>firſt Cent. of his obſervat, Obſer.</hi> 22. <hi>and in his</hi> 5 <hi>Cent. Obſerv.</hi> 75. and in the 1 <hi>Cent. of his Epiſt. n.</hi> 1.) reciteth certain of them; as they are there to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>And unto this kind of cauſe, and in ſpecial to a ſudden fear and affrightment, or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wrath, thoſe wounds are to be referred, that being in themſelves but ſleight &amp; ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly conſiderable, yet notwithſtanding many have been known to die of them within the ſpace of a very few hours. For although that the Nerves being pricked and a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion excited, a man may ſuddenly die; yet nevertheleſs, in regard that in theſe there is happening neither any Convulſion, nor yet any other ſuch like grievous ſymptom appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; it is therefore credible, that they died by reaſon of the vehemency of the Paſſions of Wrath and fear; in regard that theſe Affects of the Minde have in them a very great power of affecting the Body. Of which thing we have every where examples extant. <hi>Suidas</hi> writeth, that a certain perſon natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally timerous and fearful, hearing but the bare report of <hi>Hercules</hi> his coming hid himſelf for fear in a private place; from whence now and then looking forth, and it length ſeeing <hi>Hercules</hi> by chance paſſing by, he fell down dead with fear. And ſo <hi>Julia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Pompey</hi> died ſuddenly, upon the ſight only of her husbands Garment ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with blood. And as <hi>Plutarch</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Lentulus</hi> alſo hearing unexpectedly of the death of <hi>Pompey</hi> fel down dead ſuddenly. And ſome there are that upon the fight of their own blood in veneſection, or when they have received any Wound have preſently ſwound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſunk away. And <hi>Manlius</hi> (in his <hi>Common places, Sub.</hi> 5. <hi>Praecept.</hi>) relateth this hiſtory. <hi>A Fool or Natural (ſaith he) for ſome fault by him committed was brought forth unto a pretended and feigned, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intended puniſhment; as if he ſhould have been beheaded. The Headſman cometh, and ſhews him the ſword indeed, thereby only to terrify and ſcare him, and withal lightly ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him on the neck with a little wand, and thereby makes the Man (fearful and faint-hearted fool as he was) to fall down dead, to the admiration and aſtoniſhment of al the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</hi> And <hi>Johannes Matthaeus,</hi> (in his <hi>Phyſical Queſt. Queſt.</hi> 27.) <hi>telleth us this ſtory. When (ſaith he) in the Court of the moſt illuſtrious Prince</hi> Erneſtus Fredericus Marqueſs of Bada, <hi>his Highneſſes Chief Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of his Chamber</hi> Johan. Beckber <hi>a Plethorick young man, was but lightly touched in his lower eyelid with a blunt-pointed ſword (ſuch as they were wont altogether to exerciſe themſelves with in their fencing ſchools) from the hand of a young beardleſs youth, poſſeſſed with rage and indignation, and taking it moſt heynouſly thus to be foyld by a boy, and his own ſcholar, fell ſuddenly into a moſt grievous Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptick Convulſion, which in the ſpace of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>our or five hours ended his life.</hi> And I my ſelf alſo remember a certain Student (ſtout hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted enough otherwiſe) Who being by a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon to be let blood (in my preſence, and at my command) as the Surgeon was about according to the cuſtom to bind his Arm, and began but to move his Inſtrument to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the vein, he fainted away, and fell from the ſeat wherein he was ſitting, before ever the Lancet was put neer unto his Arm, whenas Nevertheleſs he had neither fever, nor any other Diſeaſe that might any waies cauſe and occaſion this ſwounding of his.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, and Laſtly, an Inflammation following upon a Wound may render that Wound Mortal, if it be internal. For indeed an Inflammation doth not neceſſarily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Wounds: yet notwithſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="2611" facs="tcp:49110:143"/> that in internal Wounds thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments cannot poſſibly be adminiſtred that were wont to be applied in external, if any internal part (eſpecially if it be more Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and of an exquiſite ſenſe) ſhall chance to be wounded, then a pain is excited, and thereupon an afflux of Humors, and from thence an Inflammation, a feaver, a Gangrene, and other Evils do ariſe, that deſtroy the Wounded perſon within a very few daies. And from hence it is, that the Vulgar do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in Wounds obſerve the ſeventh and the nineth day; becauſe that within theſe daies thoſe Symptoms are wont to ſupervene, and in theſe daies to bring the greateſt danger unto the ſick Party.</p>
                     <p>Some there are that add yet another Cauſe, to wit, the influence of the Stars. And ſo <hi>Franciſcus Valleſius</hi> (in <hi>his Comment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the</hi> 95. <hi>Text. B.</hi> 4. of <hi>Hippocr. his Epidem.</hi>) ſaith that the Malignant Aſpect of the Stars and Conſtellations is the Cauſe why light and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſleight Wounds are oftentimes likewiſe rendered Mortal. And the very ſame <hi>Querce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> alſo tels us (in his <hi>Third Chap. Touching Wounds made by Guns</hi>) and that for this very Cauſe the Wounds of the Head are for the moſt part wont to be Mortal, at <hi>Ferraria,</hi> and <hi>Florence.</hi> But this Cauſe is not to be admitted of; neither can there any Reaſon be eaſily rendered, why at <hi>Ferraria</hi> the wounds of the Head ſhould be mortal, and not ſo in the neer neighbouring <hi>Rhodigium,</hi> or <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And from theſe Fundamentals no doubt it is that Civilians likewiſe take upon them to pronounce what Wounds are of themſelves and in their own Nature Mortal, and what not. <hi>Nicolaus Boerius</hi> (in the <hi>place alleadged, N.</hi> 18.) propoundeth ſix Conjectures, from which it may be Collected, that the Wound was not Mortal of it ſelf, but that it was made ſuch by Reaſon of ſome accident happening thereupon. The firſt is, if the Wounded perſon died not until a longer time after then wounded perſons are wont preciſely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their Lives. The Second is this, if there were preſent no dangerous Symptoms in the beginning of the Wound; or if there were any preſent, and remained for a while, the ſick perſon notwithſtanding was not much the worſe for them, but that he was able to perform all kind of Actions in ſuch a manner as they are not able to do that are mortally wounded. For if he ſhall appear to be in a fair way of Recovery, and then afterward die, it is to be beleeved that he died upon ſome other Cauſe, and not from his Wound. All which notwithſtanding are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood only of a Wound that is not of it ſelf Mortal. The third Conjecture is, if the ſick perſon (in the Courſe of his life) were not ſo ordered as wounded perſons ought to be; but that he expoſed himſelf unto the cold Air, addicted himſelf unto exceſſive drinking, were often diſtempered with paſſions of the mind, immoderate Anger, frequent affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and overmuch addicted to Venery. The fourth, if the Phyſitians were of opinion, and that they adjudged the Wound not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; who as men experienced in their Art ought to be beleeved. The fifth is, if the wounded perſon had no Phyſitian with him; or if any were ſent for unto him, he was one altogether ignorant and unskilful; which is al one as if he had had none at all. Which yet nevertheleſs (as hath been ſaid) is only to be underſtood of a Wound not ſimply mortal in it ſelf. For if a Wound be in it ſelf mortal, albeit there were no Phyſitian ſent for, yet nevertheleſs we are not thence to collect, that the wounded perſon might have been cured. The ſixth and laſt Conjecture is, if the wounded perſon be of a ſtrong Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For in this Caſe, if due care be taken in the preſerving of the ſaid Natural ſtrength and vigour, the ſick perſon very ſeldom miſcarrieth. But if the Wound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not mortal, the wounded perſon die, and that in a ſhort time, we ought to collect that he died not of his wound, but that he died from ſome other Cauſe, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>And this is the Judgment of all Phyſitians in general touching Wounds, both mortal, and not mortal. But yet there ariſeth another Queſtion among the civil Lawyers, to wit, whether the perſon that inflicteth the Wound may be found guilty, and condemned of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide. For theſe do not only (as Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) weigh and conſider the quality and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wound, but the minde and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo of the party wounding, and other Circumſtances likewiſe; touching which we may ſee more in the Books of theſe Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>

                     <head>The Reſt of the Prognoſticks.</head>
                     <p>Now although that out of what hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ſaid may eaſily appear what is to be foreknown and foretold touching the event of wounds; yet nevertheleſs we think it not amiſs here to add ſomwhat more as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the premiſes. For although that other Wounds (beſides thoſe we have already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of) do not indeed ſuddenly deſtroy and kil the perſon; yet nevertheleſs ſome of them are far more dangerous then other; and even of theſe ſome are more eaſie, ſome more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to Cure. And this in the firſt place is to be learnt from the very ſubſtance of the part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the fleſhy parts of all other are moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="2612" facs="tcp:49110:144"/> brought together and ſodered again; the reſt, as the Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and Membranes, with more difficulty. They may be united, and made to grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again, but it will be more ſlowly. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> (in his 1. <hi>B. of the Seed, and</hi> 13. <hi>Chap.</hi>) tels us, than himſelf ſaw the Veins in the Head (and thoſe both many of them, and great ones alſo) grow again; and (in his 5. <hi>B. of the Moth. of Phyſick Chap.</hi> 7.) that he ſaw an Artery alſo united. Secondly, from the Action and Uſe of the part. For the more Noble the part is in regard of its more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Uſe, and the Action that it performeth for the good of the whole Body, ſo much the more dangerous are the Wounds of that part. And thoſe parts likewiſe that are in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual motion will not be brought to grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again but with much difficulty. And the more exquiſite likewiſe the ſenſe of the part wounded is, the more eaſily upon its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wounded there happeneth unto it a pain, an Inflammation, a Deliry, a Convulſion, and other Symptoms. Thirdly, From the very greatneſs of the Wound. And Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, From thoſe things that uſually happen and befal the Wound. To wit,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſticks.</note>1. The more Noble the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is, or which may likewiſe draw a more Noble part into Conſent with it, by ſo much the more dangerous is the Wound.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe Wounds that are in the muſcles, far from the Joynts, and the Temples, are more eaſily Cured then thoſe that are in the Nerves, Tendons, Membranous parts, and the Joynts. For the wounds of the Nerves and of the nervous parts are for the moſt part dangerous; in regard that by Reaſon of the pain, and inflammations, a Convulſion and other grievous Symptoms do eaſily happen: and therefore they require a very expert and diligent Chirurgeon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. All the Wounds of the internal parts are more dangerous then the Wounds of the external parts.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Great Wounds are more dangerous then ſmal ones, all things elſe being anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Moreover</hi> (ſaith <hi>Celſus,</hi> in his 5. <hi>B</hi> and 26. <hi>Chap.) that which may much conduce here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is, the Age, and the Body, and the order and Courſe of life, and the time of the yeer: for ſooner is Cured a Child, Youth, or young man; then one that is Ancient, and in years: and one that is of a ſtrong Conſtitution is more eaſily and ſooner Cured then he that is of a weak and infirm Body; and one that is not over fat, nor over lean ſooner then if he were one of theſe; and he that is of an intire and ſound habit, then that man that hath an unſound and Corrupt habit of Body. And ſooner likewiſe is that perſon to be Cured that is given to exerciſe, then the ſlothful and ſluggiſh perſon; the ſober and temperate, then one addicted to Wine and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Wounds are more eaſily Cured in the ſpring time, then in the Winter, or the hot Summer.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That Wound likewiſe that hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion Joyned with it, is the more dangerous. And therefore it is of the two better to be wounded with a ſharp-pointed or ſharp edged, then with a blunt and dull Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Thoſe Wounds are most ſafe, and moſt eaſie to Cure, that are made in a ſtraight and direct line; but thoſe with more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that are oblique; and thoſe moſt difficultly of all that are round and orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If a Nerve, or a Vein, or an Artery, ſhall be wholly Cut, there is leſs danger im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, then if it be cut but only in part: alwaies provided, that they are none of the more notable Veins and Arteries, and Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in the deeper parts of the Body. For if a Nerve be wholly cut aſſunder, there is then no danger of a Convulſion; which we may well fear is night at hand if the Nerve be cut but only in part. And ſo, if a principal Vein and Artery be wholly Cut, the danger of the Hemorrhage is then wholly taken away, when the Veſſel is Contracted, and drawn together: but if a Vein or an Artery be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, and not wholly cut aſſunder, very dangerous Hemorrhages do then often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ariſe. And yet nevertheleſs, if it be one of the moſt Notable and Obſervable either of the Veins or Arteries that is cut aſſunder, then that part unto which this befalleth is deprived of its wonted Native and neceſſary heat; and is ſomtimes likewiſe taken with an Atrophy.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Thoſe wounds that have paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the laſt and untmoſt term of Acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and eſpecially the fourtieth day, are not in themſelves Mortal: but if the ſick perſon die, this may proceed either from all ill diſpoſition of the Body, or elſe by Reaſon of Errors committed in the Diet of the ſick perſon, or the Phyſitians Errors in the curing thereof. Yet nevertheleſs ſuch like wounds are not Cured without much difficulty; in regard that they indicate, that there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſome grievous Cauſe, which hindereth the Conglutination of the wound.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. That wound is alwaies evil, by which there is ſomthing cut off, and by which the fleſh that is cut off from one part hangeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome other.</p>

And that the Son of <hi>Phile</hi> after a wound in his head had a Feaver ſurprizing him on the ninth day, and upon this he ſoon after dyed. And that <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ving a violent and grievous blow (by the ſtroke of an Arrow) upon the upper part of his Belly, died in ſeven daies after. And all along in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> we ſhall find, that he alſo in wounds did obſerve the Critical daies. The truth is that wounds (as wounds) have no Critical daies; ſince that a wound is a Diſeaſe without matter. But as there may happen unto it ſome certain matter (that ought to be Concocted) or ſome kind of diſturbance of the Humors upon occaſion of the wound, in this regard it may likewiſe have ſome Criſis. For even Nature her ſelf, upon ſome certain fixed and ſet daies, both concocteth that that ought to be concocted, and calmeth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the Humors. And therefore, whenſoever on the Critical daies there is no change nor alteration for the worſe, but that all things proceed in a right manner, and that the Symptoms which before were preſent are now quieted and Calmed, it then affords great hopes of a happy Cure to enſue. But if (on the Contrary) in theſe daies there ſupervene any evil, as pain, Inflammation, or Feaver; or if thoſe Symptoms that were before preſent are not leſſened, but are rather become more intenſe and greater then before, it then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth either Death, or a very difficult Cure. And it is altogether a very rare thing, that any ſuch kind of motion in wounds ever bode any good unto the party; ſince that it declareth that Nature is not able to quiet and Calm that Motion of the Humors that happeneth in a wound; but that being ſtird up and ſet on work ſhe endeavoureth the expulſion of theſe Humors either unto the wounded part, or ſome other principal part. And therefore, when any ſuch motion as this is taken notice of in a wound, rather much evil then any good at all is from thence to be preſaged. And therefore it will be to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good purpoſe to obſerve thoſe Critical daies in wounds; that ſo by them we may come to know the uſeful actions of Nature, and that ſo we may not hinder them. We are likewiſe on theſe daies to abſtain from all thoſe things that may excite any motion of the Humors on the ſaid Critical daies.</p>

                     <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of the Cure of Wounds, and firſt of all, touching the Indications.</head>
                  <p>The firſt and Common indication of the ſolution of unity is the uniting thereof; or, unity diſſolved ſheweth, that the parts that are ſeparated and diſjoyned ſhould again be united and brought together, ſo far forth indeed as the wound is a ſimple affect. But if there be conjoyned other Affects, whether they be cauſes, or diſeaſes, or ſymptoms, there are then ſo many indications given us as thoſe ſeveral things are that are conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Wound, and ſo conſtitute a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Affect; and theſe may be very many For ſomtimes the weapon or ſome other body ſticketh in the Wound; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it is extraneous it hath the nature of a cauſe; and (as thoſe things that are from internal cauſes, and in their whol kind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural) indicateth its removal.</p>
                  <p>If there be any of the ſubſtance of the fleſh loſt, there is then a double indication given; to wit, that which is divided is again to be united; and that which is wanting, again to be renewed. If the fleſh and the skin be brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that that is bruiſed is to be converted into <hi>Pus,</hi> that ſo it may ſeparate and fall off. And ſo likewiſe of al other affects that are conjoined with the Wound, the caſe is one and the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now we will firſt of all treat of a ſimple Wound, and the ſolution of continuity that is cauſed by a weapon; upon which there hath as yet followed no other evil: but yet becauſe that ſomtimes the Weapon, or ſome other ſtrange body inflicted with the wound ſticketh therein, we wil therefore together and at once treat of the removal of them.</p>
                  <p>But now, (as we ſaid before) the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon indication of a ſimple wound is union, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us in his <hi>Art. Medic. Chap.</hi> 90. And (as the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> hath it in his <hi>third Book of the Meth. of Phyſick, Chapt.</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) a ſimple Wound only requireth agglutinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now this Agglutination and union is the work of Nature alone; and by her oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation only the wounded parts, as likewiſe thoſe parts that are broken Hand diſjoyned, do again grow together, and are conglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But then ſince that there is required for this purpoſe a certain medium, and a glew as it were; nature for this purpoſe maketh uſe
<pb n="2615" facs="tcp:49110:145"/> of that very matter by which the parts are nouriſhed, to wit, the blood. For this blood being attracted unto the part for nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and ſticking in the pores of the ſides and the lips of the wound, is converted into a ſubſtance like unto the wounded part, to wit, fleſh; and ſo by the benefit thereof, what was diſjoined now groweth together again, and ſo of two becometh one. And this in the fleſh the <hi>Sarcopoietick</hi> faculty performeth; in the skin, the cutifique or skin-breeding faculty: and ſo in every part, Nature gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth a Medium of the ſame kind, for the Agglutinating of that which was disjoyned. And this inded albeit that it be ſolely Natures work; yet the Phyſitian in the furtherance of this work is a Servant unto Nature; and the truth is, that unleſs the Phyſitian ſtrike in for Natures aſſiſtance, ſhe is in many things fruſtrated of her end; neither can ſhe effect the intended Conglutination.</p>
                  <p>But now thoſe things that in this caſe are to be done by the Phyſitian, are reduced by <hi>Galen</hi> (in <hi>Art. Medic. Ch.</hi> 90) unto four heads. <hi>Nature her ſelf (ſaith he) cauſeth to unite and grow together again thoſe things that ſtood at diſtance one from the other, and ſhe it is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreth the priſtine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity: but now it is our part and work actually to apply and put together the extreams of the diſtant parts, and being thus brought together into one, ſo to keep and preſerve them; and thirdly to beware of this, that nothing fall into the Lips of the wound; and fourthly, our work it is to preſerve ſafe and unhurt the ſubſtance it ſelf of the part.</hi> And ſo in the Cure of Wounds, there are eſpecially four offices belonging to the Phyſitian ſpecified by <hi>Galen</hi> in the <hi>place alleadged.</hi> Firſt of all, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian is to ſee and take care, that nothing fal into the part affected, which may hinder the Conglutination. Secondly, That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams in Unity diſſolved may again be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjoyned, and put together in a due and fit manner the one to the other; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams thus Joyned together are ſo to be kept, until Nature hath done her work. Thirdly, That ſo the temperament and the innate heat of the part it ſelf may the better be preſerved, he is during the time of Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination to afford unto Nature all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary help and aſſiſtance that he can by the beſt of his skill and diligence. Unto which We may not unfitly add a fourth, to wit, that thoſe Symptoms which may, and are wont to ſupervene, may be prevented and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all thoſe things taken away which may be any the leaſt impediment to Nature in the Conglutinating of the Wound.</p>
                  <p>But now in regard that there may be a very great difference in the ſolution of Unity, theſe Scopes are not alwaies to be performed alike in one and the ſame manner in all parts. And firſt of all, for what concerneth the wounds we are now treating of, if there be any thing extraneous (as Clods of Blood, or Haires, or any thing of the Nature of any ſort of Weapons, or ſmal pieces of bones, or any thing elſe whatſoever from without) ſhall chance to ſtick in the Wound, that is to be taken forth, and extracted. For they cannot poſſibly become one, between which ſomthing lieth that is of a different kind. And indeed we are not only to draw forth of the wound (at the very firſt) all things that are extraneous, but we muſt likewiſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward take great Care, leſt that any thing from without fal into the wound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>When once all extraneous things (if any ſuch there were) are drawn forth, the lips of the Wound are then to be brought together, and Joyned cloſe the one to the other; the which how it ought to be performed, we ſhal by and by ſhew you.</p>
                  <p>The parts that ſtood at diſtance being thus Conjoyned, all the reſt of the work (to wit, that they may be united, and grow together in one,) is the work of Nature alone. For it is ſhe only that Conglutinateth theſe parts when they are disjoyned. But ſeeing that Nature in this Agglutination maketh uſe both of the temper of the part, and the innate heat thereof; we muſt therefore do our endeavour that the temper and innate heat of the part may be preſerved, or if it hath been by any means weakned, that it may be again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And ſeeing likewiſe that the matter of the fleſh (by which the parts are Conjoyned) is the Blood; we muſt therefore take eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al care, and uſe the very utmoſt of our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that the Blood that floweth unto the part affected may not offend either in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, or quality. For if the Blood be vitious, it cannot generate good fleſh. And again, if there be too great abundance thereof, the fleſh then becometh over Luxuriant and proud; and there are many Excrements ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated: if there be leſs thereof then is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, it doth not then generate and make a ſupply of ſufficient matter. And whereas the wounded part is made much the weaker both by the pain, and by the wound; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the wounded part of neceſſity there muſt be produced ſtore of Excrements, and corrupt filthy mattier: and if the <hi>Sanies</hi> and Excrements intervene in the midſt of the Lips when they are drawn together; or if that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there ſhall be any middle place between, which though it be indeed void of filth and Excrements, yet is ful of Air, ſuch a like Ulcer (I ſay) cannot poſſibly be Conglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſole Conjunction of the disjoyned and diſtant parts; but that it may unite and
<pb n="2616" facs="tcp:49110:146"/> grow together again, there is a neceſſity that it be firſt filled up with fleſh. And therefore in ſuch like caſe as this there wil be need of a ſarcotick Medicament. And ſo, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the cure of Wounds, our firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and work is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To endeavor, that nothing extraneous and coming from without may ſtick in the wound, and betwixt the Lips thereof; and that nothing be left remaining therein.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Gaping parts of the wound may be again conjoyned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That being conjoyned they may be ſo kept.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That they ſodder and grow together again, each to other.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The performing of which ſeeing that it is the work of nature, it is eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that the temper and ſtrength of the wounded part be by all manner of means preſerved.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That all the ſymptoms, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may poſſibly hinder the uniting and Coalition of the part, may be taken away, and removed. And thus, although that a wound, only conſidered as a wound, is one ſimple Affect, and ſeemeth to indicate and require one only uniting; yet nevertheleſs, the very truth is, that there are herein cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched very many indications, as before we told you.</p>

                     <hi>Chap. 5.</hi> Of things extraneous, and from without, that are to be taken forth of the VVound.</head>
                  <p>IN the firſt place therefore we muſt uſe our endeavour, that there may be nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous in the wound that may hinder the union and glutination thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt of all, the blood is not inſtantly to be ſuppreſſed; and we muſt permit whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we find ſticking in the leſſer veines cut aſſunder freely to flow forth. For ſo by this means there will both a leſs quantity of <hi>Pus</hi> be generated, and all the danger of putrefaction and inflammation be prevented. Which is likewiſe very well known by him who out of ſimple wounds is wont either to extract the blood, by ſucking it forth with his mouth, or to ſqueez it out by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the wounded part with his finger. Moreover, when there are any hayres neer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the wound they are to be ſhaven away, leſt that they fall within the lips of the wound. Thirdly, if ſand or earth, or any ſuch like thing ſtick within the lips of the wound, it is to be cleanſed away with wine. Fourthly, if there ſhal be any Clods of blood in the wound (ſeeing that they may hinder the uniting, excite pain, and putrefying may cauſe a fever) they are therefore to be wiped away with a piece of a ſoft Linen Cloth, or a lock of wool; or if need require, they may likewiſe and muſt be taken forth with an iron inſtrument. In which action not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we muſt uſe no manner of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence at the firſt ſetting upon the cure; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is all the Clotted blood at once to be taken forth, and eſpecially if a Hemorrhage be feared; ſince that the clods of blood may ſtop the orifices of the veins, and the veſſells may grow together under them: but this is to be deferred until the ſecond or third dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; when we have afterward nature her ſelf (which beginneth to expel whatſoever is extraneous) helping and aſſiſting. Fifthly, the little broken bones likewiſe (if any ſuch be in the Wound) are to be taken forth. In the firſt dreſſing nevertheleſs only thoſe things are to be taken forth that are altogether free and looſe, ſo that they may be taken out of the Wound without offering any violence thereunto: but as for ſuch ſmal pieces as yet ſtick faſt unto other bones, in theſe Natures endeavour is to be expected, and ſo it wil ſoon be ſeen whether ſhe intend to unite theſe fragments that are broken with the reſt of the bone, or elſe whether ſhe purpoſe to make a ſeparation. Sixthly, if Glaſs be broken in the wound, it is to be taken forth; and this is alſo to be done, if any other kind of Weapon, or Arms wherewith the wound is inflicted, ſtick in the Wound. But before we aſſay the extraction of the ſaid weapons we are to look and conſider, whether or no the wounded perſon be likely to live after the drawing forth of thoſe things aforeſaid. For if there be no hopes of life remaining, there is no ſuch taking forth of any thing to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, no not of the weapon it ſelf; leſt that the Chirurgeon ſhould be thought to have haſtened on the parties death and leſt the wounded perſon dye under the very hands of the Chirurgeon; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth ſometimes in the wounds of the Heart, of the Brain, (the baſis thereof eſpecially) the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> (or great hollow vein) or the great Artery. For it hath been obſerved, that ſuch wounded perſons though the weapon hath been left in the wound, have yet lived for the ſpace of a whole day; but that upon the drawing forth of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon (by reaſon of the Hemorrhage following thereupon) they have inſtantly died. But where there is any hope that the ſick perſon may be recovered of his wound, we ought then to labour that firſt of al the weapon be drawn forth. For the weapons, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe leaden bullets, although they may ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtick very long in the body: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is a very rare thing, that a
<pb n="2617" facs="tcp:49110:146"/> wound ſhould be perfectly cured, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſtil ſecretly abiding in the body.</p>
                  <p>But now to draw forth the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons aright is a thing of much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty;<note place="margin">The draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Weapons</note> and this difficulty ariſeth eſpecially from the place into which theſe weapons being thruſt into the body have penetrated. And therefore for him that wil attempt rightly to draw out the weapons forth of the body, there are two things mainly neceſſary; Firſt, wel to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and mind the ſubſtance and nature, the figure, ſituation, and connexion of each ſeveral part of the body: and then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to know the diverſity of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, from their matter, magnitude, and figure: and it is likewiſe altogether neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (in the drawing out of the Weapons) to be cautious, that the veins, Arteries, Nerves and tendons be not torn or violated. For (as <hi>Ambroſe Parry</hi> ſaith truly) it would be a thing very ſhameful, and much unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Artiſt, that the hand of the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould do more hurt then the iron weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But that the weapons may the more fitly and expeditely be drawn forth, let the wounded perſon be ſet in ſuch a poſture and figure as he was in when he received his wound. Which if it cannot altogether be done, yet lying along let him ſo be placed, that he may come as neer as is poſſible unto that figure.</p>
                  <p>Now the Weapons are taken forth in a twofold manner,<note place="margin">How many ways the Weapons may be drawn forth.</note> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by extraction, or impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; that is to ſay, either the ſame way that the weapon went in, or elſe that way that it tendeth. It is extracted the ſame way that it was thruſt in, either without making any ſection, or elſe by a ſection made in the part. For if the weapon hath not pierced very deep, if it hath not paſſed thorow the great veſſells and Nervous places; and if that either right op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite unto it, or the way that it tendeth, it hath bones, veins, arteries, or nerves; and laſtly, if there be no great fear of any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to follow upon a wide opening of the part; then in this caſe, it may be drawn back the ſame way by which it pierced into the body, and that without any ſection at all.</p>
                  <p>But if there be any danger, and cauſe to fear leſt that the body may be torn, if the weapon be drawn back the ſame way by the which it entered in; the wound is then to be dilated, either by ſection, or elſe even without it; to wit, with that inſtrument which <hi>Celſus (in his fifth Book, and Chap.</hi> 7.) calleth <hi>Ypſiloeides,</hi> or elſe with a Swans bill, or Storks bill, or ſome other dilating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to the end that the weapon may be drawnforth the more eaſily. But then, the weapon is to be drawn forth either with the Hands, (if that may conveniently be done; as when it ſtandeth out, and is faſtned in the fleſh alone:) or elſe with that inſtrument they cal <hi>Volſella,</hi> when it ſticketh deeper then that we may well lay Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; or with thoſe other inſtruments that the Greeks call <hi>Beloulca;</hi> of which ſort are the long Ciſers that are ful of Teeth, ſtraight, or a little Crooked, broad in their extream part, and likewiſe round; unto which the Chirurgeons of latter times have given divers names from their ſeveral Figures; and they call them Crows Bills, Storks Bills, Ducks Bills, and Gooſe Bills; ſeveral Figures whereof we find extant in <hi>Ambroſe Parry</hi> his tenth B. and 18. Chap. and likewiſe in <hi>Johan-Andreas a Cruce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the weapons point hath penetrated further then unto the middle part of the Member; and that the ſpace and diſtance by which the weapon is to be drawn back be greater then that which yet remaineth to be paſſed through, and that neither Bone, nor Nerve, nor Vein, nor Artery any way hinder it; it will then be more commodious (a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being made) to drive the weapon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by that part toward which it tendeth, and ſo to draw it forth by a wound new made. For in this manner it will be drawn out more eaſily, and the wound will the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be cured, in regard that now the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may on both ſides be applied. But yet nevertheleſs if the Weapon be too broad, it will not then be expedient to drawn it forth through the other part, leſt that we add unto the great Wound it ſelf another likewiſe as great. And if alſo the Weapon be thruſt in between two bones, the Members lying next unto them are to be widened (according to the uſual manner) and drawn ſeveral waies, that ſo the ſpace betwixt the bones may be the looſer and wider, for the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling forth of the Weapon thruſt in between them.</p>
                  <p>But if ſome ſmal piece of a Bone, or a Thorn, or Splinter, or any ſuch like, ſtick in the Wound (that can neither be drawn forth with the hands, nor any inſtrument,) it is then to be extracted by thoſe Medicaments that have in them a power and virture to draw forth. And for this purpoſe there are commended (by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorides,</hi>

                  <p>But if by no artificial means the Weapon (or whatſoever elſe it be of any thing Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous) cannot be drawn forth of the Wound, the whole buſineſs is then to be committed unto Nature; which oftentimes in this kind worketh wonders, as it were; and expelleth thoſe preternatural things that are thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body, by any waies whatſoever where there is any poſſibility: of the truth whereof we every where meet with Hiſtories to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (as he tels us, 5. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi>) in one that had an arrow ſhot within his Groins, took forth the Head thereof ſix yeers after. And <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> for one that had a knife run into the <hi>Spina Dorſi</hi> or Back-bone, drew it forth two years after; as he telleth us, in his <hi>firſt Cent. Obſervat.</hi> 62. The like whereunto (and a thing very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable) happened here at <hi>Witteberg.</hi> For a certain Student being wounded with a knife even to the Root of his Noſe, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Angle of his right Eye, half of the knife being by violence broken (almoſt as long as ones Finger) ſtuck there firmly fixed in the bone: which when neither the Phyſitian nor Chirurgeon took any Notice of, neither he that had given the wound would be known of any ſuch thing as the breaking of the Knife, the wound was ſpeedily conſolidated. It happened notwithſtanding, that after a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a year, the ſick perſon felt a certain pain in the upper part of his Palate, before the <hi>Columella;</hi> and afterwards there was an Ulcer opened: and yet nevertheleſs, neither the ſick perſon himſelf, nor the Chirurgeon thought any thing of the Knife that lay hid within, but haply they thought that this Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer that was opened had its original from the rottenneſs of the bone wounded. Yet a little after it ſo happened, that behind the Colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella there ſtuck forth ſome thing of a black colour, which they thought to be a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iver of the rotten bone. But the ſick perſon coming to me for advice, I commanded the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon that with his inſtrument he ſhould ſearch, to find what it was; who immediatly
<pb n="2619" facs="tcp:49110:147"/> diſcovered that it was Iron; and ſo we found that it was the point of the knife that ſtuck forth. And without queſtion the edge of the Knife by its motion had opened that afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Ulcer before the Columella. But yet nevertheleſs, although the Chirurgeon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the drawing of it forth, (the broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Knife ſtill ſticking faſt in the bones) the Knife do what he could was not by any means to be drawn forth; but that when al was done the whole buſineſs muſt be committed unto Nature; by whoſe aſſiſtance it happened, that the Knife hung forth every day more then other. At length, when the point of the Knife ſtuck forth in the Jaws al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the length of a Fingers Joynt, and that the ſick perſon manifeſtly perceived ſome ſenſible motion thereof, (which before he had not done, in regard that by degrees and inſenſibly it daily conveyed it ſelf down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which he took no notice of;) he then conceived himſelf to be in extream Peril, fearing that the Knife by reaſon of the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its point ſhould makes its way into the Bowels; and therefore with the Chirurgeon comes running unto me, to ask my advice. But then ſuddenly the broken piece of Knife being freed and ſet at liberty by its own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and falling more and more downward, the point thereof was laid hold on by the Chirurgeon, and ſo brought forth; and very little it wanted from falling into the Throat. And whereas (the bone being eaten through) a hole was left in the upper part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, which was a very great impediment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in his ſpeech, (beſides fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Medicaments, to cleanſe, and dry much) at length I ordered him a thin plate of Gold, in the form of a ſhield, which in the back thereof had ſomthing ſticking forth, and round as a Globe; this I cauſed to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for him, and then I ordered a little Spunge to be bound unto it; which ſaid plate by the Spunge being put upon the hole, and there ſticking, and ſhutting the hole, he ſpake diſtinctly enough to be underſtood. Yet notwithſtanding the fleſh began afterwards to grow and increaſe in the Lips of the Wound, (although but very ſlowly) and the hole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſomwhat narrower. After I had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with this plate, he departed hence: yet nevertheleſs the hole for the greateſt part was filled up with fleſh; and it was told me that he was now turned prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and that he could deliver himſelf very diſtinctly without that Golden Plate. And in <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> his 2 <hi>Cent. Obſer.</hi> 74. <hi>Claudius Deodatus</hi> relateth the Hiſtory of a wound, which by a ſharp Sword was inflicted upon the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> or at the top and enterance of the ſmal Guts (as all the Chirurgeons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thought, indeed; but yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Gilhelm. Fabricius</hi> denieth it, ſuppoſing the Gut Colon to be wounded, which on the left ſide is annexed unto the Reins) and that it was miraculouſly Cured. But when after this (the Wound being covered all over with a Cicatrice) the ſick perſon felt neer about the part affected a ſharp pricking pain, and a ſwelling withal, it ſo happened, that when about the end of the year he had diſpatched his affaires, and was returning homewards, in the mid'ſt of his Journey he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eaſe and empty his Belly, and then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Excrements he voided forth by the Belly the very point of the Sword that was thruſt into him. But ſeeing that now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies wounds are more ſeldom inflicted by Arrows (then in former times) therefore alſo in our daies the Chirurgical Extraction of Arrows is very rarely required: but whereas now adaies moſt Wounds are made with bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets from Guns, there is therfore a greater ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity incumbent upon the Chirurgeons of our times, that they extract and draw forth thoſe Leaden Bullets that from Guns are ſhot and ſent into the Body; touching which I ſhall ſpeak further anon.</p>

                     <p>Now touching Swath-bands, <hi>Galen</hi> (in his <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Swaths</hi>) hath written ſufficient, and indeed ſomewhat largely, and therefore for our better knowledg in this Particular, we are to acquaint our ſelves throughly with what he hath written.

For although the matter of Swath-bands may be threefold, Linen, Woollen, or Skins, yet now adaies we ſeldom uſe any other but Linen only. But then theſe Linen Cloths muſt be Clean, Smooth, Soft; which have neither any Seams or Knots ſticking forth.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing how to be inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</note>But that the Swathing may be rightly performed, it is firſt of al to be conſidered, from whence the binding is to be begun. For ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the binding is to be begun from the part affected, ſomtimes from the found place nigh unto the part affected, and at other times alſo from the oppoſite part. And then next of all, in what manner the Swathe is to be drawn about. For ſomtimes the Swathing is to be begun from one end of the Swathe, and ſomtimes from the middle thereof. And Thirdly, We are to look wel that the Swathe neither binde and preſs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the part too hard, and likewiſe on the contrary that it be not over looſe. For if it be too looſe, it will not ſufficiently keep the part together; and by its over great compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it will occaſion both pain, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation. But now that all this may be rightly performed, the uſe of Swathing will teach us. Now the Uſe of Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is twofold; one of it ſelf,<note place="margin">The Uſe of ſwathing.</note> but the other only accidentally conduceth unto the Cure. Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſidered in it ſelf maketh much for the Cure, in regard that it bringeth together the parts disjoyned, contracteth the parts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and fetteth ſtraight the diſtorted and writhed parts, keepeth within due limits the Member being ſet in its right frame, as alſo the conjoyned parts, repelleth the Humor flowing in; and if it be already flown in, it driveth and preſſeth it forth again. For in hollow winding impoſtumations the binding is begun from the very bottom, and endeth at the Orifice of the Ulcer. The extenuated parts are ſo to be bound up that the ſound parts may be preſſed together, and that the Blood may be forced unto the parts extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: which will be done, if the Swathing be begun from the ſound, or the oppoſite part; from whence toward the extenuated part it may be a little looſned; and at length rolled about after the moſt looſe manner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or neer the extenuated part. But in the parts dilated, and when there is need of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving back the influx of Humors, the binding is to be begun in the place affected, and the two or three firſt rollings about let them be cloſer and harder then ordinarily.</p>
                     <p>But by accident theſe Swathes conduce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cure, when they are ſo adminiſtred, that they may contain thoſe Medicaments that are applied for the effecting of the cure.

That the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber have a middle figure (as <hi>Galen</hi> very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten calleth it) which is without pain, to wit that in which we are both born, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to keep all our Members when we are out of Action; and in which no Muſcles at all do act; and ſuch as is equally diſtant from the extream motion of the Joynts, or their extenſions, and inflections: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Muſcles, to wit, that on one part it hath Muſcles, and the whole entir fibres thereof; and that neither a whole Muſcle, neither its fibres be diſtorted.</p>
                     <p>Now placing Conſiſteth either in repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſuſpenſion. A member is then fitly put back, when by certain props and ſtayes (as feathers, fleeces of Wool, or ſoft Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes) it is ſo born up that it is made quiet, and riſing upwards, lie alwaies equally and ſoftly, ſo that it be neither ſhaken by any motion, nor aſſaulted by any flux; or that any <hi>Sanies</hi> or <hi>Ichor</hi> be therein retained. And from hence it is that (if the thigh be broken, and bound up) <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſupporteth it with ſomthing like a Counduit pipe, (the ham being ſtretched forth) from the hip even unto the foot. Our Chirurgeons uſe to apply ſome certain props of ſtraw or of paper roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together like a Counduit pipe, and within filled up with hurds, and ſo involved and wrapt up in the extreme part of the linen cloathes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which the whole Member is firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held together, leſt that it ſhould unawares be moved.</p>
                     <p>But the Member is hung in a ſtring and ſupported thereby, when the ſick perſon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lieth down, or now beginneth to walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. For although that while the ſick party lyeth in his bed it ſufficeth if that while he is awake he have his hand ſoftly inclining upwards; yet, leſt that when he is aſleep he ſhould unawaers move it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not amiſs for him to have it hung in a ſling of a ſwathband. But it is eſpecially requiſite when the ſick party beginneth now to walk, that he carry his Arm wrapt up and hung in a ſwathe, (which the Greek Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians call <hi>Taenia,</hi> and <hi>Celſus Mitella</hi>) the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row heads wherof let them be caſt about the neck; and for the breadth of it, in that part wherein the Arm is enwrapped and born up, let it be ſo broad that it may contain the whol arm, that ſo there may be no part thereof that is not equally ſupported. And here for the more fit underpropping of the hands there is oftentimes great need of thoſe little Coffers or Cheſts, of which but even now mention was made; upon which the Hand (when it is bound up) is to be placed; and then (wich the ſaid <hi>Capſula</hi> or little cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer) it is to be put upon the ſwathband.</p>

                  <p>ANd that we may apply unto Wounds all that hath hitherto been ſaid of ſwathing in general; the Chirurgeon when he is ready to bind up the wound muſt in the firſt place be very careful in ſtanching of the blood, if it flow forth over abundantly. But ſince that there happeneth not unto all Wounds any ſuch extraordinary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable hemorrhage, (but only when the greater veſſels are Wounded) of the ſtopp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtanching of the hemorrhage we wil ſpeak more below in the <hi>fourt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>enth Chapter,</hi> And now at the preſent (as for what concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the very ſwathing it ſelf of wounds, the lips of Wounds when they are disjoyned are to be drawn together, &amp; conjoyned: &amp; when they are thus brought together they are then to be kept conjoyned; which without the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of continuity may be done two waies; either by ſwathing, or Glew, or by ſtiching, and ſodering it together <hi>per Glutinum</hi> (as they term it) which what is meant thereby, we ſhal anon ſhew you.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, as for ſwathing, this ſuiteth very fitly unto wounds that are made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the length of the Member,<note place="margin">Swathing.</note> and which are not very deep; and where we have hopes that by ſwathing alone the lips of the wound may be joyned together, there ſtitching and
<pb n="2623" facs="tcp:49110:149"/> ſewing is not raſhly to be practiſed. But now let the linen ſwathe be neither too hard nor over ſoft; the breadth whereof ought to be ſuch, that being once caſt upon the wound it may not only comprehend &amp; contain the ſaid wound, but may likewiſe comprehend ſomthing on either ſide, even unto the very confines of the ſaid wound But if the Wound ſhal chance to be longe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the binding up of the wound is then better performed by a narrow &amp; ſtreight ſwath; than is, one of about three fingers breadth. Now this binding is accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pliſhed with a ſwath of two heads, (as I may ſo ſay) or that hath a double beginning; and in Wounds that are not very long the middle of the ſwathe is firſt of all impoſed upon the oppoſite part of the wound; and the rolling of it about is begun from it, and drawn toward the Wound, and above the Wound it is ſtrained; and in this manner the lips of the Wound are rightly drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and then after this, both heads or the ſwathe are rolled this way and that way, that ſo the lower part thereof may be drawn about by the lower part of the Member; but the ſuperior by the higher part of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and all to this end that ſo the humors may the better be preſſed forth of the part affected. Let this Ligature be ſtreighter and harder above upon the place affected, then in the parts that lie neer unto it; and let it be ſuch as is neither overlooſe, nor too ſtreight. For if it ſhould be too looſe, it would not contain nor keep in the lips of the Wound being drawn together; and if it be overmuch ſtrained, it would then cauſe pain, an afflux of the humors, and an inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore let the term or time of the ſtraining be, as long as the ſick perſon can wel endure it. And in the Winter (by reaſon of the cold) the rollings and ſwathings about may be the more; but in the Summer the fewer the better, leſt that by reaſon of the many windings about of the ſwath the part affected grow over hot. The knot is to be knit a good way diſtant from the Wound, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the heads of the ſwath are to be fewed together. But now that in the greater ſort of Wounds the drawing together of the lips may be made the eaſier, the <hi>Plumaceolus,</hi> or little pillow, or linen Clothes many times doubled, but moſt commonly four dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (of all which we ſpake before) are to be adminiſtred: but according to the judgment and opinion of <hi>Avicen (in the fourth ſect. of his fourth Book, tr.</hi> 1. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 8) The trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular pillows are far more commodious; which two of them together (on either ſide one) are put unto the wound; ſo that the ſides of both of them being diſpoſed and placed according to the length of the wound, (and therefore thoſe aforeſaid pillows, &amp;c. ought to exceed the length of the Wound) may have reſpect each to other. For the ſwathe being drawn upon the Angle of the Triangular Pillow forceth forward the pillow (together with the lip lying under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath) unto the Contrary part; and (as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſpeaketh) ſtraineth together only upon the fiſſure or cleft of the wound; which would not ſo be, if thoſe pillows were four ſquare.</p>

                     <p>But now whereas in tranſverſe and long Wounds ſwathing alone will not ſuffice for the drawing together of the lips of the Wounds, and ſo keeping and preſerving them, in this reſpect therefore there wil be need of ſtitching. But ſeeing that in the Wounds of the face ſtitchings cauſe a great deformity, and in other long and great Wounds the ſtitches are oftentimes broken before the agglutination of the Wound; and becauſe likewiſe that tender bodies wil by no means away with ſewing, (which is done with the needle) therefore a certain Gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or ſtitching with gluing hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, which draweth together the lips of the Wound without any the leaſt mangling of the wounded part, or pricking of it with the needle. Now this is the proviſion that is to be made. Strong Linen Cloathes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, that are equal, ſoft, quadrangular, or triangular, or of ſome other figure, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the nature of the ſituation of the Wound and member unto which they ought to be applyed doth require; let theſe be either folded together, or ſewn (ſo as that the ſtitches may be no great eyeſore) in that part wherein they have reſpect unto the Wound; and let threads now and then be paſſed thorow them in the broadeſt places of them. Unto theſe Linen Clothes are to be faſtned little handles or loops of threads ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny double, and twiſted, and then waxed; at the ſame diſtance that the ſtitches are wont to be made, or if you pleaſe, ſomwhat a leſs diſtance. Upon this linen let the aforeſaid <hi>Glutinum</hi> be ſpread, that is made of a ſtringent and viſcous clammy Medicaments; ſuch as are, the white of an egg, Bolearmenick, Frankincenſe, Maſtick, Sarcocol, fine flour Parget, Tragacanth, Corralls, and fat Roſin, As for inſtance.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bole-Armenick, Sarcocol, Maſtick, Dragons Blood, of each two drams:</hi> Let them be mingled with the white of an Egg. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Of the fineſt Flour, and Maſtick, of
<pb n="2624" facs="tcp:49110:150"/> each half a dram; Bole-Armenick Corals, Sarcocol, of each one dram; Dragons Blood, two ſcruples.</hi> Mingle al theſe with the white of an Egg.</p>
                     <p>And if we fear that the ſaid <hi>Glutinum</hi> may be ſeparated (which is chiefly cauſed by the <hi>Sanies</hi> or thin Excrements that flow forth of the Wound) then the Roſin of the Pine, or of the Pitch Tree is to be mingled together with the reſt, theſe not admitting of any humidity. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Dragons Blood, Frankincenſe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, Bole-Armenick, Roſin of the Pine Tree, of each as much as you think fit; and let them be mingled together with the white of an Egg.</hi> The Linen being in this manner ſpread over with the ſaid Glue, and furniſhed with their little handles, two on both ſides, at the ſides of the Wound, (the diſtance of a Thumb one from the other) are ſo to be faſtned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that the handles may rightly anſwer the one to the other: and they are there to be left ſo long, until that the Glue being dried up the Linen ſtick faſt unto the Skin; which commonly is wont to be done in the ſpace of four or five hours. The Linen now ſticking faſt unto the Skin, the handles or threads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid are to be drawn cloſe together, and then tied faſt one to the other, that ſo the Lips of the Wound may be rightly united. And in this manner, without any pain at all, and without any Cicatrice and Deformity (ſuch as is wont to be cauſed by the Needles point) the Lips of the wound are drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and being thus brought together and united they are ſo kept and preſerved a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time then by that ſewing or ſtitching that is done with the Needle. The aforeſaid kind of ſewing ſeemeth to have in it this one only inconvenience and diſcommodity, to wit, that it is of little or no uſe until after ſix or ſeven hours (for ſooner then this it will not be dryed, ſo as to ſtick faſt unto the Skin:) whereupon it is, that many do firſt admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſewing, and then afterwards the glew. But the aforeſaid delay can bring no great danger and detriment along with it. And if any danger be feared, inſtead of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Glue, an emplaſter may be provided, (which ſticketh immediatly) ſuch an one as is deſcribed by <hi>Caeſar Magatus,</hi> in his <hi>firſt B. of Wounds, Chap.</hi> 59. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>The Gum of the Fir Tree, four ounces; the Liquor of the Elme-Tree three ounces; Roſin of the Pine, Greek Pitch, and Ship-Pitch, and Wax, of each one ounce; Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum, Maſtick, Tacamahaca, of each ten drams; Sarcocol, Dragons blood, Gum-Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Gum-Hedera, of each ſix drams, the Root of the greater Conſound, of round Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolochy, Biſtort, and Tormentill, of each two drams,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Gums that will away with melting are to be diſſolved over the Fire with a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which ſweateth out of the Fir-Tree; and then the reſt that are wont to melt at the Fire being diſſolved according to art let them be added, and then let them be well and diligently mingled together, that ſo they may be reduced into one Body; and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſt them altogether into an Alembick, and by the heat of the <hi>Balneum</hi> draw forth the Liquor; and when you conceive that the feces are freed from al their Watery Humor, unto theſe when they are again melted by the heat add the reſt of the powders, and mingle them together with al care and diligence; and then again deſtil them, until that all the Humor be wholly evaporated; and then (withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fire) ſuffer the <hi>Balneum</hi> to cool. For ſo it is, that the matter which is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Veſſel will become ſolid, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cerote, and it will be very tenacious; neither is it by the heat of a mans Body ſo to be melted and made thin that it forget its office and what it hath to do.</p>
                     <p>I my ſelf alſo am wont to uſe this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which may be provided with far leſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bole-Armenick, Maſtick, Dragons Blood, Frankincenſe, of each one dram; Gum Tacamahaca, two drams;</hi> And make a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which with a hot Peſtle you may ſpread upon Leather, that an Emplaſter may be made thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> hath likewiſe a peculiar manner of applying this future by Gluing. He extendeth and ſpreadeth a part of ſuch a like Cerote upon a new thin Linen cloth; and then with a pair of Cizers from this linen Cloth he cutteth off ſo many parts (of a Fingers length, or ſomwhat longer, and as broad as an ordinary point that we uſe to truſs with, but in the ends of them ſomthing broader) as the ſtitches that ſeem to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in a Wound, or not many fewer; and the firſt he applyeth in the middle of the Wound, and yet ſo, that it may ſtick only unto one ſide of the Wound in the half part of it, and that the reſt be free. Unto this, at the ſide, (but yet oppoſite unto it) he applieth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo by turns he proceedeth, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one on the right part, and another on the left: and after this, he layeth hold on the parts that are free, (and that as yet ſtick not unto the Skin,) one with his right hand, and the other with the left, and draweth them both together toward the oppoſite Lip, until that the Lips be ſo drawn together that they touch one the other: and afterwards he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth both the parts that he held in his hand unto the oppoſite lip, unto which they did not ſtick; and here he is very Curious, and takes
<pb n="2625" facs="tcp:49110:150"/> a great deal of pains to make them ſtick right on all parts: and ſo likewiſe he proceedeth in the reſt of them; ſo that betwixt one and another there is left as much ſpace as is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wont to be between the ſtit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the well experienced Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, who by his long practiſe knows well how by ſuch like Emplaſters that ſtick cloſe unto the Skin (of which there are many ſorts of them to be made) to conjoyn the Lips of Wounds; this Chirurgeon, I ſay, in almoſt all Wounds (Yea even in the very firſt dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) knows how very well to be without the ſaid ſewing or ſtitching made with the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which is both cruel, Bloody, and painful. And certainly it were far better that the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons ſhould accuſtom themſelves unto this manner of ſewing Wounds together; in regard that in the other which is performed with the Needle after a kind of Barbarous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion they oftentimes commit many Errors, whiles that in ſtitching of the wound they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite more pain then was cauſed by the wound it ſelf: and uſing Needles that are too thick they take in more of the Skin then is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and ſo often leave the Lips of the Wounds writhed, and pleited; inſomuch that the Skin is not Joyned cloſe unto the Skin, neither the Fleſh to the Fleſh; but the Skin is ſewed in the midſt between the Fleſh: or if they do their endeavor to avoid this evil they fal into another as great, by taking ſo little hold of the Skin that the Wound is left hollow, and the ſtitches within a very ſhort time break out again.</p>

There is yet another alſo, which is done by diſſolving of continuity. For not only the Ancient Chirurgeons, but thoſe likewiſe of our daies (in Wounds tranſverſe, and great, and altogether in thoſe wherein Swathing only will not ſuffice for the drawing together the Lips of the Wounds) uſe ſewing and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons.</p>
                     <p>Unto the ſtitching or ſewing of Wounds there are required three things,<note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired unto ſewing of Wounds.</note> a Needle, a Thread, and the little hollow Inſtrument, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving holes through one end of it. The Needle that is required (for its more eaſie penetration) ought to have a Triangular point,<note place="margin">A Needle.</note> (which the Curriers moſt commonly make uſe of,) indifferently thick, (that ſo it be not broken, or paſs through the more difficultly) and a little hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the Tayl thereof, that the Thread hinder it not in its paſſage forth. Moſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts require a Thread of Silk; yet nevertheleſs others reject this,<note place="margin">Thread.</note> in regard that it eaſily breaketh the Skin, and they take one of Flax, doubling it, that it may be firm and not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken. And this they will have not to be over much writhed, but waxed, equal, and of a mean conſiſtence. And when the Needle is paſſed through one lip of the Wound, it is then likewiſe to be put through the other Lip of the Wound: and leſt that the Lip through which the Needle ought in the Second place to be paſſed through, ſhould in following fal under the other, and ſo be drawn aſide too much from the other, therefore without there is an inſtrument laid unto it, which they term <hi>Cannula,</hi> or <hi>Canalicus.</hi> To wit, a little Pipe, partly Gold,<note place="margin">The Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Cannu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note> and partly Braſs, or elſe all of Silver, having holes through one end thereof, that ſo through the holes the Needle may paſs; and that the Lip of the Wound may reſt it ſelf upon the Pipe, leſt that whiles the Needle is paſſing through it ſhould be moved, and ſo not follow upon the drawing forward of the Needle and Thread. And yet nevertheleſs the Lip of the Wound may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be held together by the tops of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to wit, the fore Finger, and the middle Finger; and with the other it may be ſewed together, if ſo be that the Thread paſs through readily, which will be, if in the Tayl the Needle be hollow about the hole (as we have ſaid) and that the Thread in reſpect of its thickneſs bear a proportion with the Needle.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſewing is performed after this manner.<note place="margin">The Firſt way of ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> In the middle of the Wound (the Needle draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it a double Thread) if the Wound be great the Lips of the Wound are to be thruſt through, and a knot being tied the Thread is to be cut off a little above the knot. And then in the middle ſpaces on either ſide other holes are to be made with a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and ſingle Thread, and a knot being then likewiſe made the Thread is to be cut off; and this is to be continued, until the Lips of the Wound be rightly ſewed together. And this Suture is termed <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſa,</hi> becauſe that after every prick a knot is tied,<note place="margin">The Suture interciſſa.</note> and the Thread cut off. But we are well to look, that the ſtitches ſtand neither too wide, nor yet too cloſe; for if they be too thin, they will not rightly hold the Lips of the Wound together; and if they be over thick, they then cauſe pains and Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And therefore between one prick and another let the ſpace that is left be ſuch, that
<pb n="2626" facs="tcp:49110:151"/> the Skin may as it were follow the Needle drawing it. Some will have it, that betwixt every ſtitch there ought to be a ful Fingers breadth. But it is very ſeldom that there is need of ſo many ſtitches; neither do all Wounds require one and the ſame number of ſtitches; but according as the Wounds do gape more or leſs, ſo there will be need of more or fewer ſtitches. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it will not ſomtimes be amiſs, that not only the Skin but likewiſe that ſome of the fleſh (if it lie underneath) be taken in, to the end that the ſewing may be ſo much the more firm, and that the Skin be not broken thereby. And yet nevertheleſs we are to look well unto it, and to be exceeding Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious that the Tendons be not prickt with the Needle.</p>
                     <p>And this is altogether the moſt uſual and moſt Convenient manner and way of ſtitching and ſewing of wounds; in which (this is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be underſtood for all other caſes) this only we are yet to acquaint you with (out of <hi>Celſus</hi> his 5. <hi>B.</hi> and 26. <hi>Chap.</hi>) that the ſtitches ought ſo to be made, that the very Lips are not indeed quite to touch one the other; that ſo if there chance to be any humor gotten together within, there may be made a paſſage whereby it may flow forth. And hence it is, that the Chirurgeons are likewiſe wont to thruſt in Tents anoynted with ſome fit and convenient Unguents; that ſo the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that are wont to be gathered together in the wounded part may flow forth; and then alſo that the Medicaments may the better pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate unto the bottom of the Wound.</p>
                     <p>Indeed <hi>Felix Wirtzius</hi> rejecteth the Uſe of Tents in Wounds of the Joynts,<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Tents.</note> and of the Hands, in his <hi>ſecond B.</hi> of <hi>Chirurgery,</hi> and 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> But <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> upon very good ground refuteth this Opinion, in his 4. <hi>Cent. Obſervat.</hi> 76. and by four Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he proveth the ſame to be both abſurd and dangerous. The Firſt Example is of a certain Citizen of <hi>Colen,</hi> who neglecting theſe Tents, a Wound that he had received in his Hand cloſed up in the ſuperſicies thereof; whereupon about the fourth day a great pain aroſe, which was followed by a Feaver, an Inflammation, and a <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> ſo that the Hand was in many places exulcerated; and it was not to be reſtored again without much labor and long time.</p>
                     <p>The Second Example is of a Citizen of <hi>Lauſanna,</hi> who pricked the hollow of his Hand with a Pen-knife. And becauſe the Chirurgeon (by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the Wound) could not by Tents keep it open, there followed thereupon moſt grievous Symptoms; and the ſick perſon could hardly be reſtored to his former ſoundneſs until he had long endured much Pain and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The Third is of a certain Country Woman, one <hi>Hildena</hi> by Name, who with a Thorn prickt the very tip of her fore Finger. But when as (for the cauſe aforeſaid) the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Wound had cloſed up, and the <hi>Pus</hi> or filthy corrupt mattier was gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about the Nervous parts, there aroſe a great pain; and upon this there ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an Inflammation and a Gangrene, and from thence a <hi>Sphacelus.</hi> And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Woman (having had her Finger cut off even unto the Hand-Wriſt) at length recovered.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Example is of a certain Boor nigh unto <hi>Lauſanna,</hi> who had a Thorn run into his Ankle-bone. But he neglecting the ſame, and the Orifice of the part where the Thorn went in ſhutting up too ſoon, there aroſe firſt a pain; and then there followed ſoon after an Inflammation and a Gangrene; and at length a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> invaded and ſeized upon his whol Leg: and refuſing to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that the Leg ſhould be cut off, he died within few daies after.</p>
                     <p>It appeareth therefore from theſe Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that Narrow Wounds (albeit they are in the Nervous parts) are ſo long to be kept open, until the Wound ſhall be ſufficiently purged. For ſo it is that in every Wound whatſoever there wil get together more or leſs of this <hi>Pus</hi> or purulent mattier, (as we ſhal afterward more fully ſhew you) and this, if there be not opened for it a paſſage forth, muſt needs be there reteined; and this by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little groweth hot, and becometh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp; whereupon in the wounded part (eſpecially if it be Nervous) there followeth a pain, which by attracting the Blood and the Humors exciteth and cauſeth moſt grievous Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>And yet nevertheleſs <hi>Fabricius</hi> here adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that the Tents are with ſuch Art and induſtry ſo to be ſitted and fabricated, that at the leaſt they may hold together the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſuperficies of the Wound, until the reſt of the wounded parts (to wit, the Fleſh, and the Nerves) be ſufficiently purged; and yet ſo, that they may not by any means hurt the Nervous parts. And that therefore the depth of the Wound is diligently to be obſerved; and great care to be taken, that the edge of the Tent (and more eſpecially if either a Nerve, or any thing Nervous be diſcovered and laid open) preſs not together the bottom of the Wound. But now in thoſe Wounds that are ſo narrow that they will not receive
<pb n="2627" facs="tcp:49110:151"/> in any Tent that is thick, and that that is ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and weak (as that which is over flexible) is turned this way and that way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot reach unto the very bottom of the Wound; in this Caſe he tels us that his cuſtom was to impoſe a piece of a Gold or Silver thread, (as long as the Wound was deep) wrapt up in fine Linen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſome Anodyne and Digeſtive Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</p>
                     <p>When the Lips of the Wound ſhall in this manner be conjoyned, they are wont com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly (and indeed not amiſs) to impoſe the white of an Egg well ſhaken together, and put into hurds, with this following pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Frankincenſe two parts, and Dragons Blood one Part;</hi> And make a Powder. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bole-Armenick and Terra Sigillat. of each ſix drams; Frankincenſe, Maſtick, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocol, of each two drams and half; Myrrh and Aloes, one dram and half; Tragacanth, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons Blood, of each one dram; Barley Meal, and Bran Meal, of each half a dram.</hi> Make hereof a Powder, and mingle the ſame with the white of an Egg ſhaken together, and put upon hurds, and ſo impoſed upon the wound; upon which alſo other hurds that is only wet with the white of an Egg is to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>Neither is this Medicament adminiſtred but for very good Reaſon; ſince that it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the Flux of Blood, aſſwageth pain, and preventeth Inflammation, But now if there be no fear at all of any ſuch exceſſive Flux of the Blood, or of any afflux of the Humors, we ſhal not then need to make any ſuch proviſion againſt it; ſeeing that the Hurds and thoſe Medicaments ſtick ſo Tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly unto the part, that being throughly dried on they contract the ſaid part, cauſing great trouble unto the ſame; and when they come to be removed they excite much pain.</p>
                     <p>And now although that what we have already ſaid might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,<note place="margin">Other waies of Sewing of Wounds.</note> as touching the ſtitching or ſewing of Wounds; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we think it not amiſs here further like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to add ſome other waies of the Sewing of Wounds, as we meet with them in ſeveral Authors. For there is moreover another manner alſo of ſewing of Wounds; which is indeed performed altogether in like ſort as Leather-dreſſers are wont to ſew their Skins together; and this is then only fit when the Inteſtines are wounded and the Veins and Arteries cut aſſunder.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another way of Sewing them, which is done with two Needles: and this way <hi>Celſus</hi> uſed, and deſcribeth it in his 7. <hi>B.</hi> and 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> where you may ſee it fully ſet down.</p>
                     <p>There is among the Ancients mention made likewiſe of But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons:<note place="margin">The Buttons of VVounds.</note> For (as <hi>Celſus</hi> writeth in his 5. <hi>B.</hi> and 26. <hi>Chap.</hi>) if the Wound be in the Fleſh, ſo that it gape, and that the ſides thereof cannot eaſily be drawn together into one, then fewing is improper, and in this caſe buttons are to be impoſed (the Greeks call them <hi>Agcterae</hi>) that may on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a little contract the ſides, to the end that afterwards the Cicatrice may be the leſs broad. And becauſe that the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Uniting the ſides of the Wound by but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons was generally ſo wel known unto them; from thence it was, that neither the matter of theſe buttons, neither the form of them was ever ſufficiently deſcribed by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, <hi>Guido</hi> (whom many follow) writeth that theſe buttons were made of Iron Circles as it were, or Semicircles, a little crooking on either part; the hooks whereof being on both ſides fixed and faſtened within the Lips of the Wound did anſwer exactly the one to the other. But ſeeing that in this manner to faſten in ſuch hooks as theſe, and being ſo faſtened there to keep them in the Skin, and eſpecially the Fleſh that is ſo ſenſible, was nothing elſe but a keeping there of ſo many pricking ſharp-pointed Needles as it were, with an intolerable pain; it it not therefore Credible that the Ancients by Buttons do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any ſuch Iron Inſtrument, to be faſtened within the Skin, and there exciting pains that were not to be endured. The Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Gabriel Fallopius</hi> is far more prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able who (in his <hi>Tract of Wounds in Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Chap.</hi> 12.) tels us that the Button was that kind of ſewing that above we called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terciſa,</hi> and which at this day is in very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Uſe; in the which both the Lips of the Wound are by a Needle drawing after it a double Thread thruſt through; and upon the Wound with three turnings in both the Heads of the Thread are drawn together; and tied up into a knot. And although that in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors there be mention made of Gold and Iron Buttons; yet notwithſtanding we are here to know, that the Word Button is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral word, and ſignifyeth every Inſtrument whatſoever that Joyneth and keepeth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any things unto which they are applied. And ſo <hi>Caeſar</hi> (in the 4. <hi>B. of his Warrs</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>) ſpeaketh of Beams or Rafters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with Buttons.</p>
                     <p>There was yet (as we read) another way among the Ancients of ſewing and ſtitching of Wounds; (but this they thought not ſo convenient, and therefore it ſoon ceaſed as to the uſe thereof) in the which they on both
<pb n="2628" facs="tcp:49110:152"/> ſides thruſt through the Lips of the Wound ſo many Needles drawing Threads as they thought neceſſary for the Conjunction of the Wound; and then after this above the Wound they woon'd a Thread about both ends of the Needle; in the very ſame manner as Women (when they intend to keep their Needles in the Garments they are making) rowl together their Threads about both the ends thereof.</p>
                     <p>As touching the binding up of wounds, this is likewiſe to be obſerved; that we make an exact enquiry, whether the Wound be a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or ſingle one, or elſe whether it be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, and manifold. For it ſomtimes ſo happeneth, that although there be but one Wound in the Skin, yet notwithſtanding in the Muſcles under the Skin there are two or three. For if this ſhould ſo chance, and that the Chirurgeon ſhould Cure only one of the Wounds, and altogether neglect the other that lieth hid, then will <hi>Pus</hi> get together in that other wound, and there cauſe great pain, Inflammation, Feaver, and other grievous Symptoms. Of the truth of which <hi>Gulielm. Fabricius</hi> (in his 4. <hi>Cent. Obſervat.</hi> 84. and 85.) giveth us two remarkable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories. Where he likewiſe teacheth us, that the hollow nook that lieth hid may be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and there he alſo deſcribeth, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delineateth unto our view thoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are fit and requiſite for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                     <hi>Chap. 8.</hi> Of thoſe Medicaments that are neceſſary for the Curing of VVounds.</head>
                  <p>ANd theſe are the offices of the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he ought to perform in and about the Curing of Wounds; but the very uniting and ſodering together of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded parts is the Work and Task of Nature; which oftentimes likewiſe, without any help from Medicaments, (and this eſpecially hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth in inward Wounds) agglutinateth thoſe things that are disjoyned. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince that Nature is the Efficient Cauſe of Conglutination, and Blood the matter thereof, it is neceſſary that theſe two be rightly diſpoſed, and in a due temper. For firſt of all, the truth is, ſince that the faculty is not indeed hurt in it ſelf, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may be fruſtrated of its end, unleſs the inſtrument (which here is the temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of the part, and the innate heat) be as it ought; therefore we are to take care that the wounded part have its due and natural temper. And moreover (in the next place,) our endeavour muſt be that the Blood that floweth thereto exceed not its juſt quantity, neither be leſs then what it ought; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that it be good and pure. For the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bad Blood that floweth thereto is ſo far from being fit to Conglutinate, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it exciteth many dangerous Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. And therefore if it be impure it is to be corrected, and the vitious Humors all of them to be evacuated. And there is alſo a due and right Courſe of Diet to be inſtituted, and all ſort of meats to be avoided that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a naughty and unwholſome Juyce, from which the Blood that is generated muſt needs be vitious. When we have thus taken care in theſe things, then afterward in the curing of the Wound there are alſo two Offices of Nature. The firſt whereof is, that the <hi>Pus</hi> ſhe generateth be in a due proportion; and Secondly, That ſhe Conglutinate thoſe parts that are disjoyned. For firſt of al, (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that <hi>Galen</hi> make no expreſs mention thereof, whiles that he treateth of the curing of Wounds in the general; yet <hi>Rhaſer</hi> in his 13. <hi>B.</hi> and 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> and <hi>Avicen</hi> in his 4 <hi>Sect.</hi> and 4 <hi>B. Tract.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and <hi>Celſus</hi> in his 5 <hi>B. Chap.</hi> 26. tel us, that) there is a certain <hi>Pus</hi> or Purulent mattier flowing forth of the Ulcer ſo ſoon as it once begins to give any hopes of recovery; and therefore this <hi>Pus</hi> muſt in the firſt place be furthered in its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that then the Ulcer is to be Cleanſed and filled up, and at length after this is done the wound is to be cloſed up with a Cicatrice. And happy experience hath indeed approved of that kind of curing; and thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are for this end applied are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Digeſtives. Neither is this without Reaſon. For whenas even out of the ſmalleſt Veins (when they are cut aſſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) in the wounded part there ſloweth forth ſome of that Blood that by Nature is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to flow unto the part, for its nouriſhment, this ſticking in the pores of the part, and it being ſo that it cannot be carried unto the part whither it tendeth, it is by Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into <hi>Pus.</hi> And furthermore the very wounding it ſelf hath Joyned with it ſome kind of Contuſion, and the part diſſected is altered by the Ambient Air. And therefore there is a neceſſity that what is altered ſhould impoſtumate, and be turned into <hi>Pus.</hi> And therefore in this the Phyſitian ought to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour Nature, and to adminiſter thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that help forward that generating of <hi>Pus</hi> (theſe Medicaments they commonly cal Digeſtives) and afterwards to apply Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or ſuch as Agglutinate. But here not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Authors ſeem a little to differ in their practiſe. For ſome of them (the ſaid Digeſtives and Suppuratives being wholly neglected) preſently adminiſter thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that dry much, to wit, Balſams, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2629" facs="tcp:49110:152"/> Natural or Artificial (of which we ſhal ſpeak more hereafter) with the which they both anoint the wound al over, and inſtill it likewiſe unto the very bottom of the wound, and by Tents alſo impoſe it upon the ſame. Others there are that in the firſt place make uſe of thoſe Medicaments that further &amp; help on the <hi>Pus,</hi> which they call Digeſtives. And <hi>Hippocrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> himſelf ſeemeth to have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of both theſe wayes, when (in his Book of Ulcers) he thus writeth. <hi>Al the newer Wounds (ſaith he) as well themſelves, as the parts ſituate round about them, are but little or not at all infeſted with an inflammation if they be with al ſpeed ſuppurated, and if that the pus of the wound be no waies ſuppreſſed by ſome ſmall bone, as being intercepted thereby: or if we take care to prevent that nothing may come unto the pus but what is neceſſary, and that in as ſmall a quantity as poſſibly may be; but that we dry it as much as may be with a Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is not at al troubleſome.</hi> And expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath taught us, that in both theſe waies of curing the Chirurgeon hath attained unto his end, and what he deſired. And yet nevertheleſs, it ſeemeth not that both theſe Medicaments are to be made uſe of without any kind of difference.</p>
                  <p>For in regard that thoſe Digeſtive Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo commonly made uſe of are more moiſt, if they be without great caution and overlong adminiſtred, the matter beginneth not only to be digeſted, but alſo to putrefy; and the Wound degenerateth into a ſordid Ulcer. For ſeeing that Nature is the author both of Concoction, and alſo of the generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fleſh, the native heat and the temper of the part (Natures inſtruments) are to be preſerved; and we muſt endeavor that the medicaments may anſwer unto the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the part. And therefore although that the former way of curing may have its place in thoſe parts that are fleſhy, as being ſuch as are more moiſt, and in which there is much of the blood that is to be turned into pus ſticking in the pores of the part, which (that ſo the pain and the inflammation may be prevented) ought as ſoon as may be to be converted into pus; which work of Nature thoſe drier kind of Medicaments might more eaſily hinder yet in the parts that are more dry thoſe drier Medicaments ſeem to be more commodious and proper; which as they may preſerve the temperament of the part, ſo they themſelves may likewiſe help forward the neceſſary generation of the <hi>Pus</hi> or purulent matter. And therefore the ſafeſt way is, not alwaies to confide in one Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, but rather to compound them according to the Nature and temper of the part 3 and to mingle Digeſtives with Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and thoſe that Agglutinate; ſince that experience teſtifieth that ſuch are uſed with far better ſucceſs then meer Suppuratives; as <hi>Franciſcus Arcaeus</hi> writeth that with his Balſam or Unguent (which we ſhall anon acquaint you with) applied forthwith in the very beginning, he himſelf moſt happily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the greateſt and moſt grievous Wounds; the uſe whereof I my ſelf have likewiſe very often experienced with very happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. And therefore I will now ſubjoyn ſuch Digeſtives, which are not meer Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purative</p>
                  <p>There may then be provided Digeſtive Medicaments,<note place="margin">Digeſtives, or thoſe things that further the <hi>Pus.</hi>
                     </note> or ſuch as further the purulent mattier, <hi>of the yelks of Eggs, Butter, Oyl of Roſes, Oyl of Maſtick, Roſin of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine or Fir-Tree, Wheat flour, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and Maſtick.</hi> As,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Turpentine waſhed in white Wine, two ounces; the yelk of one Egg; Barley Meal, and Honey, of each a ſufficient quantity:</hi> And make an Unguent. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Turpentine waſhed in Wine, May But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unſalted, of each one ounce; Frankincenſe and Maſtick, of each a like ſufficient quantity.</hi> Mingle them. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Turpentine, half an ounce; Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, one dream; freſh Butter, one ounce; the yelk of one Egg;</hi> And mingle them. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Citrine Wax, one ounce; Oyl, four ounces; Frankincenſe and Maſtick, of each two drams; freſh Butter as much as will ſuffice, the yelks of two Eggs:</hi> Mingle them. Or,</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Roſes, half an ounce; Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, one ounce; the yelk of one Egg;</hi> And mingle them.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as ever there is any appearance of good <hi>Pus,</hi> the next thing we are to do, is, that we Conglutinate that which is wounded and disjoyned.</p>
                  <p>Now we are taught by <hi>Galen</hi> (in the 91. <hi>Chap.</hi> of his <hi>Art of healing;<note place="margin">The Union of the Parts how cauſed.</note>
                     </hi> and in the 3. <hi>B.</hi> of his <hi>Meth.</hi> of <hi>Phyſick, Chap.</hi> 4 that the Union of the Parts disjoyned in Wounds is wrought in a twofold manner; to wit, either by a true Union, which is by a <hi>Medium</hi> of the ſame kind, and not by the intervening of any other ſubſtance; or elſe by a <hi>Medium</hi> of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſubſtance. The former Union they cal a Union according to the firſt Intention; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſuch a Union is intended both by the Phyſitian, and alſo by Nature her ſelf. The other they term a Union according to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond intention; becauſe that both the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, and Nature, when they cannot attain unto what they primarily intend; they then do what they can.</p>
                  <pb n="2630" facs="tcp:49110:153"/>
                  <p>In the former manner the ſoft parts and the fleſh are united and grow together; but the hard parts in the other manner; to wit, the bones, and the Skin; of which thoſe are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a <hi>Callus,</hi> but theſe by a Cicatrice. Unto the former Union is required a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſame kind, and a ſtrong Active faculty; which in the other are wanting. For in the Fleſhy and ſoft parts there is preſent abundance of Blood; and in theſe the heat is ſtrong; and thereupon the Blood by a very ſmal alteration may be changed into Fleſh, whereby the wound may grow together. But in thoſe parts that we call ſpermatick, and the harder parts, (the Nature of which parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a far greater diſtance from blood, and the Native heat of theſe parts being much weaker) it is not the very ſame that is gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated anew, but ſome thing like thereunto. For inſtead of a Skin there is bred a Cicatrice (moſt like indeed unto the Skin, but harder and thicker then it) and inſtead of a bone there is a <hi>Callus</hi> produced. And this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Galen</hi> (as being that which is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and commonly received) I my ſelf have likewiſe followed (in the 5 <hi>B.</hi> of my <hi>Inſtitut. Part</hi> 2 <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.) and even in his very manner. But it ſeemeth altogether to ſtand in need of ſome kind of Explanation. Now this eſpecially conſiſteth in the diviſion of the part into parts Spermatick, and parts proceeding from Blood; by which it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that certain parts are generated from the Seed, and certain of them from the blood. Yea, ſome certain Phyſitians there are (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> in his 4. <hi>B.</hi> and 15. <hi>Chap.</hi>) who deny that the blood is the immediate Aliment of the Spermatick parts; but they write that there is a neceſſity, that if the blood ought to nouriſh the Spermatick parts, that then the ſeed muſt firſt be made.</p>
                  <p>But it is not my purpoſe here in this place in many words to diſcuſs that Queſtion; the which, as others, ſo <hi>Andr. Laurentius</hi> (in his 1 <hi>B. of Anatomy, Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 7.) hath ſo largely and fully controverted. I conceive this to be the truer Opinion, that the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation of all the parts in the Womb is wrought by the Formative faculty from and out of the Seed. Whereupon <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his <hi>little B. of Originals</hi>) writeth, <hi>that the Conception hath in ſeven daies all whatſoever it ought to have; all the Members, the Regions of the Eyes, the Ears, the Hands, the Fingers, the Thighs, the Feet, the Toes, the Privities,</hi> &amp;c. But now ſeeing that the Maſs of the Seed is but little, it is impoſſible that the Bulk of the whole Body ſhould from the Seed acquire that magnitude that it ought to have. And therefore afterward the parts take nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and increaſe from the Mothers Blood in the Womb; and afterward the Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th into the light, the parts are augmented from the Blood, and ſo even unto the end they are nouriſhed with the blood. Which manifeſtly appeareth even from this, that the very bones when they are at any time ſhaved yield forth Blood, which is their Aliment.</p>
                  <p>But now, that which ſome affirm touching thoſe parts we cal Spermatick, that they are nouriſhed by the Seed, is a thing moſt falſe. For how can ſo great a bulk of the Body be formed, nouriſhed, and augmented from ſo ſmal a Maſs of Seed? And then again, the Seed is no where elſe generated but in its own proper Veſſels. Yea moreover, Children (whoſe bones nevertheleſs are nouriſhed and augmented) do not generate any Seed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſufficient, what <hi>Laurentius</hi> ſaith, that the blood variouſly changed, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering many alterations, made white, and thickned, is nothing elſe but Seed. For this is moſt falſe. For neither is the Seed any where elſe generated but in its own Organs; neither are other ſubſtances Seed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that in whiteneſs they are like unto Seed.</p>
                  <p>And therefore albeit that thoſe white and more dry parts (which they commonly cal Spermatick) be generated and nouriſhed from the Blood ſuffering many Changes; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in very truth they are generated and nouriſhed from the Blood. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is true indeed that the fleſh that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated for the agglutinating of the Fleſhy part of the Wound is altogether like unto the former, as being ſuch into which the blood (by reaſon of the neer alliance of the matter, and the ſtrength of the Fleſhy parts) is moſt eaſily changed: but yet I ſhall not raſhly affirm, neither eaſily beleeve, that the Skin and the bones, and the reſt of the Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick parts may be united by any thing Heterogeneous; and yet without any abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity I think it may be ſaid, that the Cicatrice is a Skin, and the <hi>Callus</hi> a bone. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there appeareth ſome kind of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a Cicatrice and the Skin, and between a <hi>Callus</hi> and bone; yet nevertheleſs they are not of a different ſubſtance; but that diſſimilitude proceedeth from thence, that the blood needeth many and more laborious changes, that it may be made Skin, Nerve, or bone, then that it may be made fleſh; and the heat of theſe parts is the weaker, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it was weakned by the Wound. Wherfore the Formative faculty indeed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth both the Skin, and the bone, but ſuch as are not of ſo great account as are thoſe that are generated in the firſt Formation. And yet
<pb n="2631" facs="tcp:49110:153"/> in the mean time, although the Cicatrice and <hi>Callus</hi> differ ſomwhat from the former Skin and Bone, they are not for all this to be ſaid to be of another kind. And that alſo even for this Reaſon, becauſe that the Cicatrice is not at any time generated but from the <hi>Cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick</hi> faculty, neither the Callus but from the <hi>Oſſifick</hi> (or bone-breeding) faculty; and therefore hence likewiſe it is (as we told you above, in the 2. <hi>Part, Chap.</hi> 2.) that there is never any Skin generated from Fleſh; but the Skin is evermore generated from the Skin; and indeed oftentimes a very great portion thereof, as is evidently to be ſeen in the Members that are cut off. For who is it that will not rather cal that Skin with which the Fleſh of the Hand cut off is covered, then any thing diverſe and different from it? But although that the Conjoyning and Congluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Disjoyned parts be the work of Nature alone; yet nevertheleſs, that Nature may the more eaſily effect this, the Phyſitian comes in for her aſſiſtance, by adminiſtring certain Medicaments both External, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. The External are <hi>Sarcotick,</hi> or ſuch as <hi>Generate Fleſh;</hi> and <hi>Kolletick,</hi> or ſuch as <hi>Agglutinate:</hi> Touching which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready treated more at large, in the 5. <hi>Book</hi> of our <hi>Inſtitut. Part</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. But although (as there we have ſhewn you) they may be propounded as divers; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſeeing that the Conjunction of the wounded parts is wrought by means of the Fleſh; the ſame Medicament (as is there ſaid) according to the diverſity of Bodies, and difference of the wounded parts, is ſomtimes <hi>Sarcotick,</hi> ſomtimes <hi>Agglutinative,</hi> and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times likewiſe <hi>Epulotick,</hi> to wit, ſuch as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth a Cicatrice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sarcoticks.</note>But now, let us ſee and conſider, by what power and virtue thoſe Medicaments do afford any benefit in the curing of Wounds. <hi>Galen</hi> in his <hi>third B.</hi> of the <hi>Meth.</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> is very large and ful in treating of this ſubject; and there he teacheth us, that there are two kind of Excrements produced in our Bodies; the one more thin; which for the moſt part is Evacuated by inſenſible Tranſpiration, and ſomtimes likewiſe by ſweat: the other more thick, that ſticketh externally unto the Body, and ſuch as we term Filth and Naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And ſo, that which is more thick, if it ſtick in the Ulcer is wont to make it ſordid and filthy; but that which is thin maketh the Ulcer over moiſt, and ſo becometh an Impediment unto Nature in her generating of Fleſh: and therefore (as he tels us) the filth and impurities are to be cleanſed away, and the humidity to be dried up: and ſo, that thoſe Medicaments are Sarcoticks, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately heat and dry, and cleanſe away thoſe impurities without any biting, and are no waies Aſtringent: and that the end of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotick and Agglutinating Medicaments is, not to permit any humidity at all to breed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parts that are to be Joyned; as the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth in his <hi>ſecond B. of the Compoſit. of Medicam. according to the kinds, Chap.</hi> 21. And that they ought not to be Aſtringent, leſt that they ſhould drive back that which floweth in, and ſtuff in thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities into the part affected: and that they muſt not be over drying, leſt that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that that floweth in; but only moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately drying, that what floweth unto the part may grow together into fleſh. And this indeed is almoſt the common Opinion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Sarcotick and Unlnerary Medicaments.</p>
                  <p>But ſome of the latter Phyſitians tel us that this is better performed by a Balſamick vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (from whence likewiſe they cal certain Liniments that are adminiſtred for the Curing of Wounds, Uulnerary Balſams:) But what this virtue is, they do not ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain: which if it be rightly explained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Opinion will not then ſeem much abſurd. For <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us, (and ſo likewiſe other Phyſitians very frequently) that the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons pains muſt in this moſt eſpecially be imployed, that the temperament of the wounded part may be preſerved. For ſince that the Agglutination of the Wounded parts is Natures work; and that Nature, in this as in all other Natural actions, uſeth as her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument the innate heat and temperament of the part; if that be as it ought, and if it be vigorous and ſtrong, then the Curing of the Wound is happily performed; and by the benefit of this Native heat it hath been often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times known that many have recovered of the moſt dangerous wounds. But if the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the part be vitiated, and the part become weak, Nature can then neither rightly concoct the Aliment that floweth thereto, neither Aſſimilate it, nor expel the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; from whence it cometh to paſs, that there happeneth a conflux of Humors unto the part affected, that there is an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary heaping up of Excrements in the part, and from thence many Evils and Symptoms are attracted. Whereupon <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his <hi>B. of Wounds</hi>) writeth, that <hi>what is dry cometh the more nigh unto that that is ſound;</hi> and that <hi>by how much the more moiſt any thing is the neerer it cometh unto that that is vitiated, and not ſound.</hi> And therefore it ſeemeth unto me very probable, that Medicaments <hi>Sarcotick,</hi> and Agglutinative, and in a word, all vulnerary Medicaments, do indeed dry; and yet notwithſtanding that this is not the only and primary operation they have; ſince
<pb facs="tcp:49110:154"/> that many Wounds (if ſo be the temperament of the part be ſafe) may likewiſe be Cured without the help and aſſiſtance of theſe like Medicaments; and Nature of her ſelf expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe Excrements that are produced in a due and mean quantity. But it ſeemeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable unto me, that thoſe Medicaments are therefore profitable and expedient in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Wounds, in regard that they do not only dry, and conſume the over great ſtore of Humidity in the Wound; but in that they likewiſe preſerve both the temperament, and the innate hear of the parts (which ſome of the latter Phyſitians cal Balſam) by their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, neerly allied and familiar unto every part; which virtue they ſemblably term Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick. And hence therefore it is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not the ſame temperament in al the parts, and that there is a Native heat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto each part, therefore the ſame vulnerary Medicaments are not fit and proper unto all wounded parts; but ſome are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for a fleſhy part, others for a Nervous part that is wounded; like as <hi>Gum Elemi</hi> is uſeful for all the Nervous parts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo moſt fit and convenient in all Wounds of the Head, as oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have told you.</p>
                  <p>And I am the rather likewiſe perſwaded hereunto, even by this, that in Wounds (eſpecially of the Joynts, where dangerous Symptoms appear to be neer at Hand) our more skilful Chirurgeons do not content themſelves only with Unguents and Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but upon thoſe alſo they impoſe Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms with very happy ſucceſs; the which in regard they do not reach unto the Wound it ſelf, they cannot therefore throughly dry up the Excrements that are therein; but they only cheriſh and preſerve the Temperament and Native heat of the part. And I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſeen in Wounds of the Nerves, (in which by Reaſon of the weakned Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the part there hath been an afflux of Humors, and in which by reaſon of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Concoction of the Aliment thereunto flowing great abundance of Excrements have been ſtored up, the German Chirurgeons cal them <hi>das Glied Vvaſſer</hi>) that by the uſe of ſuch Cataplaſms the Wound hath been redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto a better State, and hath no longer voided forth ſo great an abundance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements. Now thoſe Cataplaſms are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and made up of the <hi>Roots of Marſh-Mallows, the Meal of Lin-ſeed, Fenugreek, Beans, the powder of the flowers of Camomile, Melilote, Betony,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding, from this that we have ſaid (to wit, that the main and chief ſcope of Vulnerary Medicaments is to preſerve and ſtrengthen the Native heat of the part,) it doth no waies follow, that by one Medicament the Wounds of all parts may be healed. But like as <hi>Galen</hi> (in regard of the dryneſs, which chiefly belongeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) according to the various Temperament of the various parts adminiſtreth various and different drying Medicaments; ſo likewiſe according to the variety of the Temperament, the temper and heat of each ſingular part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth divers Medicaments; ſo indeed, that what is fit and proper for one part may be hurtful unto another; and that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and uſeful for a fleſhy part may bring much damage unto a Nervous part. For the fleſhy parts are endued with much heat; and therefore albeit thoſe things they are Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with be not ſo very hot, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have ſtrength enough. But as for thoſe parts that are bloodleſs, their heat is much weaker, and therefore they are to be cheriſhed with ſuch things as are more hot, and then more eſpecially when they are much weakened with a wound. Yea it may ſo happen, that although in their firſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſome Medicaments may ſeem alike; yet notwithſtanding in regard of their ſubſtance (by reaſon of which ſome of them do ſooner loſe their ſtrength and virtue, and others preſerve it a longer time) they may much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; Yea they may differ in their whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and hidden property. Now that an inſtance may be given of ſuch Medicaments <hi>Galen</hi> aſſureth us, in his <hi>Compoſition of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments according to the place affected,</hi> and 1 <hi>Chap.</hi> where he inveigheth againſt ſuch as deny that there are ſuch Medicaments. But a Reaſon cannot eaſily be rendered for ſuch Medicaments; only experience teacheth us, that ſome of them are more uſeful and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the curing of wounds, then other, and eſpecially in the Wounds of theſe or thoſe parts;) although that in their firſt Qualities they differ but very little. In the mean time I am of Opinion, that the manifeſt Qualities in ſuch Medicaments that work at once from their whole ſubſtance are not altogether idle and uſeleſs; but that they are ſingularly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the drying up of that exceſſive humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that is in the Wound. And as there are Medicaments which in the propriety of their whol ſubſtance are accommodated unto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Particular parts, (as ſome to the Liver, others to the Brain, and a third ſort unto the Lungs) ſo likewiſe it is not abſurd to ſay, that there are ſome Vulnerary Medicaments that are peculiarly deſigned unto certain parts; ſome to the fleſh, others to the Nerves, and a third ſort to the Brain, &amp;c. And moſt certain it is, (as experience alſo makes it manifeſt) that <hi>Gum Elemi</hi> is ſingularly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Wounds of all the Nervous parts, as
<pb n="2633" facs="tcp:49110:154"/> alſo for the Brain; and <hi>Betony</hi> for the head, ſo that it is a thing of much concernment that in the adminiſtring of vulnerary medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments we make a due and fit choice: and not only ſo, but the Nature of the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is likewiſe ſeriouſly to be weighed; ſince that even experience tells us, that in wounds ſome certain Medicaments are more uſeful for ſome Natures, and again, that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are hurtful. And this indeed is chiefly to be diſcovered by experience, (if not only by experience:) and what <hi>Galen</hi> (in his third <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Meth.</hi> of <hi>Phyſick, Chap.</hi> 8.) writeth touching exſicating Medicaments, the ſame is alſo true concerning all Vulnerary Medicaments, to wit, that due reſpect is to be had unto the excrements, and the ſtate of the Wound. For if there be but few excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments generated in the Wound, and that the Wound be otherwiſe in a good condition, this is an evident ſign and token of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and uſefulneſs of the Medicament ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto applyed; whereas on the other ſide, if there be many excrements heaped up in the Wound, it is an evidence that the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adminiſtred was unfit and improper. In the mean time, neither are the manifeſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to be neglected; but I conceive that of them likewiſe we are to make a due and fit choice, according to the temperament of the whol body, and the part affected in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Neither are we in this to neglect, but carefully to heed the conſtitution of the Air; but in the hotter ſeaſons the medicaments may be the cooler; and the cooler the ſeaſon the hotter ought the medicaments to be that we make uſe of-</p>

                     <hi>Chap. 9.</hi> My Judgment, touching the Method of <hi>Caeſar Magatus,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Septalius,</hi> in their Curing of Wounds.</head>
                  <p>ANd thus, out of what hath hitherunto been ſaid, it may plainly appear in what manner Wounds are firſt of all to be bound up; and what ought to be the in firſt proviſion and preparation that we make for the Curing of the ſame. But how and in what manner we are further to order and handle them, I am now to acquaint you. For in very truth, the Ancients who have written of the Curing of Wounds, as alſo the Chirurgeons who have handled and healed them, do not at all differ in thoſe things that are further to be done as touching the ſame, (as we ſhall preſently ſhew you) but they all of them go almoſt one and the ſame way. And firſt of all ſome years ſince, <hi>Caeſar Magatus,</hi> Profeſſor of Phyſick in the Univerſity of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> (in his <hi>two B. of a rare kinde of healing of Wounds,</hi> in the which he hath with much diligence and accurateneſs treated of all things whatſoever that may poſſibly be ſaid of Wounds) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth us a new Method of Curing Wounds; ſuch as hath not hitherunto been attempted by any; and by which the ſaid wounds may more ſpeedily and happily be Cured, then they have been formerly by the Ancients, or hitherto by any whomſoever. <hi>Ludovicus Septalius</hi> extolleth and defendeth <hi>Caeſar Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatus,</hi> in his 8. <hi>B. of Phyſick Obſervations, and Animadverſions.</hi> There is due unto both theſe their deſerved praiſe, in regard of their ſtudy and endeavour to advance the Art and Practiſe of Phyſick, and to free the ſick from their Diſeaſes, and the long and troubleſom way of Curing the ſame. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I conceive that I ſhal not in the leaſt offend againſt the Publick, or the Private good of any, if I ſhall here in this place, without any detraction, ſet before you the Opinion of them both, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh them, and tell you my Opinion therein.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of all, <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> (in his 1 <hi>B. of Wounds,</hi> and 33. <hi>Chap.</hi>) accuſeth <hi>Galen</hi> for having forgotten and omitted an Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greateſt moment, and for being wholly taken up with other things that are of far leſs moment; and there he writeth, that <hi>Galen</hi> was ſollicitous, and troubled himſelf only with the Excrements that were bred; but as for the Cauſe from whence they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, he never ſo much as minded the ſame: and that he ſeemed to deſire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the waſting of the ſaid Excrements, but then that he took no care at all to prevent the generating of them; to wit, in a word, that he was but little careful as touching the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament and heat of the part. For if ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient care be taken for the Temperament and ſtrength of the part; he thinks that then there could not poſſibly be collected ſuch great ſtore of Excrements that might require this over curious, and indeed hurtful diligence. Now he thinketh that the heat may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Cheriſhed and Corroborated, if we prevent and hinder the diffuſing thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and that we preſerve its quality: and that the diffuſion thereof may be prevented, if we ſupply the want of that Natural Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (ſuch as is the wounded Skin) and this indeed by a Medicament that in its quality comes neer, and is a friend unto the temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of the part. For ſo both the heat is cheriſhed, and the quality thereof preſerved by a Quality that is like unto it. And from all theſe premiſes he concludeth at length, that Wounds are to be more ſeldom wiped and cleanſed then hath formerly been practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; to wit, leſt that the heat of the part be hurt by the Ambient Air; but that it ought to be preſerved ſafe under a continual Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſo Cheriſhed and augmented; and thereupon he propoundeth a new way of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Wounds; touching which we ſhall now ſpeak ſomthing. And indeed what we have already ſaid is the ſum and ſubſtance of the whol matter: but yet Nevertheleſs in regard that the Authors now mentioned do treat ſo largely touching the thing now in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall explain it a little more cleerly.</p>
                  <p>Now the State of the Controverſie is this; to wit, whether it be better once (if not twice) a day to uncover and cleanſe the Wound; and laying on new Medicaments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to bind it up; or elſe indeed not to do this above once in ſeven daies at moſt. All the Ancient Phyſitians and Chirurgeons (unto theſe very times) have followed and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the former way of Curing Wounds. And as for this latter way of Curing them. <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> (in the preface to his firſt B. of Wounds) tels us that he firſt of all ſaw it at <hi>Rome,</hi> which although that at the firſt he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, and that it ſeemed unto him to reſt and relie upon a weak and infirm Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and to have no very good reaſon for it; yet nevertheleſs, that obſerving daily the rare and wonderful Events thereof, he began with himſelf ſtrictly and accurately to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and ſearch into thoſe Foundations and Grounds upon which it reſted and relied. And there he writeth that in two things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he found this new way of Curing
<pb n="2640" facs="tcp:49110:158"/> Wounds to differ from the former common way. The firſt this, that the Wounds were very ſeldom opened: the other was this, that in this new way there was no uſe at all made of Tents and Liniments: of both theſe we ſhall now Treat, and ſpeak of them ſeverally.</p>
                  <div n="cleaning wounds" type="remedy">
                     <head>Whether VVounds be often, or but ſeldom to be Cleanſed?</head>
                     <p>We will yet notwithſtanding firſt of all propound and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you their way of Curing Wounds.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Magatus</hi> and <hi>Septalius</hi> their way of Curing Wounds.</note> If a Wound be to be Cured, that is in a Body other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſound and of a good habit, and healthful Conſtitution, (in which there is neither any great Veſſel, nor yet any Nerve hurt; but that it is ſimply in the Fleſh; and that there hath flown forth ſufficient of the Blood) they then command the Lips of the Wound to be Joyned together, ſo as that they touch one the other. The Lips being united and brought to touch, they then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſomthing upon the Wound that covereth it and ſo cheriſheth the Native heat, and withal hath a power and virtue to dry, with ſome kind of Aſtriction; to the end that ſo the Blood that floweth unto the part that is wounded (for its nouriſhment) may be throughly purged from al its ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, and brought unto a certain viſcidity or Clammineſs. And for this purpoſe, they adminiſter Roſin Turpentine, or Roſin of the Fir-Tree; unto which (if they be more ſolid) they add a certain portion of Wax, that it may acquire a Conſiſtence. They commend likewiſe for this end Tacamahaca, which that it may the more eaſily be ſpread, they ſoften it with the Oyl of the Male Balſam Apple, or of St. Johns-wort, a fourth or fifth part thereof. They commend alſo the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam of Peru, unto which (if it be more ſolid) they give a Conſiſtence by adding of Wax. They uſe likewiſe the Juyce that is contained in the ſmal Leaves of the Elm, thickned; as alſo the Cerote Barbarous (as they cal it) the Cerote Diapalma, and the Cerote of Betony with Tacamahaca: or ſome other Emplaſter made of the Juyces or Decoctions of Vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Plants; adding thereto, Aloes, Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col, Dragons blood, Roſin Turpentine, and Roſin of the Fir-Tree. Of theſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they ſpread ſomwhat thereof upon a Linen Cloth that may anſwer the greatneſs of the Wound, and may likewiſe take in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the adjacent parts; and this they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Wound. And then upon this they apply as many linen Clothes doubled or trebled, as are ſufficient for the preſerving of the Natural heat of the part, and the keeping off the injuries of the Ambient Air. And the Wound being after this manner bound up, they open it not, until the fourth, fifth, or ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even the ſeventh day; and ſo (as they write) a wound (ſuch as it may be) is now and then Cured with once binding up; and that very frequently two or three dreſſings do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And yet notwithſtanding, that the Linen when it is all foul and naſty may ſomtimes be taken off, and clean Clothes be impoſed in ſtead thereof, this they allow of; provided alwaies, that this be done without any unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the Wound. And withal they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe make exceptions in ſome certain Caſes, in which this way of Curing ſimply hath not place, (but that we ought in thoſe Caſes to uſe the old way of Curing) touching which we ſhall anon ſpeak further.</p>
                     <p>And that new way of Curing they prefer far before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer old manner;<note place="margin">Whether Wounds be often, or but ſeldom to be opened?</note> and firſt of al they endeavour to prove by certain Arguments and Reaſons that it is both more eaſie, and more ſafe: and then by certain Reaſons they impugne and oppoſe that Ancient way; and then Thirdly, they endeavour to weaken and invalidate thoſe Cauſes that are alleadged by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and whereby they ſeem to be drawn unto the more frequent opening and uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Wound; and then laſtly, they attempt the anſwering of whatſoever hath been by any objected againſt this new way of theirs: unto all which we ſhall ſpeak in order.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place therefore, that this their new way and Method is both more eaſie, and more ſafe alſo, (and by which far many more have been and may be Cured, then by the old common way) they firſt of al appeal unto experience: and in ſpecial, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus Septalius</hi> writeth, touching the Wounds of the Head; that when in a time of great weakneſs and ſicklineſs at <hi>Millain,</hi> in the ſpace of one year very many of thoſe that were wounded in the Head, and were ordered after the old wonted manner (to wit, by often opening of the Wounds, Tents, Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and more frequent Terebrations, and Scrapings) miſcarried and periſhed: and that afterwards this new way of curing being put in practiſe, to wit, by impoſing an Unguent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wound, anointing the Lips thereof with the Oyl of the Fir-Tree, and the wound only twice or thrice uncovered, and but one only Terebration (or piercing with the Wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) being inſtituted, of fourteen that were wounded in their Heads there died but only one of them. And <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> (in his
<pb n="2641" facs="tcp:49110:158"/> 1. <hi>B.</hi> and 40. <hi>Chap.</hi>) writeth, that the wounds inflicted upon the Head (with the falling in of the bone) within the ſpace of twenty daies were perfectly cured in that manner. And likewiſe that in the ſame manner, and in the ſame ſpace of time a wound of the head, with a cutting of the Membranes, was healed. And that a Wound inflicted on the Head with a Leaden bullet ſhot out of an Engine of War (ſo that the bullet pierced even to the more inward parts of the Brain before, neither could be found, or drawn forth) in thirty daies, after two or three openings and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings was perfectly Cured.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. And then in the next place, <hi>Caeſar Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatus</hi> (in his 1. <hi>Book Chap.</hi> 7.) alleadgeth theſe Reaſons, which we will briefly propound. The Firſt is, that this new way of Curing wounds doth beſt and with the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity perform all thoſe things that are required in Curing.<note place="margin">The Reaſons that moved <hi>Magatus</hi> to prefer his new way of Curing Wounds before the old.</note> To wit, as for the Native heat, that Nature uſeth (for ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, generating of Fleſh, and the glutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Wound) as its chief Agent, (and which by Reaſon of the effuſion of Blood, and the uncovering and wounding of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Covering is diſſipated and rendered very weak, and by the external Air is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and altered) is made more ſtrong and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, whereas in this new way and Method of Curing the Wounds are kept covered. For when the Wounds are but ſeldom uncovered, that Artificial Covering ſupplieth the defect of the Natural covering which is the Skin; and ſo neither the Native heat is ſcattered and diſſolved, neither is it at al altered by the Ambient Air. And for this Reaſon <hi>Septalius</hi> wondereth that <hi>Galen</hi> ſhould omit this main and principal ſcope, (which is to preſerve the Native heat) and that his care and ſtudy is only to take away the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, He therefore thinketh that Wounds are moſt happily cured in this new way of theirs, becauſe that in this way thoſe things that retarde and hinder the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wounds are ſooneſt and beſt of all turned and taken out of the way. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one main impediment (among all thoſe other that chiefly hinder the ſpeedy and ſafe curing of Wounds) is the conflux of Humors unto the wounded part; they think that that impediment is by this their new way beſt of all prevented. For ſince that the afflux is cauſed either by tranſmiſſion, or elſe by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction (by Reaſon of the pain, and heat) both theſe are beſt turned away by this their new manner of curing. For if the Wound be but ſeldom opened, the heat is then by the covering preſerved and fortifyed; neither is there any pain excited, as it is wont to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by the frequent handling and cleanſing of Wounds. For all thoſe inconveniences and diſcommodities are avoided by this new way of curing, whileſt that the part is but very rarely moved from its due and proper Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is very ſeldom looſned and unbound, ſo that likewiſe there is not often occaſion for its binding up; and (as he addeth in the 32. <hi>Chap.</hi>) if any winde or Humor diſtend the part, ſo that there be great pain cauſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, it is ſpeedily diſcuſſed by the ſtrong and more Vigorous heat.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Of all thoſe things that impede and withſtand the Cure of Wounds, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of them is the expoſing of the Wound unto the Ambient Air, by which the innate heat is altered and weakned. But now this is prevented, if the Wound be but ſeldom uncovered by opening thereof.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, whereas <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his 2. <hi>Sect. of Fractures, Title</hi> 7.) commendeth that Cure under which there is little or no impoſtumation and loſs of the bones, this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be ſo in this new way of curing: and therefore he determineth, that this is the moſt perfect: and this <hi>Magatus</hi> proveth by an example of his own; for that in this manner he had Cured Wounds of the Head (wherein there was likewiſe an extraordinary hurt of the bone, in ſo much that any one would have Judged that a great part thereof would have dropt out) without any impoſtumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and abſceſſion of the bone, or any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, He therefore thinketh that this new way of curing is to be preferred, becauſe that under it fewer Excrements are generated then under the common and wonted manner; which (as he writeth) is manifeſt by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> (in his firſt B. and 32. Chap.) bringeth this likewiſe for a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: becauſe that thoſe things that are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and ſtrangers to the Body, (and which at the firſt could not be drawn forth by the Chirurgeons, being ſuch as require the work of Nature,) may more eaſily be driven forth, if the Wounds be but ſeldom uncovered; and that for this very Reaſon, to wit, becauſe that in this new way and Method the Natural heat is more rightly preſerved, cheriſhed, and augmented; as was ſaid before in the firſt Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>And Seventhly, in the place alleadged he produceth this for one of his Reaſons; that in this his new way the virtue of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament that was adminiſtred in the firſt dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, is beſt of all continued and made to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure even unto the perfect agglutination of
<pb n="2642" facs="tcp:49110:159"/> the Wound; and eſpecially if it be of ſuch an eſſence that it cannot haſtily be diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And as for thoſe Excrements that uſually are here to be found, he thinketh alſo that it cannot be by them corrupted; ſince that the Excrements that are generated are not worth a ſpeaking of.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. They in Like manner reject the Ancient Way and Method of Curing Wound; as drawn thereunto both by experience and Reaſon. Experience indeed, becauſe that (as is ſaid before) under the Ancient way of Cure fewer Patients, and with far more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, do recover of their Wounds, then under their new way. And as for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they alleadg, they are theſe.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is this, becauſe that under the ordinary and wonted way of curing,<note place="margin">The Reaſons moving <hi>Magatus</hi> and <hi>Septa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to reject the An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient way of Curing Wounds.</note> the wounded part is expoſed unto the Ambient Air; and by it the Natural heat ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be diſſolved, offended, and weakned; and that thereupon the part is rendered the more apt and Obnoxious unto a reception of the Afflux of Humors; and the Concoction therein is leſs happily perfected; and ſo there are generated greater ſtore of Excrements, that in time prove a great impediment unto Nature in her work.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They ſay, that from this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent unbinding and looſening of the wound, the handling thereof, and the moving of the part, the cleanſing thereof, and the laying on of new Medicaments, and by means like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the new binding up, a pain is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times excited, which they ſay may very well be the cauſe of a Fluxion. For it can no waies be, (ſaith <hi>Caeſar Magatus,</hi> in his 1. <hi>B.</hi> and 32. <hi>Chap.</hi>) but that, while we handle the part, there will be ſome pain excited; and indeed the greater by how much the greater the Wound is, and the part wherein it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an exquiſite ſenſe. For we are forced in the opening of the Wound, and the new binding it up again, to move the part from its former Scituation. We take away the Medicaments, we cleanſe and wipe away the <hi>Pus,</hi> we impoſe new Medicaments, and then we binde up the Wound again: al which operations cannot poſſibly be performed without pain.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They object, that if the Wound be too often opened and uncovered there will then Exhale much of the heat and Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and laſt of all, That Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as often as the Wound is looſned and uncovered, ſo often is ſhe diſturbed, and d ſtracted from her proper work and office.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>Caeſar Magatus,</hi> (in his 1. <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>firſt Chap.</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Septalius</hi> (in the 1. <hi>B.</hi> of his <hi>Phyſical Ammad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions</hi>) after this manner endeavour to infringe thoſe cauſes and Reaſons,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Magatus</hi> his Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Reaſons of the Ancients, for their often uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of VVounds.</note> for which it ſeemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto the Ancients, and at this day doth ſeem altogether needful and requiſite, that Wounds ſhould often be uncovered, and new Medicaments impoſed and laid on.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all, this is brought for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and received opinion, that in hollow wounds there is evermore generated a double kind of Excrements, thick, and thin; as it appeareth from <hi>Galen</hi> his 3. <hi>B. of the Meth. of Curing,</hi> and 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> and that therefore we are alwaies ſo to reckon, that it ought to be throughly dried up, and wiped away; and that therefore the Wound is daily to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that ſo the <hi>Pus</hi> may be cleanſed away, and new Medicaments applied. For thoſe that were at firſt laid on cannot long keep entire their ſtrength and virtues, in regard that they are diſſolved by the heat of the part and alſo corrupted by the mingling of the Excrements. But if the Excrements be not throughly dried up, and purged forth, being reteined in the Wound they hinder the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of Fleſh, and the conglutination of the Wound; and become likewiſe more ſharp and Corroſive; Yea further, they often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a putridneſs, from whence may proceed Pains, Inflammations, Impoſtumations, Worms, and Gangrenes.</p>

                        <p>Now unto this they thus Anſwer; firſt of all, that there is no great danger threatened from the <hi>Pus;</hi> ſince that there is no necceſſity that there ſhould be any great ſtore thereof bred in Wounds, but then only when by Reaſon of the frequent uncovering of them the Native heat is debilitated. Neither is there any need (ſay they) that theſe Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be conſumed by the impoſing of various Medicaments; ſeeing that the Wounds of the internal parts, the Liver, the Lungs, the Tongue, and other parts, (in which we cannot poſſibly come to apply Tents, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niments ſpread over with unguents) they are yet nevertheleſs healed by Nature. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, (as <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> writes, in his 1. <hi>B.</hi> and 44. <hi>Chap.</hi>) it may be admitted, that two Excrements (to wit, a thick, and a thin) may be generated in the Wound; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he thinks not this a ſufficient Reaſon why the wound ſhould be often uncovered. For the thin Excrement may partly be dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by inſenſible exhalation; and partly driven quite forth of the Wound by the heat
<pb n="2643" facs="tcp:49110:159"/> of the part; and for the thick, there is ſo little thereof at the very firſt, that it needeth no at all any Medicaments to cleanſe it away; and that after in proceſs of time it is confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and becometh one with the <hi>Pus,</hi> and ſo is by Nature expelled forth together with the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, For this Cauſe likewiſe the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uncovering of the Wound is held neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in regard that there is ſomtimes need of Manual operation; ſince that in the Cavity of a Wound there may be collected many Excrements that cannot poſſibly be purged forth by any Medicaments; but they are to be cleanſed away by the operation of the Hand.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But now <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> (in his 44. <hi>Chap.</hi>) denieth this; and there determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Excrements that are bred in a Wound may partly be inſenſibly digeſted by exhalation, and partly by Nature ſenſibly expelled by the Wound, when there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a fit afflux, and this no waies hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and detained in the Cavity of the Wound.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Wounds are therefore (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common opinion) often to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that ſo according to the various State and conditions of them various and different Medicaments may be impoſed; firſt of al, Suppurating or Digeſtive Medicaments, then Abſterſive, after that ſuch as generate fleſh; (and ſomtimes likewiſe ſuch as take away ſuperfluous and proud fleſh) and laſtly; ſuch as produce a Cicatrice. Al which ſeeing that they cannot poſſibly be effected by one only Medicament, therefore the Wound is often to be opened, that ſo unto every ſtate of the wound fit and convenient Medicaments may be adminiſtred.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Unto which Argument <hi>Magatus</hi> (in his 1. B. and 44. Chap.) endeavoureth to give an Anſwer; to wit, that this is indeed neceſſary in the old way of curing, but not in his new way; as being ſuch in which the care of the Excrements is for the moſt part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto Nature her ſelf: and in his 37. <hi>Chap.</hi> he writeth that he is wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the whole work to Nature; and that it is ſufficient, that the Medicament ſerve inſtead of a covering, and diſcharge the Office there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by cheriſhing and defending the Natural heat; and that the ſame Medicament may in all Wounds undergo the Nature of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſerve inſtead thereof. And he ſaith that he himſelf hath obſerved, that Wounds have been ſuppurated, throughly purged, and filled up with fleſh, by the help only of the ordinary and common Digeſtive. Now he thinketh that the Medicaments cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this any other waies then by their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulency and bulkineſs, whiles that they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and forbid the efflux of the heat, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the part from all external injuries: but that it maketh no great matter, what quality ſhal be adjoyned unto this corpulency; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in regard that for the moſt part ſuch Medicaments are made choice of that are of a temperate heat, and moſt agreeable unto our Nature. And at length <hi>Magatus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that by any Medicament of a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient corpulency, (provided that it be not poyſonous, and corruptive, or ſo ſharp and Corroſive that it excite and cauſe a fluxion) all hollow Wounds that are curable may be cured, and filled up with fleſh.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, It is therefore alſo thought that Wounds ought often to be opened and unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; that ſo it may be known, what the effect is of the Medicament applied; and whether or no it be ſufficiently drying; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Wound be moiſt, or not, that ſo the driers may anſwer in a due proportion unto the moiſture; ſince that the more moiſt Wounds are to be cured with the drier Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments; as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us, in the <hi>third B.</hi> of his <hi>Method,</hi> and 3. <hi>Chap.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But unto this <hi>Caeſar Magatus,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Septalius</hi> give this Anſwer, that for the cauſe aforeſaid there is no need at all of this frequent uncovering of the wound, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in this new way of curing the care of the Excrements is not to be committed unto Medicaments, but unto Nature, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat; and our ſtudy muſt be only how to cheriſh this Native heat.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, And for this cauſe alſo the more often uncovering of the wound ſeemeth to be neceſſary, that the ſtate of the wound may be known; and that the Symptoms that are wont here to happen may the better be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; and thoſe things of which <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> maketh mention. 1. <hi>Praedict. Text</hi> 18. 5 <hi>Aphor.</hi> 65, 66, 67. 6 <hi>Aphor.</hi> 4. may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Unto which they Anſwer, that al thoſe things may be known ſome other way, and by other means; as namely, from the itching, the heat, the ſmel that comes from it, the beating pain, the terrible Feaver, heavineſs in the part, and the like: and that evermore the Eyes of the minde are ſharper ſighted and ſee more cleerly then the Eyes of our Body.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, And for this cauſe likewiſe the wound ſeemeth to require frequent opening, that ſo the Swaths and little Pillows, and the Linen clothes laid thereon may be wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made clean: which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his <hi>B. of the Office of the Phyſitian, Sect.</hi> 2.) and <hi>Galen</hi> (in his <hi>Commentary</hi>) do both of them ſtrictly enjoyn; in regard that the filth
<pb n="2644" facs="tcp:49110:160"/> and impurities of the Wound may excite an Itching Pain, and at length an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Unto which <hi>Septalius</hi> anſwereth, and granteth that the Swaths may indeed be changed, provided that the Wound be not uncovered.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, For this cauſe likewiſe the Swaths and coverings of the Wound ſeem to require often changing, that ſo the hurtful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations that are bred in the Wound may paſs forth; in regard that being kept ſhut in they diſaffect the wounded part, and alter the temperament thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But unto this alſo <hi>Magatus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth that there is no neceſſity that the wounded part ſhould have ſo many and ſuch Linen Clothes put upon it, neither that it ſhould be ſo cloſe and ſtrictly bound up, but that the offenſive vapors might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale, and not be ſupreſſed. And that if the <hi>Pus</hi> hath a paſſage forth, much more then may the Vaporous Excrements be ſcattered, and find a paſſage forth: and that ſhould they be ſtil kept in, yet they never bring ſo much hurt and damage as cometh by the uncovering of the wound.</p>
                        <p>But in very truth, (that I may briefly ſhew you my opinion touching this controverſie) I will not in the leaſt detract from the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe men, <hi>(Caeſar Magatus,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Septalius)</hi> men ſo Famous and Eminent, that they are not to be ſo much as named without due honor and reſpect: and yet nevertheleſs I ſhal take the liberty to ſay, that here in this controverſie they ſeem to me to ſeek (as we ſay) a knot in a Bul-Ruſh: and that there is not any ſufficient cauſe to move them to find fault with that Ancient way and Method of curing of Wounds;<note place="margin">The general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Magatus</hi> and <hi>Septalius.</hi>
                           </note> and ſo to extol this new way of their own. For firſt of all they themſelves cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that in the old way of curing (for ſo many Ages paſt) many and the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Wounds have been happily Cured. And then again, neither can they deny this, that that new way of theirs hath place only in a ſimple Wound, (the wounded perſon being of a ſound and good habit) in which there is neither any great Veſſel cut, nor yet any Nerve hurt: and we likewiſe admit the ſame for a truth. For ſuch Wounds as theſe, in regard that they have no danger at all atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, (and that they may likewiſe be Cured by Nature alone, without any help at all from Medicaments) we do no way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of either the Curioſity, or the unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable diligence of thoſe that without any urgent cauſe at all will be often uncovering the Wound, every day, not once only, but twice or thrice: and we grant alſo (as a thing very commonly known) that ſuch like ſleight Wounds (if you lay but a little Lard thereon, or ſome ſuch like thing, and with one or two bindings up) are cured of their own accord, and by the ſtrength of Nature. But on the contrary, they themſelves acknowledg (and of neceſſity it muſt be confeſſed) that there are many wounds in the curing of which there are ſo many obſtacles and hinderances in Natures way, that if they be not removed by the Phyſitian, Nature will never be able of her ſelf to unite the wound, and therefore that ſimple proviſion is not ſufficient in thoſe Wounds. And they likewiſe altogether grant and allow of an opening of the Wound, if there be any thing to be done therein that cannot be performed without a Manual oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and if there be any neceſſary Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be impoſed, and that there be danger in the omiſſion thereof, which they grant ought inſtantly to be remedied, and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all that may be. For if (as <hi>Septalius</hi> puts theſe caſes) the body be Cacochymical, or that ſome one or other of the greater Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels be cut, or a Nerve hurt; if withal the fleſh ſhall be battered and bruiſed, (which may have need of Suppuration) if the Wound hath ſo narrow an Orifice that the <hi>Pus</hi> hath no paſſage forth of it; if any bone ſhall be hurt, or any Noble and principal part unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, (ſo that there ſhall therefore be need of Manual operation;) if there ſhal be much <hi>Pus</hi> and Excrements generated in the wound; (from whence a pain, a corruption of the part, an Inflammation, and breeding of Worms may proceed) if proud fleſh ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; if there ſhall be preſent a vehement pain; if an Inflammation or a Gangrene be feared; if any ſmal bone, or any other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſtick faſt in the wound that is to be taken forth: or if (as <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> in his 1. <hi>B.</hi> and 38. <hi>Chap.</hi> puts the caſe) the fleſh groweth forth too much; if an Hemorrhage be urgent and require it; if there be nigh at hand a Gangrene and corruption of the part; if there be preſent an extraordinary putrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and naſtineſs of the part; if there be many Excrements heaped up &amp; an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the part nigh at hand; if any Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and Extraneous Body ſtick in the Wound; if an Impoſtumation follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and that there be preſent any Pain, Itching, ill ſavour, or any bones be broken: in all theſe caſes they of their own accord grant that this ſimple binding up of the wound (in this their new way) will not ſuffice, but that the other more laborious proviſion and operation of the Ancients is neceſſary, and to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="2645" facs="tcp:49110:160"/> this their new way and Method of curing.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, ſince that the exceptions are too many for the Rule, and derogate much from the ſame, I conceive that this their new way of Curing wounds is very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient, and that for the moſt part many deſtructive Symptoms and evils (if the wound be not opened until the fourth, fifth, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day) may enſue and happen thereupon. And therfore we likewiſe willingly grant, that Wounds without urgent neceſſity are not too often to be opened, and over raſhly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto the Ambient Air: and yet withal likewiſe underſtand me with this caution, that if the Wound be over ſeldom and but now and then uncovered, cleanſed, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Medicaments laid thereon, much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and danger may befal the Patient. And therefore it is affirmed indeed that this new way of curing Wounds is eaſier, ſhorter, leſs troubleſom and more ſafe then the Ancient Method: but it is not in the leaſt proved. And be it ſo, that it is leſs troubleſom, more compendious and ſhort, and likewiſe more eaſie; it cannot (this notwithſtanding) be proved, neither will it follow, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the more ſafe and ſecure way. For who is he that dareth (or can ſafely) admit of this new way of curing, in thoſe deep and narrow Wounds that are by pricking, and by Weapons that have ſharp and not thick points; and that will adventure to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto Nature ſuch a like Wound, impoſing only ſome covering thereupon, and ſo not open it before the ſeventh day? For true it is indeed, that Natures intention in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Conglutination of the Wound is at that time likewiſe right, as well as at other times and in other wounds; but it may ſo happen, that the Wound may Conglutinate in the ſuperficies, before it be conglutinated in the bottom thereof; from whence <hi>Pus</hi> cometh to be collected in the bottom of the Wound, which bringeth with it many and great dangers; and therefore ſuch a like wound is again to be opened, as ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath often taught us.</p>
                        <p>But that we may (in ſpecial) weigh and conſider the Arguments on both ſides, we wil firſt of all examine thoſe Arguments that drew thoſe eminent Men <hi>(Caeſar Magatus,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Septalius)</hi> into this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">A more ſpecial examination of the Reaſons of <hi>Magatus</hi> and <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallus.</hi>
                           </note>And Firſt of all, as for the experience they talk of; the Ancient way of curing hath likewiſe the ſame to plead for it; ſeeing that none dares deny, that infinite numbers even of ſuch as have been moſt dangerouſly and deſperately wounded have been cured thereby. And yet nevertheleſs I hinder none; but let every man conſult experience, and make inquiry, whether he can find out any thing that is better; yet alwaies provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that what he hath ſo found out may be practiſed without any damage or danger unto the ſick party. But as for that which <hi>Ludov. Septalius</hi> alleadgeth (in ſpecial) touching the Wounds of the Head, and that many (in a very ſickly time at <hi>Milain</hi>) this way recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereof; Yea, (as he writeth) more then thoſe that were cured in the former old way; he doth not here ſufficiently explain himſelf, what kind of Wounds theſe or thoſe were. For of the Wounds of the Head, it is poſſible that ſome of them may be mortal, and others of them curable. But <hi>Caeſar Magatus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he deſcribeth the qualities of thoſe Wounds in the Head, of which he bringeth a few examples; yet nevertheleſs, he doth not prove this, to wit, that thoſe wounded perſons were cured by reaſon of that new way of curing; and that they might not as wel have recovered if the old Ancient way and Method had been practiſed. For he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oftentimes very rightly inculcates, and writeth very cleerly, that it is Nature that cureth the Wound, and not the Phyſitian, or Medicaments. For if the <hi>Pus</hi> ought to be moved, this is performed by Nature; or if that fleſh be to be generated, and the broken bones to be ſtrengthened by a <hi>Callus,</hi> theſe are the work and buſineſs of Nature. If the Wound be to be Agglutinated, it is ſhe that muſt do it; and if the Excrements ought to be expelled, this is likewiſe her Office. And through the ſtrength of Nature there happen Miracles oftentimes in Wounds; Yea (as he proveth in his 37. <hi>Chap.</hi>) a ſtrong Nature wil likewiſe bear out and overcome the Errors of the Chirurgeon committed in the Cure. And ſo (no doubt) may thoſe Chirurgeons that ſtil uſe the old way and Method of curing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the like examples on their part. That Student that was run through the <hi>Thorax</hi> (his Lungs being withal wounded) of whom we made mention, in the 2. <hi>B. of our Practiſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Part. Chap.</hi> 11. and a little above, in the 3. <hi>Chap. of the Wounds of the Lungs,</hi> was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red within the ſpace of one Month: the care of which Wound (in regard that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) was chiefly to be committed to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the cure thereof to be aſcribed unto her, and not either unto the old, or the new way of Curing. And <hi>Glandorpius</hi> relateth that a Wound of the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> was in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four daies drawn all over with a Cicatrice, as you may find the relation in his <hi>Speculum Chirurgic. Obſervat.</hi> 30.</p>
                        <pb n="2646" facs="tcp:49110:161"/>
                        <p>And indeed I will (in the next place) moſt readily grant him, that thoſe frequent terebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (which ſeem ſomtimes to be inſtituted rather for the exerciſing of the Chirurgeons Body, then for any need the Patient hath of them) are not alwaies ſafe; and that they ſomtimes bring more damage then benefit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſick perſon. But yet that the Wounds of the Head are not to be uncovered before the fifth or the ſeventh day, this I ſhall not ſo eaſily grant him; ſeeing that ſuch Wounds paſs through divers parts: and heap up di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of Excrements; and for the moſt part there is Blood collected between the Skul and the Membranes of the Brain; which is therefore with al poſſible ſpeed to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated. For which cauſe the Terebration alſo and the perforation of the Skul is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſary, leſt that this Blood if it be kept in putrifie, and ſo cauſe grievous Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, Yea, and (as oftentimes it doth) bring Death it ſelf upon the wounded perſon: which may likewiſe very eaſily happen, if thoſe Wounds ſhould ſeldom be opened and cleanſed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Reaſons alleadged by <hi>Caeſar Magatus,</hi> (and out of him by <hi>Ludovicus Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talius,</hi>) are of no great moment, at leaſt they carry not that weight in them that may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the rejecting of the old and uſual way of curing Wounds. Firſt, they mainly urge this, (and indeed herein chiefly conſiſteth the very ſtrength and pith of this Opinion) that the heat of the wounded part is to be preſerved: and they accuſe <hi>Galen</hi> for that he hath omitted an indication of the greateſt moment, and that he hath troubled himſelf more then he needed in other things of far leſs moment; and about the generating of Excrements in the Wound: whereas if the innate heat be preſerved, there will be but very few Excrements bred, and thoſe that are, will be ſuch as can no waies hinder the glutination of the Wound. Where we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant, and do confeſs, that Nature as ſhe is the Curer of other Diſeaſes, ſo ſhe, is the healer of Wounds likewiſe; and that it is ſhe alone (and not the Medicaments) that by the benefit of the Natural heat doth perform this glutination of Wounds; and therefore that the innate heat, and the natural temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of the part is carefully to be preſerved and cheriſhed. And this (albeit that <hi>Galen</hi> hath paſſed it by in that place where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly treateth of the Cure of Wounds; but whether he hath therein done well or ill, I here diſpute not:) yet notwithſtanding in other places he often inculcates, that there cannot poſſibly be any curing of the Wound, unleſs the part obtain its own Natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and thoſe very Medicaments (which are called Sarcotick) are provided for that very purpoſe, the Conſervation of the heat of the part, as we ſaid before in the precedent Chap. But here two Queſtions ariſe; the firſt this, whether the natural heat be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved bettter in this new way, or in that other old and wonted Method of curing; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no there be any neceſſity that more excrements ſhould be generated in the old way, then in this new manner of curing. The Second Queſtion is this, whether the alone preſervation of the Native heat be ſufficient for the curing of the Wounds? We deny both. As for the Firſt, it ſhall be ſhewn in the following Arguments, that the more rare and ſeldom opening and uncovering of Wounds is oftentimes more hurtful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial unto the Native heat, then uſeful and ſerviceable thereto; but on the contrary, the more frequent uncovering of the Wound, (and as oft as there is need thereof) is no way offenſive unto the Native heat; and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not by reaſon of the uncovering of the Wound, but by reaſon of the debility of the heat, or the conſtitution of the part, or the Body, that thoſe Excrements are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated. For when there is blood poured forth in the Wound, from hence it is that the heat and ſpirit is diſſipated, and the part ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the weaker; from whence it is likewiſe that in the Concoction that is made in the part there are very many Excrements gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. And that ſomtimes fewer, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more Excrements are generated in the Wound, this is not therefore becauſe that the Wound is more ſeldom or more frequently opened and uncovered, but becauſe the whol Body, and the wounded part are more or leſs diſpoſed unto the generation of the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements. But as for the Second, to wit, that the innate heat alone is not alwaies ſufficient for the curing of the wound, this is apparent; ſince that there oftentimes ſo many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and obſtacles caſt in Natures way, that unleſs they be by the Phyſitian removed, and that indeed very frequently, even every day, Nature can by no means attain unto her end and drift. The <hi>Pus</hi> firſt of all, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements that are collected in the wound, are to be evacuated; and ſomtimes a paſſage forth likewiſe made for them (as oft as need requireth) by Tents; and thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that cheriſh the heat, dry up the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and hinder the generating of them, and help forward the Glutination of the wound, are often to be laid on; ſince that when they are once laid on they are ſoon defiled with the <hi>Pus,</hi> and <hi>Sanies,</hi> (that is to ſay, the thick and thinner Excrements of the wounds) and thereby weakned; and the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of them is likewiſe otherwiſe diſſipated
<pb n="2647" facs="tcp:49110:161"/> by the heat of the part. And albeit that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> (where he treateth of thoſe Medicaments that are neceſſary for the curing of Wounds) maketh no particular mention (in ſpecial) of thoſe Medicaments that cheriſh and preſerve the Natural heat, (which that he ought to have done, I deny not) yet notwithſtanding he elſewhere very frequently tels us, that the heat and temper of the wounded part is to be preſerved; and that unleſs the temper of the part be in a right frame and Condition, it is not poſſible that the Cure of the Wound ſhould ever ſucceed happily; and thoſe very Medicaments themſelves that he often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth for the drying up of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the wounds, do Cheriſh the heat: and as I ſaid in the foregoing Chap. it ſeems to me, that thoſe Digeſtive, and Sarcotick, and Glutinating Medicaments, are made and provided, rather for the conſervation of the native heat, then for the doing of any thing elſe.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Reaſon that <hi>Magatus</hi> brings for his new way of Curing wounds, is this, that there cannot be excited any Afflux of humors, ſince that in this way the heat of the part is preſerved, and that by the often handling of the wound there is not any pain cauſed that may excite a Fluxion. But (as we ſhall further ſhew you in the following Reaſon) the truth is that in this more rare and ſeldom opening of the wound the heat of the part is not better preſerved then in the former old way. But then as touching the pain that may be excited by the more frequent uncovering of the Wound, the Cleanſing and purifying thereof, the impoſing of new Medicaments, and the new binding of it up, it is the part and office of the skilful Chirurgeon ſo to handle the wounded part, that the leaſt pain (and as little as poſſibly may) be excited. Neither in the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Pus</hi> is the part to be preſſed down hard together, but the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> is moſt light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gently to be wiped away; unleſs haply the Wound be ſinuous and full of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. For in ſuch wounds the preſſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the Sinuous winding part is both uſeful and neceſſary; yea moreover, for the better preſſing forth of the <hi>Pus</hi> from the very bottom of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> there are likewiſe little pillows or Cuſhions to be impoſed. And then the benefit and commodity that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from that ſhort and momentany pain will not only countervail, but likewiſe far exceed the diſcommodity and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Neither is this that he alleadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his third Reaſon, of any weight or moment; to wit, that in this new way the wounded part is more rarely expoſed unto the Ambient Air, then in the ordinary and uſual way. For the good and Benefit that proceedeth from the Cleanſing of the Wound and the impoſing of Neceſſary Medicaments, is far greater then the hurt and damage that is brought thereunto by the admiſſion and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of the Ambient Air. And this diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity may likewiſe in great part be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if the Wound be not uncovered in a cold Air, but in that that is ſomwhat warm or temperate; and that this be no oftner done then urgent neceſſity ſhall require; and that before ever we begin to open the wound, all things Neceſſary and Requiſite for this new binding up be at hand, and in ſuch a readineſs, that the whol buſineſs may be performed with al poſſible ſpeed.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Neither is this any ſufficient Reaſon for the preferring of this new way of curing before the old, to wit, that in a wound of the head the bone that was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumated, and no hopes but that it would be loſt, hath yet in this new way been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For it is not as yet proved, that the ſame might not as wel have been in the Ancient way and Method of curing; and it is daily obſerved, that in the uſe of the old way, thoſe bones that ſeemed to be impoſtumated and like to fall out, have yet again been Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinated unto the reſt.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Magatus</hi> affirmeth, indeed, that under that new way there will be fewer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements collected then under the Ancient way: but he doth not prove this; and he evermore preſuppoſeth that the innate heat is more rightly and better preſerved in the more rare and ſeldom opening of the wounds then in the frequent uncovering of the ſame. And we grant indeed, that by the vitious and faulty concoction of the part, many the more Excrements may be bred therein; but this notwithſtanding we deny, that theſe Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proceed only from the debility of the heat cauſed and contracted from the Air; in regard that there may be very many cauſes thereof, to wit, the abundance of vitious humors in the Body, and the conflux of them unto the wounded part, ſome of the greater veſſels hurt and pouring forth much blood, a contuſion and bruiſing of the part; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, Unto the ſixth Argument we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and grant indeed, that there is alſo a more happy expulſion made by Nature of ſmal bones, and other Extraneous bodies, if the innate heat of the part be ſtrong and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous: but then notwithſtanding this is yet again to be proved; and it is not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed, that the Native heat is more right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be preſerved and corroborated in this more rare uncovering of the wound; as we
<pb n="2648" facs="tcp:49110:162"/> ſaid before, in anſwer unto the firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, <hi>Magatus</hi> alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth likewiſe this for an Argument (but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proof at all) that the virtue of the Medicament at firſt impoſed for the perfect agglutination of the Wound will the better endure and be kept intire: touching which hereafter in the cauſes for which Wounds are often to be uncovered, (in the firſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) we ſhal ſpeak further.</p>
                        <p>And now likewiſe (in the next place) thoſe Arguments for which they reject the Ancient Method of curing Wounds, are by us well to be weighed and conſidered. And as for what concerns experience, the queſtion is ſtil in Controverſie, and not as yet determined, to whether of theſe two waies the better is to be aſcribed; ſeeing that it cannot be denied that hitherto infinite numbers have in the old way been cured. And here we are to take ſpecial notice, that many things in the curing of Wounds are oftentimes attributed unto Art, and the skil of the Artiſt, that are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be aſcribed unto Nature, that is the alone curer of Wounds, as of all Diſeaſes whatſoever. And <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, (in his 1. <hi>B.</hi> and 31. <hi>Chap.</hi>) that a ſtrong and vigorous Nature correcteth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe many errors that have been by the Artiſt committed, ſleighting and overmaſtering thoſe things that might have proved prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial unto her through the ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs of the Chirurgeon: and this (he ſaith) that himſelf hath frequently found by experience, whiles of ſet purpoſe he took little pains, nor much troubled himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, as being minded and reſolved to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what Nature in thoſe ſtronger bodies was able of her ſelf to perform; and that therfore he ſomtimes adminiſtred thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments that were not altogether ſo fit and convenient, and that yet notwithſtanding the ſick party by the help and aſſiſtance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture recovered, and became ſound again.</p>
                        <p>But now as for thoſe Reaſons that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth againſt the Ancient way, the firſt of them is this; that the wounded part is too often expoſed unto the Ambient Air, from whence its heat is weakned, and ſo thereupon great ſtore of Excrements bred and treaſured up. But as for this that is ſo often imputed unto the Ambient Air frequently admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wound, and that for this cauſe alone the greater abundance of Excrements are collected, this is only ſaid, but no waies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For theſe Copious and abundant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements do not proceed from the Air, but they have other cauſes. For that ſmal and inconſiderable appulſe of the Air (which yet notwithſtanding, as I have ſaid, is by all means poſſible, and as much as may be, to be avoided, and the operation therefore to be performed in a warm place) it cannot cauſe ſo great an alteration. And moreover alſo, the Excrements are likewiſe collected, becauſe that the Blood and Humors faln forth of the Veſſels are neceſſarily conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Pus</hi> and <hi>Sanies</hi> (that is to ſay, thick and thin Excrements) although the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the part be ſound and unhurt. But that the very temperament of the part may be hurt even by the Wound it ſelf, as alſo by the cutting and opening of the Veſſels, and likewiſe by the efflux of the Blood and Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, is a truth that cannot be denied: and <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> himſelf (in his firſt B. and 9. Chap.) taketh upon him to prove the ſame at large. And this very weakning of the part (by Reaſon of the wound inflicted) and the change and alteration of the temperament, is the cauſe, that not preſently and on the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt day the <hi>Pus</hi> is generated in the Wound, but for the moſt part on the fourth day, to wit, when Nature hath recovered and gotten her ſtrength again, and the heat of the part is renewed. And furthermore, the Bodies on which Wounds are inflicted are not evermore exactly found and pure, (but oftentimes Cacochymical) albeit they may ſeem exactly ſound; which although they receive but ſome very light and ſleight wound, yet this in theſe Cacochymical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies degenerateth into an Ulcer, by reaſon of the vitious humors that abundantly flow unto the wounded part.</p>
                        <p>As for what is in the Second place objected, that from the frequent looſening of the wound, the often handling and moving of the part, a pain and thence a fluxion may be cauſed in the part affected with the Wound, unto this objection we have already before given an Anſwer. To wit, that the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and skilful Chirurgeon may very eaſily prevent the ſaid pain: and although that ſome pain ſhould chance to be excited from the uncovering of the Wound; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the inconvenience and pain that would ariſe from the reteining and not cleanſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of thoſe Excrements might prove far greater, and of a more dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Magatus</hi> (although without cauſe) feareth, leſt that in the uncovering of the Wound there ſhould happen a diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirits and Native heat. For if there be any ſuch diſſipation of the Spirits and heat, this happeneth together with the very effuſion of the blood. But then ſo ſoon as this flux of the Blood ſtoppeth, the orifices of the Veſſels do again ſhut cloſe, ſo that there needs no fear at all of any ſuch diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="2649" facs="tcp:49110:162"/> of the Spirits; and Nature being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſollicitous and careful about the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſpirit and the Radical heat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth the offenſive and hurtful Excrements and ſtil reteineth thoſe that are uſeful; as we may plainly ſee it to be done in Critical Evacuations.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, they object this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that as often as wounds are unbound and opened, ſo often is Nature diſturbed and diſtracted from her proper Office and Work. But there is no ground at all for this fear. For Nature cannot in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time (as while the Wound is opened and bound up again) poſſibly be diſturbed, unleſs there happen a very great and extraordinary alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. But it will be rather diſturbed, if the Wound be not cleanſed from thoſe Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Septa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> do not ſolidly confute thoſe cauſes by which the Ancients, and all the Chirurgeons even unto our very times, were moved and drawn unto this often opening and unbinding of Wounds.</p>
                        <p>For Firſt of all, that they determine and conclude that Wounds are therefore often to be uncovered, that ſo thoſe Excrements that are neceſſarily generated may be evacuated; this (ſay theſe) is not indeed Requiſite, and altogether needful; in regard that the thin Excrement may partly be digeſted by exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and partly be driven out of the wound by the heat; but as for the thick, (if any ſuch be generated) it is confounded and mingled together with the <hi>Pus,</hi> and ſo by Nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled together with the ſaid <hi>Pus.</hi> But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it ſelf teacheth us that this is moſt falſe, that the thin Excrement is alwaies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by exhalation; ſeeing that oftentimes we find that it rendereth the Wound excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding moiſt, and that there floweth forth great ſtore thereof. And for the thick Excrement, although it be mingled with the <hi>Pus,</hi> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is not of its own accord wholly evacuated; or if it be evacuated, it is but very ſlowly; and therefore being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it acquireth an Acrimony, and ſo cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a pain, and a new afflux; and therefore it is ſpeedily and ſeaſonably (before this ſhal happen) to be evacuated and cleanſed away; and for this Reaſon the Wound is to be unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as oft as need ſhall require. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed doth Nature her ſelf expel theſe Excrements. Nature (the truth is) doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the uſeful Excrement from that that is altogether unuſeful. But when the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are thus ſeparated, the uſeful from the unuſeful, and ſtick in the Cavity of the wound, Nature hath then no more that ſhe can do, for it is not in her power to expel them; but the Excrement either of its own accord, and by reaſon of its weight floweth forth; or elſe it is thruſt out by the fleſh growing underneath it; and this if it be not done, it is left ſtil to remain in the wound. Neither alſo can the wounded part be alwaies kept in ſuch a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, and ſo placed, that the <hi>Pus</hi> by its weight tending downward ſhould of its own accord flow forth. For all wounds whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that are inflicted in the fore parts of the Body are altogether unfit for ſuch a Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is requiſite for a Spontaneous efflux of the <hi>Pus</hi> or Noiſom purulent Mattier; ſeeing that it is no waies convenient, that the Patient ſhould lie upon his face. And ſo likewiſe the Wounds of the hinder part, although that they be ſo Scituated that the <hi>Pus</hi> may eaſily flow forth from them, yet nevertheleſs, a lying upon the wounded part is no waies fit and convenient, but painful, and troubleſom, in regard that the whole bulk of the Body preſſeth and weigheth down the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And in Wounds of the Head that pierce through the Skul, it is much more difficult to find ſuch a Scituation, that all the <hi>Pus</hi> of its own accord and by reaſon of its gravity ſhould eaſily ſlow forth, albeit the Wound be but ſeldom uncovered.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Magatus</hi> wil not yet yield for al this, but in the 33. Chapter throughout, of his firſt B. he endeavoureth to prove that it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that Wounds ſhould be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ten uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to the end that the thick Excrements ſhould be cleanſed away; &amp; he endeavoreth likewiſe to demonſtrate, that the thick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, as alſo the very <hi>Pus</hi> it ſelf, may be evacuated without the uſe of abſterſives. And firſt of all indeed he alleadgeth this out of <hi>Galen,</hi> that he writeth (in the 13. <hi>B. of his Method of Curing,</hi> and 5. <hi>Chap.</hi>) after this manner. <hi>But if there be ſome notable</hi> Pus <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſuppurating particle, it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient (as ſome do) forthwith to cut and make an inciſion, but rather we ought to attempt an exhalation by Medicaments avayleable for this purpoſe; the uſe whereof may be conjectured from the affect it ſelf.</hi> From hence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that there is no need of Abſterſives, where the <hi>Pus</hi> may be diſſipated by Diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives. But, (that I may not now diſpute this queſtion, whether or no we may ſafely and ſecurely endeavour in Impoſtumes to waſt and conſume the <hi>Pus</hi> with Diſcuſſives alone) be it ſo indeed, that this may poſſibly be done; yet (as he himſelf writeth) for the effecting of this there will be need of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that are ſtrong and prevalent, and fit for this purpoſe. But when (I pray you) ſhall ſuch like Medicaments be adminiſtred in Wounds, to the end that the <hi>Pus</hi> may be diſcuſſed? He writeth moreover, that in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumations
<pb n="2650" facs="tcp:49110:163"/> when they are broken, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Sinns;</hi> though they have been very notable, and ſuch as have ſent forth great ſtore of <hi>Pus</hi>) have been filled up with fleſh, no Abſterſive at all having been put into the Cavity thereof, but only ſome Medicament laid unto the very mouth of the ſame; of which it was not poſſible that any thing ſhould reach ſo low as the bottom thereof. But unto this I anſwer, that this is not alwaies done; but that there is oftentimes need of caſting in Abſterſive Medicaments; or if ſuch may not be adminiſtred, that then the <hi>Sinus</hi> is to be preſſed together, that the <hi>Pus</hi> may both flow and be preſſed forth; and that this is often to be done, and for this Cauſe the Wound is alſo often to be uncovered; and that the <hi>Pus</hi> is by no means to be deteined in ſuch a <hi>Sinus.</hi> And laſtly, He writeth that even internal Wounds may be alſo cured, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the impurities and Excrements there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be not cleanſed and done away. But I anſwer, that neither is this alwaies done, but in thoſe parts only in which there are but few Excrements collected, and ſuch as have an open and prone paſſage forth of them. Otherwiſe it the Excrements be long detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thoſe Wounds are not to be Cured; and this we ſee to be often done in the Lungs, in which from the Excrements retained Ulcers and at length the <hi>Phthiſis</hi> or conſumption is generated. And indeed, oftentimes the <hi>Pus</hi> and Excrements ſtick ſo cloſe and faſt unto the ſides of the Wound that they cannot poſſibly of themſelves flow forth, but that they muſt of neceſſity be cleanſed away by a manual operation.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, That therefore the Wound is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be uncovered, that ſo according to the various ſtate of the Wound, ſomtimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtives, and ſomtimes abſterſives, ſomtimes thoſe that generate fleſh, and ſomtimes again thoſe that waſt and eat away ſuperfluous and proud fleſh, may be adminſtred: unto this indeed <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> anſwereth, that there is no need at all of that change of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in regard that the whole buſineſs is to be committed to Nature. And that it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if there be only a covering impoſed upon the wound, that by its corpulency may prevent and hinder the efflux of the Radical heat, and that may preſerve and cheriſh the ſame, and that therefore with one only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament divers times a Wound may be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But here falſe Principles are preſuppoſed. The Firſt is this, that Nature of her ſelf alone is able to perform all thoſe things that are neceſſarily required for the healing of a Wound. Indeed it is true, that Nature doth concoct, ſeparate ſuch things as are of a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous and different quality, and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth fleſh; but the Excrements when ſhe hath ſeparated them, ſhe cannot alone and of her ſelf expel them; but they are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo pertinacious that they will ſt ck un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the part, do ſhe what poſſibly ſhe can. Neither do they alſo flow forth of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of their own accord; or is the Member indeed ſo to be placed, that they may of their own accord flow forth, as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before we likewiſe told you. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then in that Caſe there is need of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that may keep them from being over naſty; yea and oftentimes alſo of a Manual operation, whereby they may be throughly cleanſed. Another of his falſe Principles is this; that Nature in her work ſtandeth in no need of any Medicaments whatſoever, that ſo ſhe may be holpen and aſſiſted thereby; which that it is falſe even experience it ſelf teacheth us; wherein we ſee moſt manifeſtly that Digeſtives that in the beginning are of ſingular uſe, in the progreſs of the Diſeaſe prove very hurtful: and this <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> himſelf likewiſe confeſſeth; for in his 1. <hi>B.</hi> and 37. <hi>Chap.</hi> he writeth that he had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that by the uſe of a digeſtive the moſt grievous Wounds inflicted by Bullets ſhot from Guns have been ſuppurated, throughly purged, and filled up with fleſh; but that afterward by reaſon of the over great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity there hath grown a fleſh upon it that hath wanted Corroſives to eat it out and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it. His third principle (that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence followeth from hence) is likewiſe falſe; to wit, that one only Medicament is ſufficient all the whole time of the Diſeaſe, provided that by its Corpulency it may be unto it inſtead of a Covering. For if this ſhould be ſo, and were indeed true, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an Emplaſter we may as wel put any piece of Leather upon the Wound, or make uſe of one kinde of Emplaſter for another, ſo that it be not deadly and poyſonous, ſharp, and Corroding: and yet notwithſtanding he never as hitherto heard of any wiſe Phyſitian that ever did thus. And in this very point likewiſe <hi>Magatus</hi> expreſsly contradicteth himſelf, who (in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>6. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the ſame <hi>B.</hi>) writeth moſt truly, that not every kind of covering (how ever it be made and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) is fit for the defence and corroborating of the Natural heat; or that it is convenient for the temper of every part; and that, what is a very fit and convenient covering in one part may in another part be altogether unfit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, and indecent, yea likewiſe that it may be a very hurtful &amp; dangerous covering.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Whereas it is the common Tenet, and that we are uſually taught, that therefore likewiſe Wounds ought often to be uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſo the virtue and effect of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament may be known what it is, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2651" facs="tcp:49110:163"/> the Wound be moiſt, yea or no, that ſo Convenient driers may be laid thereto, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as there ſhal be occaſion; unto this <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> anſwereth that there is no need at all of any ſuch ado, or that we trouble our ſelves ſo much thereabout, in regard that the whol buſineſs and the iſſue therof is to be committed to Nature. But he doth not well in ſo determining. For the truth is, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth indeed evermore intend that which is beſt, but yet notwithſtanding ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alwaies obtain what it intendeth; either becauſe ſhe is weak, or elſe in regard that ſhe is oppreſſed and overwhelmed with too great an abundance of that Object on which ſhe acteth: and therefore both the temperament of the wounded part is to be cheriſhed with Medicaments, (and theſe indeed ſome at one time, and ſome at another;) and the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo by which Nature is oppreſſed and overburthened are to be dried up, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated. And therefore we conclude, that it is overraſh and altogether unſafe to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the whole buſineſs unto Nature, and to ſtand looking on as an idle Spectator; ſince that it may eaſily ſo happen, that overmuch Humidity abounding in the Wound it may ſoon degenerate into an Ulcer.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, And for this Cauſe likewiſe ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the more frequent uncovering of the Wound is held to be neceſſary, that ſo the State of the Wound may be known, and the Symptoms likely to happen thereupon may be prevented. <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> rejecteth alſo this Cauſe, and aſſerteth, that from other Signs, (to wit) Itching, Pain, and the fear ſcent that cometh from the Wound, we may give a ſhrewd gueſs; and he poſitively determineth that an Artificial Conjecture is the beſt; and that we may more rightly make our conjecture by the Eyes of our mind, then by thoſe of our Body, ſince that they are ſharper ſighted then theſe. But thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures are oftentimes very uncertain: yea ſomthings may now and then happen unto a Wound that will no way be taken Notice of but only by ocular inſpection, and ſuch are the <hi>Fungi</hi> of the Brain, Worms in Wounds and fleſh growing upon them. And though it be true that at the length there will ſome certain ſigns diſcover themſelves; yet it is no way ſafe, that the Phyſitian ſtand as an idle Spectator, until ſuch time as thoſe ſigns (to wit Pains, Feaver, Noyſom ſmels, and the like,) ſhall happen, and manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For when theſe once come upon the Patient, he is then moſt commonly in the greateſt danger; which by ocular Inſpection might have been eaſily foreknown, and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevented: and oftentimes in the ſpace of one day, yea of a few hours, ſome grievous evil may befal the ſick perſon. And ſo <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> relateth, that he had ſeen Wounds, in which (unleſs they were daily opened, and new Medicaments laid on) Worms would continually be breeding.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, And for this cauſe alſo the wound is to be frequently uncovered, that ſo the Swaths, little Pillows, and Linen Clothes; may be made clean. But <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Septalius</hi> ſleight, and account of this as of a thing of no reckoning: or if we may a any time change the Swathes, they allow it only, with this Proviſo, that the wound be no uncovered. But theſe ſhould have conſidered with themſelves, that if the Swathes be ſoul and unclean, much more the Wound, and the coverings neerer unto the ſame, muſt needs be Naſty and unclean, ſince that the ſanies or thin Excrement doth firſt and moſt of all defile thoſe things that do neereſt touch upon the Wound.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, And Laſtly, whereas even for this cauſe the more frequent opening of the Wound ſeemeth to be neceſſary (as is alſo the change of the Swathes, and little Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,) that ſo the ſtinking Vapors in the Wound, (bred of the <hi>Pus</hi> and Excrements) may the better exhale, (which if they be ſtil detained &amp; ſhut up in the wound, they affect the wounded part, and much change and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame:) unto this <hi>Septalius</hi> Anſwereth, that the Wound is not to be bound up with ſo many and ſuch Linen Clothes that thoſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors ſhould be ſuppreſſed; and if that the <hi>Pus</hi> find a paſſage forth, he thinks then that thoſe Vaporous Excrements may much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be blown abroad, and diſſipated: and if they be altogether retained that they are not likely to bring ſo much damage unto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as may befal him from the uncovering of the Wound, and the alteration of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Air.</p>
                        <p>But in whatſoever manner the Wound is bound up, (which yet notwithſtanding they themſelves grant that it ought ſo to be bound up, that it may be defended from all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal injuries) thoſe Vapors may eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, yea they may inſinuate themſelves into the Linen Clothes, and the Swathes; and hence they may offend the wounded part by their ſtench and noyſomneſs. And this is that very thing that is now in Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the <hi>Pus</hi> may be evacuated, unleſs the Wound be often uncovered. The alteration alſo that is cauſed from the external Air can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo hurtful and offenſive, (in regard that it partaketh not of any ill quality) as is that which proceedeth from thoſe putrid and ſtinking vapors ariſing from the <hi>Pus</hi> and <hi>Sanies.</hi>

                     <p>The other thing where in <hi>Caeſar Magatus,</hi> and <hi>Ludodicus Septalius</hi> diſſent from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and from other Phyſitians and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeous, is this, that they aſſert, (and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to maintain this their opinion) that there is no uſe at all to be made of Tents in the Curing of Wounds. <hi>Magatus</hi> to prove this (in his 1. <hi>B.</hi> and 5. <hi>Chap.</hi>) uſeth theſe Reaſons.</p>

And he thinketh likewiſe that there is no need of Tents for any other uſe or purpoſe, ſince that the Medicaments may be ſo melted, that they may very conveniently be inſtilled into the Wound.</p>
                     <p>The Second Reaſon is this, becauſe that they are injurious, and by their weight very troubleſom and grievous unto the Nature of the wounded part: whereupon it is likewiſe that Nature is alwaies laboring to expel them.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, becauſe that they diſtend the part, preſs it together, excite pain, and thereupon produce new fluxions.</p>

<pb n="2653" facs="tcp:49110:164"/> of the extreameſt pains and dangers; as a little above (in the 7. <hi>Chapter,</hi>) we gave you ſome inſtances and examples of this very thing, out of <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Anſwers unto the Reaſons of <hi>Magatus.</hi>
                        </note>Now as for what they Anſwer unto theſe Arguments, and what they likewiſe object, they are neither of them of any great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>For Firſt of all, whereas it is ſaid, that Tents are not neceſſary, that by them the Wound may he kept open, ſince that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is of it ſelf alwaies open, this we altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deny. For oftentimes Wounds (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the various Scituation of the Patient, that he then had when he was wounded) are oblique, and ful of turnings and windings; ſo that although the ſides and lips of the wound be not as yet cloſed up, they yet nevertheleſs ſo touch and lie one upon the other, yea and oftentimes ſo preſs one another that there is no open paſſage left for the <hi>Pus</hi> to flow forth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For this very cauſe, and when the Wounds are not ſtraight, the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot ſo eaſily penetrate unto the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom And albeit that the wound be not wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and oblique; yet notwithſtanding it wil not alwaies be Convenient to inſtil into the Wound Medicaments that are over fluid, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they may be eaſily waſhed away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the <hi>Sanies</hi> or thin Excrement: but there will be oftentimes occaſion to make uſe of the thicker and more viſcid ſort of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, which being conveyed into the Wound by the Tents will ſtick ſo much the longer and more firmly unto the wounded parts; and thereupon they will the more rightly put forth their Virtue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the ſuperior orifice of the Wound is never Conglutinated before ſuch time as the inferior Cavity is cloſed up (and that therefore the orifice of the Wound need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to be kept open with Tents) this is falſe; and experience very often teacheth us the Contrary: and <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> (in his 4. <hi>Cent. Obſervat</hi> 7.) reciteth two Examples of Wounds, whoſe orifices were very ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healed; and yet the Wound within all this while not cured; from whence it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there was abundance of <hi>Pus</hi> collected within; and from thence many grievous and dangerous Maladies excited. And wheras they ſay, that the continual efflux of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wil cauſe that the orifice of the wound ſhal not be cloſed up, herein they contradict their own former preſuppoſals, when as they aſſerted before, that there would be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very ſmal ſtore of <hi>Pus</hi> generated in the Wound.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Tents ought not neither to be over thick, that ſo they may not preſs the part, nor diſtend it, nor by any means whatſoever cauſe unto it any trouble, grief, or pain, and that they likewiſe ſhut not up the paſſage of the <hi>Pus</hi> or purulent mattier. And if now and then any ſuch thing ſhould happen, (ſuch as that that <hi>Ludovicus Septalius</hi> in his 8. <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Animadverſions, Num.</hi> 10. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth out of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Hiſtory of a certain perſon at <hi>Maſſilium</hi>) the Errors of the Artiſts are not to be imputed unto the Art it ſelf; when as haply they uncovered not the Wound ſo oft as was requiſite. And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs we are here to give you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that albeit we are to uſe our utmoſt endeavour, that Wounds may be Cured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all kind of trouble and pain; (or at leaſt that they may be healed with as little as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may be:) yet notwithſtanding it is not to be expected, that in the curing of Wounds there ſhould be at any time a total and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute freedom from all pain and trouble, no more then there is in the curing of other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. And indeed if al things were to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and for born that are any waies the Cauſe of any trouble whatſoever; then the ſewing of the Wound, as likewiſe the Swaths, and binding up of the Wound were all of them to be omitted. But the Rule is good in this caſe, that alwaies of two Evils the leſs is to be choſen.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Neither are Tents therefore to be omitted, becauſe that being defiled by the <hi>Pus</hi> they may hurt the wounded part. For as often as they ſhal be thus fouled and made naſty, they are to be drawn forth; and this very thing impugns the rare and ſeldom ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Wound.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, And laſt of all, although that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> where they treat of the Curing of Wounds, do not make expreſs mention of theſe Tents; ſo neither yet do they forbid the uſe of them: but rather out of the precepts of <hi>Galen</hi> as touching the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Wounds it may be proved, that the uſe of Tents is oftentimes by him allowed and approved of.</p>
                     <p>All the premiſes being therefore thus agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and diſcuſſed <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> the thing ſeems to come to this; and the whole ſum and ſubſtance of this Controverſie amounteth to thus much; that light and ſleight Wounds, and ſuch wherein there is not much <hi>Pus</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, may be committed unto Nature; and that it matters not much if ſuch Wounds as theſe be but ſeldom concovered. But yet I would not in the leaſt perſwade any Man, that in thoſe Wounds that are more grievous, and in which there is generated great ſtore of <hi>Pus</hi> and Excrements, he ſtand as an idle
<pb n="2654" facs="tcp:49110:165"/> Spectator and Triſler, doing little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing himſelf, but committing the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to Nature; in regard that from the neglect and omiſſion of the neceſſary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Wound, there may more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and damage ariſe in one day, then can afterwards be removed in a whole Month.</p>
                     <p>And ſo likewiſe for Tents: as on the one ſide where there is no need of them, I would not perſwade to the putting of any into the Wound, (much leſs that there ſhould be ſuch Tents made uſe of that may cauſe pain, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a fluxion, or hinder the flowing forth of the <hi>Pus;</hi>) ſo on the other hand, where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity urgeth, and the Cauſes before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned require the uſe of them, there I conceive they cannot poſſibly be omitted without da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and danger. But yet nevertheleſs in regard that experience perfecteth Art, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſhewing us the way;) I ſhall not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand or oppoſe any man in his making trial and experience even of this way likewiſe, ſo that it be (as I have ſaid before) without any danger unto the Patient; and as <hi>Magatus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf adviſeth, (in his 1 <hi>B.</hi> and 40. <hi>Ch. about the end thereof</hi>) beginning alwaies from thoſe more light and eaſie, and from theſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees proceeding unto thoſe that are more grievous and difficult.</p>

                  <p>THoſe things that have been (in the <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chapter</hi>) ſpoken touching the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talius,</hi> as concerning the curing of Wounds, put me now in minde of that Unguent they commonly cal the Weapon Salve. For as thoſe ſiple Wounds of the fleſh (as hath been ſaid in the <hi>foregoing Chapter</hi>) are Cured by the benefit of Nature alone, without any other great proviſion, without any frequent opening of the Wound, and without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of many Medicaments: So thoſe Wounds likewiſe that are ſaid to be cured by this Weapon-Salve, my Opinion is, that they are cured by the help and aſſiſtance of Nature alone. But in regard that there are many who have aſſerted the contrary; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we think it not amiſs in this place to make ſome enquiry into this Opinion of theirs; and to tel you what I conceive is to be thought as touching this Weapon-Salve.</p>
                  <p>Now we ſhall Firſt of all give you the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of this Unguent or Weapon-ſalve; and then we ſhall acquaint you with the uſe of it, and what Arguments are uſually brought for the defence therof. Now moſt are of Opinion, that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> was the firſt that found out this Weapon-Salve, and therefore the invention thereof is by very many aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto him; but whether he were the firſt that we find to have made mention hereof or not, of this there is no queſtion, but that he hath been very forward in the divulging of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paracelſus</hi> himſelf (in his 1. <hi>B. Archidox. Magicae</hi>) hath this deſcription of it.</p>

                  <p>Take <hi>the fat of a Bore Pig or Brawner, and Bears fat, of each four ounces; The older theſe Creatures are the better it their fat. Let both theſe fats firſt of all (for the ſpace of half
<pb n="2655" facs="tcp:49110:165"/> an hour boyl in red wine over a gentle fire. After this it is to be poured out upon cold water and the fat ſwimming a top is to be taken off with a ſpeon, and whatſoever ſinke to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom throw it away.</hi> Then afterwards,</p>
                  <p>Take, <hi>of Earth worms waſhed in Wine or Water, two ſextaries; let them be put for a while into the Bakers oven in an Earthen pot covered, where as they muſt be baked, ſo you muſt have a great care that they be not burnt; and after this, beat them into a pouder.</hi>
                  </p>

And all of them being bruiſed together, and well mingled with the fat, let there be an unguent made according to art; and then in a Glaſs veſſel ſtopt (or if you think good, in a Box) let it be carefully kept for uſe.</hi>

                     <hi>Now as touching the Efficacy and uſe of it, he thus writeth: This cure is performed by the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick attractive virtue of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, cauſed by the conſtellations, which thorow the medium of the Air is brought unto the wound, and Joyned therewith, that ſo the ſpiritual operation may be drawn forth into ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

                     <hi>There are therefore three things that by this unguent cauſe ſo admirable an Effect.</hi> 1. <hi>The Sympathy of Nature.</hi> 2. <hi>The influence of the heavenly Bodies, perfecting their operations by the Elements.</hi> 3. <hi>The Balſam, which being endued with a virtue of healing is naturally applyed unto any man, without any difference.

                        </gap>x he, (and yet ſo notwithſtanding that neither the Nerves, Arteries, nor yet any one of the three more principal members be hurt) ſo that the Weapon may but poſſibly be had, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the patient be many miles diſtant from us And in regard that it is of a Couglutinating, Suppurating, and renewing Nature, it doth not permit (if it be rightly applyed) any hurtful ſymptom to follow upon it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The manner of applying the Unguent, or Weapon ſalve.</note>Firſt, <hi>Let the Weapon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the man is Wounded be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynted every day once, if neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty require it, and the wound be great: but otherwiſe it will be ſufficient, if the Weapon be anoynted every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or third day; and then let it be kept in a Clean Linen Cloth, and in a place a little warm but not over hot, leſt that any damage ſhould thereby be brought upon the Patient: We muſt likewiſe be very careful that the Weapon fall not down from on high, neither that the wind blow upon it in a cold place; for if this ſhould happen the Patient wil run mad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Before you anoynt the Weapon, Conſider, whether the Wound were made with the point, by pricking: and if it were, let the Weapon be firſt anoynted upwards, (and not below) and ſo deſcending toward the point thereof; for otherwiſe much hurt may be brought upon the Patient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>But if thou canſt not certainly know how deep, or in what manner the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon entered into the fleſh, thou mayſt then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynt it all over; but otherwiſe it will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to anoynt that part of the Weapon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with any one is hurt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>There is no Neceſſity of ſewing the wound together after the manner of Barber Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons; but every day only to bind it up with a clean linen Cloth, firſt wet in the Patients <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>That day that any one anoynts the Weapon, let him abſtain from Venery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Before the anoynting of the Weapon, let the Wounded perſons blood be with al ſpeed ſtanched.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>In fractures, and ruptures of bones, you may add unto the unguent ſome of the powder of the greater comfry, or the roots of black, Hellebor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Having the weapon wherewith the Patient was hurt, if thou be deſirous to know whether the Patient be likely to live, or to die of his Wound; thou art to make the trial in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Take the weapon and make it hot over the coals, ſo hot that thou can hardly endure thy hand upon it; and then ſprinkle upon it ſome powder of Red Sanders, and the blood ſtone; and if the Weapon then ſweat drops of blood, the patient will die; but if not, he wil eſcape it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if we would know whether the Patient order himſelf aright in his drink and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites: this may thus be known, if there be in the weapon ſpots of blood, he is diſordered; but if no ſuch ſpots, then the Patient ordereth himſelf aright.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We are moreover to take notice; firſt, that if we have not the Weapon, (or inſtrument, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it were) yet nevertheleſs that any violent
<pb n="2656" facs="tcp:49110:166"/> opening of the Skin, and hurting of the fleſh, by which any Blood goeth forth, may be Cured with this unguent, ſo that a little piece of Sallow Wood be moyſtened in the bloody opening; and after that the Blood ſticking thereto be dryed (not by the heat of the Sun, or the fire, but of it ſelf, and own accord) it be then put into the above mentioned <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent, kept cloſe covered in the Box, and there left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, If the Wound ſhould be great and deep, it may then be cleanſed every morning, and bound up with a new Linen Cloth, without any other uſe of Extraneous Oyls, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguents, and the like; and then this wound (how ever it were inflicted) will heal of it ſelf; and it ſufficeth that the little piece of Wood once only moyſtened in the opening of the Bloody wound, be then put into the Box of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent (as aforeſaid) and there left to remain, until the Wound be perfectly Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, But yet notwithſtanding, as oft as any new Wound is to be healed, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies required a new piece of Wood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, But if it be ſo that the Wound wil not bleed, it is then with the Wood ſo long to be ſcarified, until the blood flow forth: and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the curing of the Tooth-ach; the pained Tooth is ſo long to be ſcraped with a Pen-knife, until it bleed; and then the Pen-knife after the blood is dryed up, it to be anoynted with this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent; and ſo the pain is preſently aſſwaged. If a Horſe be prickt with a Nail in his Foot, let the Nail be firſt of all drawn forth, and anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ugment, and the Horſes Foot ſhall immediately be cured, without any ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſo in this ſame manner all living Creatures having fleſh and Bones may be Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>

Neither doth he add the Mummy, or the fat, or the Blood. And this others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do. And I my ſelf knew one, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking ſuch a Cure, Compounded (as oft as he pleaſed) this Unguent only of the <hi>fat of a Porker,</hi> and a few other things, without any of the ſaid <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſnea,</hi> or any thing elſe taken from the Body of Man.</p>
                  <p>That Polypragmatick <hi>Johannes Colerus</hi> (in the 18. <hi>B.</hi> of his <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Colerus</hi> his Deſcription.</note> and 154. <hi>Chap.</hi>) gives us this Deſcription.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>the fat of a Brawn, and of a Bear, of each half a pound; Moſs of a Mans Skul, one pugil; Earth-worms, one quart; Blood-ſtone, two ounces; Red Saunders, and Root of the greater Conſound, of each three ounces; mingle them, and with Wine make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither do they all agree as touching the time wherein they would have this Unguent to be made. <hi>Crollius</hi> requireth the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it, the Sun being in the Sign <hi>Libra.</hi> Others do include this time within narrower bounds yet; and they will have it to be only the tenth and eleventh day of <hi>September.</hi> But others there are that allow us any time for the providing of it.</p>
                  <p>But now as for the manner of uſing this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament; it having been ſo fully and largly deſcribed and ſet down before out of <hi>Crol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> I hold it needleſs here to repeat it. The Sum is this in a word;<note place="margin">The manner of uſing it.</note> the wound it ſelf is not to be anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this Unguent, but the weapon; or the inſtrument what ever it be wherewith the wound is inflicted: or if this cannot be had, then any other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, or wood, (but more eſpecially that of the Sallow Tree) or any thing elſe put into the Wound, and there died and ſtained with the blood of the wounded perſon. And they likewiſe conceive that it matters but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, (or not at all) whether the wounded party be preſent, or many miles diſtant; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they any regard at all unto the wounded perſon, but only unto the weapon, that this be anoynted. But yet nevertheleſs, ſome there are who give in charge likewiſe, that the Wound be every day waſhed and made clean with Urine or Wine.</p>
                  <p>But now leſt any one ſhould doubt of the effect of this Medicament; they firſt of all appeal unto Experience: and <hi>Rudolphus Goclenius</hi> the younger writeth that he is able to nominate Emperours, Kings, Princes, Earls, and Lords, (whoſe Authority and Credit was no way to be called in queſtion)
<pb n="2657" facs="tcp:49110:166"/> that were ready to give their teſtimonials touching the efficacy of this Unguent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged for the Weapon-ſalve:</note>Moreover the Patrons of this Unguent think (as they tel us) that there may be natural cauſes rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this Action. And <hi>Crollius</hi> term al ignorant and ſimple that doubt of the efficacy of this Medicament, or that refer this Cure unto Sorcery. But now that they may prove that this Cure may be performed in a Natural way, they firſt of al take a great deal of pains to prove, that there are ſome actions to be inſtanced in, that are not wrought by the intervening of any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal contact, but by an occult Sympathy, and <hi>Magnetiſm</hi> (as they call it.) And ſo the Load-ſtone draweth Iron, albeit that it touch it not corporeally; and it is moved toward the Pole. The Stars do alſo Act upon theſe inferior Bodies, without any the aforeſaid Contact. The <hi>Torpedo</hi> or Cramp-Fiſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth the hand of him that holdeth the Spear. There are ſome likewiſe that can by no means endure to be in the Room with a Cat ſhut up in a Basket; and although they ſee her not, yet they can by no means brook her preſence; ſo that, unleſs either the Cat be carryed forth, or themſelves remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into ſome other Room, they preſently fal into ſwounding ſits. Dogs likewiſe know their Maſters foot-ſteps, as alſo the treadings and traces of wild beaſts, by which they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and purſue them. The ſhade of the Yew-Tree is very hurtful unto mankind. And very many more of ſuch like inſtances and examples that may be obſerved in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they heap up, to prove that there may be Natural occult Actions without any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Contact: which (becauſe that they are moſt manifeſt in the Load-ſtone) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from it they cal them all in general Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick: Actions.</p>
                  <p>Another thing that they preſuppoſe and take for granted, is this, that there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpirit of the world, diffuſed al the world over; which ſpirit (ſay they) is the Director and Vehicle of al occult powers and Actions; and which conjoyneth and keeps together all the parts of the world; and cauſeth a ſweet and admirable agreement and harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
                  <p>But Thirdly, As for what concerns the virtues of the Weapon-ſalve, they tel us that there is in it a two-fold virtue, one in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent it ſelf, to wit, of Conſolidating and agglutinating of the Wound; and the other that that is in the Weapon anoynted, &amp; which carrieth that power unto the wound. They derive this former virtue from many things of which this Medicament is compounded, and from the influence of the Conſtellations, as alſo the Aſtral and Elemental Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore (as we told you before) ſome there are that never make this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent but at ſuch a certain time of the yeer, and poſition of the Stars. But the other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue they derive from the Natural Balſam, which together with the Blood ſticketh upon the Weapon or inſtrument preſſed upon the Wound, but firſt beſmeared with the Blood of the wounded perſon. For this Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam (ſay they) by reaſon of that Sympathy it hath with the Wounded part communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth unto the Wound the ſaid virtue of the Medicament, by the Mediation of the ſpirit of the World. And for the confirming of this they produce likewiſe other examples. The <hi>Zenith</hi> (as they term it) of young Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens being caſt into the fire (they ſay) very grievouſly hurteth the virgin from whom it came; and that the <hi>Secundines</hi> (or after births) if they be ill handled wil cauſe great damage and danger unto that Woman out of whom they flowed. Although they do not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe here ſufficiently and cleerly explain themſelves. For <hi>Crollius</hi> writeth, that this Cure is performed by the Magnetick attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive virtue of the ſaid Medicament cauſed by the Conſtellations; which virtue (ſay they) by the <hi>Medium</hi> of the Air may be brought unto the Wound, and conjoyned therewith: and then immediatly he addeth that there are three things that by this Medicament Cauſe ſo admirable an effect. 1. The Sympathy of Nature. 2. The influence of the Celeſtial Bodies, performing its operations by the Elements. 3. The Balſam, that being endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a healing virtue is Naturally put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any one whatſoever, without any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of either Perſon or Sex.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Reaſons againſt the defenders of the Weapon-ſalve:</note> But in very truth (that we may briefly open unto you, and ſhew you our Opinion touching this Unguent) that which in the firſt place rendereth it very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious, is this, that they give us not one only way for the compoſition of this Unguent but very many; and in ſome of them thoſe things are omitted and wholly left out, from which others derive al the virture of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament; as is apparent from the many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions above mentioned.

                  <p>As touching the effect of this Medicament; that it doth not evermore anſwer the deſire and expectation, we are ſhewn by <hi>Guilbel. Gabricius,</hi> in his <hi>third Cent.</hi> and 25. <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> And be it ſo, that (as many great and eminent perſons have teſtified) divers who have made uſe hereof have recovered: yet nevertheleſs theſe can atteſt no more but this, that the perſon was wounded, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him there was adminiſtred this kind of Cure by the Weapon-Salve, and that this perſon recovered: but that he recovered by the virtue of this Medicament, this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not teſtifie. For there may be oftentimes many things conjoyned with ſome effect, that are not the Cauſe thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as it doth not follow, that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon walking it Lightened, therefore his wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king was the cauſe of the Lightening; ſo no more will it follow, this wounded perſon was healed, and he applied the Weapon-Salve, therefore the Weapon-Salve was the cauſe of the cure; unleſs it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that from the ſaid Unguent this effect neceſſarily followed. And in nothing indeed is the fallacy of the cauſe more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent then in Phyſick; where oftentimes the healing of ſome Diſeaſe is attributed unto this or that Medicament; whereas the truth is, it proceeded not from the ſaid Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but either from Nature her ſelf, or elſe from ſuch other Medicaments as were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred before, together with, or after the ſaid Medicament whereunto the Cure is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. And a very great difference there is between Phyſick and other Arts. For in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arts the effect being upon ſomthing that is ſolid dependeth wholly upon the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer: and if there be any thing well or ill done by him, all this is to be imputed and aſcribed unto the Artiſt, unleſs it ſo fal out, as happily it may, and often doth, that by reaſon of the unfitneſs of the ſubject matter, (for as we uſe to ſay, a Mercury or Statue is not made of every piece of Wood) or elſe by reaſon of ſome fault in the Inſtrument, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what may happen to be done amiſs; ſince that, as we told you before (in the <hi>firſt B. of our Inſtitutions,</hi> and 1. <hi>Chap.</hi>) the ſubjects of other Arts do nothing at all, but only obey the will of the workman: whereas in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, the ſubject matter thereof hath a certain innate power; by which (being aſſiſted by the Phyſitian) for the moſt part of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it tendeth unto health: from whence it is that by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (6. <hi>Epid. Comm.</hi> 5. <hi>Text</hi> 1.) they are ſaid to be the <hi>Curers of the Diſeaſes of Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the whol buſineſs in ſhort comes to this, that the State of the Controverſie here is not, whether in a perſon wounded, and recovered again, the Cure were done by the Weapon-Salve; but this, whether or no the Weapon-Salve were the Cauſe of the healing of the Wound; touching which we are now to make a little further enquiry.</p>
                  <p>Now it being ſo that Nature (as we ſhewed you above) is the Cauſe of the Wounds Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination, but without the virtue of any Medicament, (under what Notion or Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſoever,) and that oftentimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe even by Lard (or ſome other thing of no great moment) laid on, many Wounds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of any other Medicaments, or any aſſiſtance from the Phyſitian, have been Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; therefore, in the Cure likewiſe that is by ſome thought to be done by this Weapon-Salve,
<pb n="2659" facs="tcp:49110:167"/> the Conglutination of the Wound is to be aſcribed unto Nature alone, as the next and principal cauſe. Which being ſo, and the truth thereof being ſuch that it cannot be denied, now in the next place we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether in the ſaid Cure the healing of the Wound be to be aſcribed unto Nature alone; or elſe indeed whether or no there be not likewiſe ſome Concurrent efficacy of the Weapon-Salve. Unto me the former ſeemeth the more probable, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it is a truth moſt certain (as but now we told you) that Wounds are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Cured by Nature alone without the Concurrence of any Medicament; the truth whereof is ſufficiently atteſted likewiſe by internal Wounds, unto which there cannot poſſibly be any Medicaments adminiſtred. And hitherto tendeth the whole buſineſs in the curing of Wounds (according to <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> his way, touching which we have ſpoken in the foregoing Chapter) to wit, that the whole work be committed to Nature, that the heat and temper of the part (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſtrument) be kept entire, and that without urgent neceſſity it be not moleſted and diſquieted by Medicaments. And ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we ſee that ſuch dangerous Wounds chiefly and eſpecially by the benefit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without the application of any Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (or ſuch as is of no great moment) are cured; ſo that it ſeems to be aſcribed rather unto a Miracle, then the Medicaments. Of which very thing the Obſervations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are every where ſufficiently known. Neither yet notwithſtanding are the Patrons of this Unguent ſo bold as to extend the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof unto al Wounds; for (as a little before we told you) <hi>Crollius</hi> and <hi>Goclenius</hi> do except the Wounds of the more principal Members, as alſo of the Nerves and Arteries: and there was never yet found any that durſt make uſe of this Unguent in Wounds cauſed by Gun ſhot. And who is there that dares de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that other lighter and ſleighter Wounds may be cured by Nature alone? And if any thing extraordinary, and that which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to exceed the power of Nature, happen at any time in the ſaid Cure by the Weapon-Salve, we ought well to conſider, and look unto it, whether it be not wrought by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Devil, thereunto engaged by a Compact and agreement, either explicite, or implicite.</p>
                  <p>And now therefore it being a known truth, that Nature alone (and as the next Cauſe) may agglutinate Wounds, and that Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as above we ſhewed you) do perform nothing elſe then the preſervation of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat, and the Natural Temperament of the part, or the removal of thoſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that hinder Nature in her work; we are now in the next place to ſee, whether the Weapon-Salve can perform thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>Where we inſtantly meet with this firſt difficulty, to wit,<note place="margin">Whether the Weapon Salve can Act at a diſtance?</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſibly the Medicament that is not anoynted upon the Wound it ſelf, but upon the Weapon, or any thing elſe that is beſmeared with Blood from the Wound, can yield any benefit, eſpecially if the wounded perſon be abſent, and many miles diſtant from the anoynted Weapon. And indeed to prove this, they uſe two Reaſons, as we alſo told you formerly: the firſt is this, that there may be actions from occult and hidden qualities, and at a diſtance, (which they cal Magnetick actions) becauſe that by the ſpirit of the world the virtue of the Unguent may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto the Wound, as we ſee it to be done by the Sympathy and Antipathy of many things.</p>
                  <p>But neither proveth the thing that it ought to prove. For firſt of all, albeit we grant that ſuch Actions there are, and that thoſe things that mutually Act, and are paſſive, do not alwaies corporeally touch one the other; yet nevertheleſs, that this is ſo in the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-Salve, and whether or no any virtue can be derived from the Weapon anoynted unto the Wound at ſo great a diſtance and interval of places, this is yet to be proved. For it doth not follow, there are ſuch admirable actions of other things, and therefore alſo the Weapon-Salve hath ſuch a vertue. And that this is not done, he ſhal eaſily perceive that will but conſider thoſe other Actions of this Nature, that are performed at a diſtance. Since that the operation followeth the being of a thing, it is therefore neceſſary that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Agent and the Patient there ſhould be a certain conjunction, and mutual Contact. But now, in regard that the things between which the Action is do not all of them touch one the other with their Bodies, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that they ſhould touch in ſome other manner. And this is twofold:<note place="margin">Action at a diſtance two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:</note> for either the thing that is ſaid to act at a diſtance, ſendeth forth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from its own Body and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, (which the Ancients called <hi>Effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> or Aporrhoia, and Phyſitians where they treat of Contagion, cal it <hi>Miaſmos;</hi> touching which ſee further in the <hi>fourth B. of Feavers, Chap.</hi> 4. and the 2. <hi>B. of our Inſtitutions, Part</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.) to wit, when there flow forth of the Body the ſmalleſt imaginable parts, and Atomes, and by the <hi>Medium</hi> of
<pb n="2660" facs="tcp:49110:168"/> the Air (or ſome other body,) are tranſfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto another body, and affect it with that virtue which it hath in common with the whol entire body. But now as for ſuch ſmall bodies as theſe, they have no Regular motion at al, but according to the motion of the Air they move inordinatly this way and that way, and by every blaſt they are variouſly diſperſed; like as we may ſee in the ſmoak of Candles when they are extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and of other things when they are firſt lighted and kindled. But other bodies there are that Acting at a diſtance do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſend forth from their own body any thing that may be transferred unto another body, but only they ſend forth a <hi>ſpecies</hi> as we may call it; and in this manner, by means of theſe ſenſible <hi>ſpecies,</hi> as light, ſound, ſmel, and the like, even the diſtant bodies are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. And very probable it is, that there are more of theſe like ſenſible ſpecies then what are perceived by our ſenſes. And this is commonly ſayd ſo be done by a virtue, or virtual contact. And yet nevertheleſs vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue doth always preſuppoſe a ſubſtance from which the ſaid virtue floweth. So the flame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extinguiſhed, the illumination or light that comes from it that alſo ceaſeth. And moreover ſecondly there is likewiſe a fit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject required, thorow which it may be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated; which if there be not, the Action ceaſeth. And ſo an opacous and thick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being interpoſed betwixt the light body and our ſight, the Illumination ceaſeth. Thirdly, this virtue is likewiſe diffuſed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicularly, and at a certain diſtance; Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts term it the ſphere of Activity; which in ſome things is greater, and in others leſs. The greateſt of all is in light or lucid bodies, but a leſs in thoſe bodies that yield a ſound. But yet the greater the lucid and lightſom body is the greater alſo is its ſphere of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: and hereupon it is, that the ſtarrs of all other bodies do ſcatter and diſperſe their light from them furtheſt in diſtance and wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in breadth.</p>
                  <p>We are now therefore to make enquiry (in regard that it is of a certainty that the Weapon ſalve with which the Weapon is anoynted, is in body abſent and diſtant from the wounded party) whether the weapon-ſalve touch the Wounded body either of theſe two waies; for a third way there is none. Neither can this be done by Accident &amp; ſome quality; ſince that an Accident doth not paſs from one ſubject to another, neither dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it ſelf at a diſtance, and unto any other body. Now I ſay that this is not done, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed can be, either of theſe wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Weapon-ſalve doth not Act by ſending forth any ſmall bodies.</note>For firſt of all, thoſe Atomes or Effluvious bodies that flow forth, having no certain moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own, but moving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately hither and thither, this way and that way, how can theſe poſſibly directly and in a ſtraight line tend unto the wounded perſon? Neither is there any Cauſe, that we ſhould here fly unto and plead the likeneſs of Subſtance. For although that thoſe ſmalleſt bodies do at the length apply themſelves unto others of their own kinds, (as we may plainly ſee in thunder and lightning) yet notwithſtanding when they at firſt exhale out of the body they wander up and down inordinately, this way and that way. And much leſs may we have recourſe unto the ſpirit of the World, by whoſe carrying and conveying whereof theſe ſmalleſt bodies may from the weapon anointed at length come unto the wounded perſon, and the wound it ſelf. For thoſe things are indeed ſpoken of the ſpirit of the world, but they are not proved; yea but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are oppoſed by reaſons ſtrong and weighty. And furthermore, ſince that this cure extends it ſelf very far in length, and (as they wil have us beleeve) at the diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome miles; if this were done by the effuſion of thoſe ſmall bodies, ſeeing there is ſo very little of the Unguent, and yet much leſs of that natural Balſam that ſticketh unto the Weapon, that Unguent with the Balſam would eaſily fly abroad into the Air, and there vaniſh; and ſo the very foundation of the cure being taken away and gone, the cure it ſelf muſt needs ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Weapon ſalve doth not Act by any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</note>But if they wil ſay, that his Action is performed by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or Magnetick action, they ought firſt of all to prove that there are ſuch ſpecies in this Unguent; (for indeed Nature hath given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome ſimples and things natural, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by art, a virtue of ſending forth ſuch like ſpecies as theſe we ſpeak of) and then they muſt ſhew us what the nature of them is, and what their ſphere of Activity. For it is no way credible, that the virtue of this Unguent ſhould extend it ſelf for twelve miles round about, and ſo orbicularly. As for what concerns the Loadſtone, (from which they are wont to term theſe magnetick actions) the Load-ſtone doth indeed attract the Iron although it be at ſome diſtance from it; but if very far removed, and beyond the ſphere of its Activity, it doth not attract: and the very ſame is likewiſe well known to be done in other ſuch like occult and magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Actions. For the Loadſtone, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like bodies, do put forth their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="2661" facs="tcp:49110:168"/> in a ſtraight and direct line, which yet nevertheleſs are not extended <hi>in infinitum</hi> (as we ſay) and they are oftentimes likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted by the interpoſing of other things. So the Sun-beams by the coming between of an opacous body are excluded. Who then can believe, that from ſo ſmal a pittance of the Unguent, and ſo little of the blood, there ſhould break forth ſo many of theſe ſmall bodies or ſpecies, thorow the cheſt in which the anoynted weapon is ſhut up, and that they ſhould thence be carried ſo great a diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, (even twelve miles) that they ſhould penetrate thorow Mountains and Walls, and tend directly unto the wounded perſon cloſe ſhut up within his Chamber, or in bed, and that there they ſhould paſs throw thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny double ſwathes wherein the wound is wrapped, and ſo inſinuate themſelves at length into the wound it ſelf? The Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is moved unto the Iron; but this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent is not anoynted upon the Wound, but upon the Weapon. And the Loadſtone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being but only moved toward the Iron, draweth it; but now in the right uſing of this unguent, what a company of Ceremonies and ſuperſtitious practiſes there are uſed we have ſhewn you before. And in other reſpects alſo there appeareth a very vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Loadſtone and this Weapon ſalve. The Loadſtone is a natural body and ſo hath its Natural Effect, wh ch it evermore worketh in one and the ſame manner. The Weapon ſalve is a Compoſition out of many things; and by ſome it is made one way, and by others after a different manner, and of other things, as before we have ſhewn you. And the Unguent ought alſo to effect many things, to wit, perform all thoſe things that are Neceſſary for the curing of the wound, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Wound free from pain, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bring pain upon it if it be not rightly preſerved, or if it chance to be defiled. For if it ought to perform all that that is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the work of Nature in the curing of Wounds; there will be then altogether a neceſſity that it perform many things; to wit, that it concoct whatſoever is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted that it expel the <hi>Pus</hi> and excrements, and that it generate fleſh. Yea moreover it ought to perform the office both of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, and alſo of the Medicaments, which is indeed very various. For neither are all thoſe bodies that are Wounded a like diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſome of them being ſound bodies, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Plethorick, and a third ſort Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical; the parts likewiſe are various, as fleſh, Nerves, Membranes; which require Medicaments of a different kind; the virtues of all which this unguent ought to ſuſtain. And if a man ſhall at one and the ſame time (as it very often happeneth) receive dvers wounds in different parts of his body, and from different weapons; the queſtion then wil be, whether it be ſufficient to anoynt one of the Weapons only, and whether or no the virtue thereof wil be conveyed unto al theſe ſeveral wounds; or whether or no all the weapons are to be anoynted; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther each particular unguent wil do its own office, and this tend ſtraight and directly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that wound that was inflicted by this wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; and that unguent likewiſe unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wound made by that other weapon?</p>
                  <p>A reaſon ſhould likewiſe be rendered why the unguent ſhould not perform the ſame while it is in the box, which they ſay it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms when it is anoynted upon the weapon. For they have no ground to ſay that by the benefit of that balſam that is in the blood the virtue of the Medicament is carried and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto the wound. For if all that whol blood were reſolved into Atomes, it would not be ſufficient to fil up all that ſo great a ſpace. Neither have they as yet proved, that the blood can ſend forth out of it ſelf any ſuch ſpecies. And if by the benefit of the blood the virtue of the Medicament may be carried unto the wound, why ſhould it not then likewiſe carry to the wound the virtues of other things, into the which out of woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſons the blood is oftentimes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly poured out, which yet we ſee that it doth not.</p>
                  <p>But now as for thoſe things that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg in ſpecial touching the Secundines, and the firſt menſtruous blood of Virgins, and as for their aſſerting that if this blood be not rightly handled, there is much hurt and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age brought unto thoſe maydens, theſe things are to be imputed unto the ſuperſtition of theſe young Women. And if in woman kind the Secundines being caſt forth into ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean places bring damage unto theſe women from whom they came, why is not the like done in bruit Creatures, whoſe Secundines or after births being caſt forth and buried in dung do oftentimes putrefy? And in what place ſoever you dig and bury theſe ſecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, they yet notwithſtanding rot and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy. And why alſo do not the <hi>Molae</hi> (or falſe conceptions) which women uſe to burn, bring any hurt and damage unto the Woman from whom it proceeded? And why ſhould the firſt menſtruous blood if it be burnt bring damage unto the virgin, and none of the reſt?</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being as we have ſaid, and the caſe thus ſtanding, there is no need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further tedious diſpute touching thoſe virtues that this unguent is ſaid to have in curing the Wound, ſeeing that it is hitherto
<pb n="2662" facs="tcp:49110:169"/> ſufficiently proved, that there cometh no virtue at all from this Unguent unto the Wound. And if this Unguent had indeed any virtue at all in it either of preſerving and cheriſhing the temperament or the innate heat of the part (they commonly cal it the Balſam) or of drying up the Excrements, it would better and more commodiouſly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and put forth this virtue, being anoynted upon the wounded part it ſelf, then upon the Weapon. And beſides all this, if (as ſome will have it) the virtue and ſtrength of this Medicament conſiſt in the Blood and fat of Man, why then do ſome of them likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it unto the Wounds of other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to wit, of Horſes, &amp;c.? For how great is the Difference between a Man and a Horſe?</p>
                  <p>But that <hi>Crollius</hi> and ſome others (that I may not here altogether omit the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this alſo) derive the vertue of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament from the Heaven, and therefore command the preparing of it in ſuch a certain poſition of the Heavens: Neither will that at al patronize this Cauſe. For they have not as yet proved, that there is in the Heavens or any of the Stars any virtue at all to heal Wounds; or that if there were any ſuch vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in theſe, that it doth ſo mingle it ſelf with this Unguent, that as if it were in a manner bound and ſhut up, it may be carried up and down about with us, and drawn forth into uſe and Act when we pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>And ſo likewiſe as touching the manner of uſing this Medicament, this alſo hath no Foundation to uphold it, neither doth it want for ſuperſtition. For firſt of al, ſeeing that they place the whole Cauſe of the Cure in this, that the virtue of the Medicament is derived unto the Wound by the benefit of the natural Balſam that is in the Blood; why then do they anoynt only the Weapon with the which the man was wounded, or ſome other Weapon, or a piece of Wood bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died with the Blood of the Wound; and why do they not as well anoynt his ſhirt, or the other Garments of the wounded party, or a Stone, or any thing elſe what ever it be upon which the Blood hath been ſpilt or poured out: and if not, there is then ſome implicite underhand compact with the Devil to be ſuſpected. And moreover, why if the wound be made with the pricking of a Sword do they anoynt the Sword in the point therof towards the hilt; but if the wound be made by the Cut of a Sword, then they anoynt it from the edge towards the back: and if it appear how far and deep the Sword penetrated into the wound, ſo far they anoynt it, and no farther; but if it doth not appear how far it pierced, they then anoynt the Sword all over: all which are no better then Superſtitious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and of which no Reaſon can be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. For if the power and faculty of the Medicament be Natural, what doth this or that manner of uſing it in the anoynting make to the thing it ſelf, and whether or no doth it add any new virtue and quality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? If the vertues be Natural, there is no need of any ſuch Ceremonies; as it plainly appeareth in all Natural things whatſoever. The Load-ſtone draweth the Iron; and the Iron being touched with the Load-ſtone is moved unto the North-pole, without any of the aforeſaid Ceremonies. And furthermore, ſome there are that anoynt the Weapon once every day, others every Second, or Third day; and ſome content themſelves with once only anoynting. And ſome there are, who (that ſo they may not Erre in the anoynting) wholly dip and plunge the Weapon (or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Wood, that now and then ſerves in ſtead thereof) into the Unguent kept in along Box, or little Cheſt, until the Wound be perfectly healed; but they altogether neglect the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it ſelf, that dip the Arms (or that they make uſe of in their ſtead) all over in the Unguent. But others there are that keep the anoynted Weapon in any temperate place what ever it be; and others likewiſe ſhut it up in a little Cheſt. But al of them general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are exceeding Cautious in this, that the Weapon be never kept in any place that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hot, or over cold, and that it be not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with filth and impurities: for if this ſhould happen, the Cure will by this means be hindered, and a moſt grievous pain in the Wound procured unto the ſick perſon: All which are meerly frivolous and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. For ſeeing that (as it is before ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved) there cannot poſſibly be any action of the Weapon-Salve upon the wound at a far diſtance, and interval of place from the Wound; ſo likewiſe we ſay, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly excite any pain. And therefore we conclude, that if this at any time happen, it is then cauſed and procured by the help and aſſiſtance of ſome evil ſpirit. And moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that the Blood of wounded perſons is not alwaies poured forth into clean places, but oftentimes into places very noyſom and unclean; and that in the Winter time it is frozen; and that the Bloody Linen Clothes are waſhed with warm Water, and the wood be ſprinkled with the Blood oftentimes burnt, and yet nevertheleſs the ſick perſon doth not hereupon feel any pain, or ſuffer any damage whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And furthermore we ſay, that they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto this Unguent things altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
<pb n="2663" facs="tcp:49110:169"/> and thoſe virtues all which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be found in any one Natural Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For they affirm that by this Unguent may be Cured all wounds whatever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inflicted by downright cutting, or pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, by a fal, or any thing caſt at the party. But great is the diverſity of Wounds accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the various Circumſtances that attend them; and therefore there is not required one only Medicament, but divers Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are required unto the Curing of them. A Wound inflicted by a ſharp and keen Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon is Cured without the generating of much <hi>Pus:</hi> but in that which is from a blunt Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, whatſoever is bruiſed muſt of neceſſity al of it convert into <hi>Pus.</hi> And there is alſo an exceeding great difference of the parts. In a fleſhy part (eſpecially, when the man is of a ſound and healthy Conſtitution) the Wound is eaſily Cured; but much harder is that Wound to be cured that is inflicted upon the Brain, Nerves, Tendons, and Ligaments, (eſpecially the greater ones) ſuch as are thoſe in the Hams. They promiſe the Patient likewiſe that the Cure of the Wound ſhal be altogether without pain: which in all parts to perform is a thing altogether impoſſible. For certainly if a Nerve be prickt, there is no man that can make good his promiſe, that here in this no pain ſhall afflict the Party.</p>
                  <p>And that we may now conclude whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be further ſaid in this Controverſie; the Curing of the Wound that is aſcribed unto this Weapon-Salve, (as hath been ſaid) is for the moſt part to be a attributed unto Nature, whoſe work alone it is to Cure not only light and trivial Wounds, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo Wounds moſt grievous and ful of danger. Which appeareth even from this, that there are ſo many ſeveral deſciptions given us of this Unguent; and that there have been ſome, who inſtead of this compound Weapon-Salve have made uſe of Lard only, or Hogs fat, and yet notwithſtanding the Wound, have been Cured; which <hi>Johannes Colerius</hi> teſtifieth (as before we alleadged him) that he himſelf had ſeen; as we may find it in the before cited place of his <hi>Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks.</hi> But now, if upon the adminiſtring of this Medicament ſome moſt grievous Wound ſhal be healed, which may ſeem altogether to tranſcend the power of Nature, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſs by the power of the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, drawn thereunto by ſome compact ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explicite or implicite. Neither is the ſuſpition hereof any waies to be leſſened, or removed, by what is ſaid by ſome, to wit, that all the ſimples that make up the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this Medicament, Unguent, or (as it is commonly called,) Weapon-Salve, are all of them altogether Natural; and that in the Compoſition hereof, or the anoynting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with there are neither Characters, nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations, nor Charms and Inchantments made uſe of. For the Devil doth oftentimes hide and conceal the Compact that he makes not only under Characters and Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or a certain form of words, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe even under things Natural, if at his command (which is done indeed in the firſt and explicite Compact, wherein others that adminiſter and apply the ſame things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely and inconſiderately may likewiſe involve themſelves) things that are Natural be made uſe of for other purpoſes then what they were Created for by God; and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Diabolical and Magical Actions are concealed and obtruded under the veil of Magnetick Actions. And therefore, although it be granted, that by this Unguent the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſon is healed (which yet nevertheleſs is, as we have ſaid, wrought by the benefit of Nature) yet it is not impoſſible, but that the Devil, that he may deſtroy the Soul, by Gods permiſſion in many things may help the Body after a certain manner: yet it is very Credible, in regard that he is the implacable enemy of Mankinde, and evermore ready and provided to do them all manner of hurt and miſchief, that he may ſeduce and draw men (as far as lieth in his power) from God the Creator, and Author of all good; and from the Means by him ordained, unto things ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and unwarrantable practiſes.</p>

                     <hi>Chap. 11.</hi> Of Altering Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Vulnerary Potions.</head>
                  <p>VVE told you before, that there are two ſorts of Medicaments that are made uſe of in the Curing of Wounds, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and internal. Touching the external we have hitherto ſpoken; we will therefore now in this Chapter handle the internal. Now thoſe are of two Sorts; ſome only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and ſome in ſpecial called vulnerary. Altering Medicaments, are Coolers, Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and ſuch as are but lightly (leſt they might otherwiſe breed obſtructions) Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: which are to this end adminiſtred, that they may hinder the Humors that they eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wax not hot, become fluxile, and receive a putridneſs. And ſuch are made of <hi>Succory, Endive, Sorrel, Plantane, Tormentil, Roſes, Purſlane, Water Lilly, Borrage, Saunders, Juyce of Citron, Juyce of Pome-Granates, Harts-Horn, Margarites, and Coralls:</hi> out of which there are made Decoctions, diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Waters, Syrups, Electuaries, and Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <pb n="2664" facs="tcp:49110:170"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Whether Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary potions are to be made uſe of.</note>And moreover there are made uſe of certain Medicaments, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more eſpcially, that are termed vulnerary. Touching which notwithſtanding Authors differ amongſt themſelves. For ſome of them (among whom is <hi>Balduinus Rouſſaeus,</hi> in his <hi>Medicinal Epiſtles, Epiſt.</hi> 66.) do indeed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of them in thoſe wounded parts unto which theſe kinde of Potions do reach, as the Gullet, Stomack, and Inteſtines, and then they have in a manner the place of Topick Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but in the external parts they reject them,<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</note> for theſe Cauſes. Firſt, Becauſe that in the writings of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and the Ancient Phyſitians they finde no mention made of theſe vulnerary potions. Secondly, becauſe that by Reaſon of the diſtance of the Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will not beleeve, that theſe poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can poſſibly penetrate unto the extream Limbs, or the Head; nor yet unto the greater and thicker Guts, unto which therefore when they are wounded Medicaments may more commodiouſly be injected by Clyſters, then given to drink; yea they conceive that thoſe Aſtringents that for the moſt part are ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therewith may hinder that thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments may not penetrate unto the more deep and inward parts. Thirdly, Becauſe thac there is a great difference between the Medicaments out of which theſe potions are prepared; ſince that ſome of them are hot and opening, as <hi>Betony, Speed-well, Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Avens, Carduus Benedictus,</hi> &amp;c. as alſo Cold, and Aſtringent, as <hi>great Comfrey, Winter green, Horſ-Tail, Burnet, Tormentil,</hi> &amp;c. So that it doth not ſufficiently appear of what faculty the Medicaments ought to be, out of which theſe potions are prepared, and what virtues theſe potions have in them. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whenas yet notwithſtanding they are moſt of them Aſtringent, they think that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adminiſtred they bring more hurt then good and benefit unto the Patient; in regard that they obſtruct the Liver and the other more noble bowels.</p>
                  <p>But in very truth, it is not indeed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that among the more Ancient Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (to the beſt of my Remembrance) we ſcarcely meet with any mention made as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theſe Medicaments: and yet among the Phyſitians of latter times very frequent and common hath been the uſe of them. And yet nevertheleſs thoſe things that <hi>Galen</hi> hath in the 5. of this <hi>Method, Chap.</hi> 9. touching potions in Wounds of the Thorax, thoſe things (I ſay) ſeem to come very neer unto theſe, and to ſuit and anſwer unto theſe poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

And theſe have been likewiſe uſed by others, and thoſe not only Empiricks, but alſo moſt learned, able, and skilful Phyſitians and Chirurgeons; <hi>Guido</hi> (part 2. of his little Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, Chap. 9. <hi>John de Vigo, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.) <hi>Johannes Anglicus, Nicolaus Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, Epiſt.</hi> 38. <hi>Johannes Tragant.

Num.</hi> 181. And others (a great many more of them) whom experience taught, that theſe potions were exceeding uſeful in the Curing of Wounds. And therefore, to oppoſe and thwart experience, and to reject, or neglect Medicaments approved of by long uſe and practiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a thing no way fit to be done. For as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth (in his 5. <hi>B.</hi> of the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected places,</hi> and 3. <hi>Chap.) It is better</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="2665" facs="tcp:49110:170"/> he) <hi>to ſeek out how things that are done are wrought and affected, then to deny that they may at all be done.</hi> Neither is this ſufficient for the rejection of Medicaments, that there hath bin no mention made of them in the Books of the Ancients; for many moſt uſeful Medicaments have been found out by thoſe of latter times, that the Ancients were altogether ignorant of. Neither are they adminiſtred for that end that Topicks are, or thoſe potions of which <hi>Galen</hi> maketh mention, in his 4. <hi>B.</hi> of the <hi>Meth. of Curing, Chap.</hi> 7. And therefore albeit that they do not externally reach ſo far as the wounded parts, as other Topicks; yet nevertheleſs, they may through the Veins penetrate even unto the very Wounds themſelves. Neither by Reaſon of their aſtringent virtue which certain of them have from thoſe Medicaments is there any cauſe to fear that therefore they cannot penetrate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the exterior Members; or that they are likely to breed obſtructions in the Bowels. For this inconvenience may eaſily be Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and avoided by the admixture of other things that have in them rather a power of opening, then binding. Neither laſtly, are the virtues of all Medicaments to be valued only from the firſt qualities, and ſuch as ariſe from, and depend upon them; but from the properties that ariſe from the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which are ſuggeſted unto us only by experience. But now the virtues of theſe Medicaments, although they cannot eaſily he defined, but may be manifeſted by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet notwithſtanding in this all Authors agree among themſelves, that theſe ought not to be made uſe of in the beginning, and when there is as yet no danger appearing by reaſon of the Wound, and that Topicks are ſufficient for the ful and perfect Cure; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe where there is preſent a fever and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation; which by the uſe of theſe (they being for the moſt part hot) may eaſily be augmented: but as for other Cauſes ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for this, to wit, the vitious Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the part, Wounds oftentimes do not eaſily receive a Cure; and thereupon it is that they may happily and ſuccesfully be made uſe of, not only in Wounds, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in Ulcers and Fiſtula's. For it is a thing that is very much Material, how the wounded part and the blood therein are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; and what things ſoever they are that hurt the Wound, they all of them are for the moſt part communicated unto the Wound by the fault of the Blood; as <hi>Tragautius</hi> tels us in the 2. <hi>B.</hi> of his <hi>Chirurgical Inſtitut. Chap.</hi> 12. And it being ſo, as we ſee, that ſome kind of meats are more fit and Convenient for woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſons, and ſome again offenſive and hurtful: why may we not therefore give the Patient to drink ſuch Medicaments as cauſe that all things in the Blood and about the affected part may be rightly diſpoſed, and in good order? Touching which, <hi>Ambroſe Parry</hi> (in the <hi>place before alleadged</hi>) thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: <hi>Nature being aſſiſted (ſaith he) by ſuch a potion, hath often ſeemed to me to work effects wonderful and Miraculous, in the recovery of bones rotten and impoſtumated, and the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.

And</hi> Pet. Andraeas Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiolus (<hi>in his</hi> 4. B. <hi>upon</hi> Dioſcorides, Chap. 16.) <hi>ſaith thus: By ſuch potions I have ſeen healed as wel the Wounds of the Thorax as thoſe of the Inteſtines, which were thought to be mortal, and altogether incurable by any help and means whatſoever.</hi> And this theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments do altogether and without fail per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, to wit, that they conſume the exceſſive humidity of the blood that is wholly unfit for agglutination; that they ſupply a due and fit matter for the generating of fleſh; and Thirdly, that by their moderate aſtriction they prevent and hinder the afflux of humors unto the wounded part. And <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liacum (Tr.</hi> 3. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.) writeth thus in the ſtile of his Age: <hi>In Ancient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in caſe of any parts Fiſtulated and Cancerated, as alſo in Blood congealed in the interior parts, and in caſe of</hi> Sanies <hi>gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Breaſt and Intrinſecal Glandules, and in Croakings of the Guts,</hi> I <hi>have ſomtimes uſed theſe potions.</hi> And out of him the very ſame hath <hi>Johannes Tragautius</hi> (in his 2. <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Chirurgic.

                     <note place="margin">The food of the Patient.</note>And as for the meat and drink of the Patient, (ſince that from the blood both the fleſh and whatſoever elſe is Neceſſary for the agglutination of the wound is generated) they ought to be ſuch from which good and pure blood may be bred; and ſuch as may not afford the leaſt occaſion and matter for many excrements, and dangerous Symptoms But meats of an ill Juice muſt heedfully be eſchewed, ſuch as Garlick, Onyons, Swines fleſh, Peaſe; and the Patient myſt altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſtain from meats that are hot, ſharp, tart and biting, and of an ill Juice; and he may only feed upon thoſe meats that yield a good Juice, and are of eaſy concoction. And let the food he takes be ſuch for the quantity thereof that it may be concucted by Nature and ſuch as may ſupply a moderate quantity of blood. For if too great abundance of blood be generated, it ſupplyeth matter fit for fluxion, inflammation, and other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. And indeed his food that he taketh ought to be in ſuch a quantity, that there may flow unto the wounded part ſo much blood as was wont to flow thither while the part was ſound and without any diſtemper; ſeeing that the wounded part if it be rendered weak and infirm is not able to concoct and aſſimilate ſo great a quantity of blood as it did before; whereupon there wil be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated either an inflammation, or great ſtore of excrements, and ſo the wound wil be made over moyſt. Let his meats likewiſe in the general be ſo ordered, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the flux of humors, rather then excite it; &amp; they ought to be altogether ſuch, that if there be any thing amiſs in the blood, and humors, it may rather correct then further augment the ſame. And if any evil accident ſhal befal the Wound, all indeavour ought to be uſed, that ſo the food may oppoſe and with ſtand the ſame. And yet nevertheleſs it is not one and the ſame kind of dyet that is fit and proper in all wounds. For if the wound be in a fleſhy part, and that there be no danger of an Inflammation, then a more plentiful dyet may be allowed: but if the wound be in the Nervous parts, and that there be danger at hand of an inflammation, then a more ſpare diet is to be preſcribed, that ſo there may flow unto the wounded part the leſs ſtore of blood, and the matter of the inflammation may be withdrawn and kept back. And indeed, by how much the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the wound is the greater, by ſo much the more ſpare ought his diet to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſo ſoon as the danger of the wound is dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, then his diet may be by degrees aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, ſo that he may feed ſomwhat more fully, but yet ſtil with a due moderation. And therefore, albeit that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his B. of <hi>Affects</hi>) ſaith, that <hi>Wounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought</hi> to be pinched and <hi>afflicted with hunger;</hi> this is not ſimply ſo to be taken; but that we are alwayes to heed the danger of the wound, and eſpecially of the inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conjoyned therewith; and according as this danger ſhal be greater or leſs, ſo the diet preſcribed may be more ful, or ought to be more ſparing, as we may ſee out of the ſame <hi>Hippocrates, in his Book of Fractures, comment</hi>

Wine is not allowable in thoſe wounds that are dangerous, and where there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or the danger of an Inflammation threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened and neer at hand; in regard that it may (by reaſon of its heat and thinneſs) be a vehicle or means to convey the humors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the part affected. And therefore <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> (in his Book of Ulcers, text 1.) writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this manner. <hi>A ſmall and moderate quantity of Meat, and the drinking of water, is moſtly fit and requiſite in all Wounds whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but yet rather in thoſe that are new and freſh then in thoſe that are old and of a long ſtanding; and then eſpecially when in the wound there is preſent an Inflammation, or if there ſhal be any feared; or when there is any danger leſt that any thing may be vitiated; or when the wounds of a joynt are attempted by an inflammation; or when there is any fear of a convulſion at hand; and laſtly, when the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath received a Wound.</hi> And therefore for thoſe that have been long accuſtomed to drink water, (and where there is no great plenty of beer) either ſimple and pure water may be adminiſtred unto the patient; or elſe a Medicate water, deſtilled out of the <hi>juice</hi> of <hi>Pomgranates, Coriander ſeed, Citron rinds,</hi> of <hi>Barley water,</hi> or the water deſtilled out of the whol Citron. When the danger of the inflammation as paſt, then that wine that is thin and weak may be allowed the patient how and then.

                  <p>And furthermore, we are likewiſe to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and help the weak and infirm part by thoſe things that corroborate and ſtrengthen it; the pain (if there ſhall be any) is to be mitigated; if there be preſent any heat, it is to be altered; and at length the overgreat abundance of the blood is to be leſſened, and the vitious humors to be evacuated: and this may fitly be done either by vene-ſection, or elſe by purgation.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, if blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the body,<note place="margin">Veneſection, or blood letting</note> ſo that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be cauſe to fear the afflux there of unto the wound; it is in this caſe (unleſs it hath already before much flown forth) very fit to open a vein, and let forth a due quantity thereof; Touching which <hi>Celſus</hi> (in his fifth Book, and 16. <hi>Chap.</hi>) ſaith thus; <hi>The Phyſitian ought to take forth ſome of the blood, thereby to cauſe a dryneſs;</hi> And preſently he adds; <hi>let the blood therefore flow forth more abundantly, that ſo there may be the more abundant dryneſs: but if it flow not forth ſufficiently, let the vein be opened as much as may be; if it be ſo that the patient hath ſtrength enough to bear this loſs of blood.</hi> And this is chiefly to be done in great wounds, in which there is cauſe to fear an Afflux of the blood, by reaſon of the pain of the Wounded part; and here in this caſe blood is likewiſe to be drawn forth, albeit that it doth not over-greatly abound in the body: whereupon <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his Book of the Joynts) in the bruiſing and wounding of a Rib, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
<pb n="2670" facs="tcp:49110:173"/> the taking forth of blood out of the Arm; where <hi>Galen</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon the place, addeth; <hi>Although (ſaith he) there be no extraordinary ſtore of blood abounding in the body, yet in thoſe; kind of blows and bruiſes we muſt have recourſe unto vene ſection, and letting out a due quantity of blood.</hi> And in his ſecond Book or the <hi>compoſition of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the places</hi>) he commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the firſt and chiefeſt place) vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection, for all pains of the head proceeding from a blow.</p>
                  <p>But now that this veneſection may perform the whol work, and that it may cauſe not only evacuation, but likewiſe revulſion; the vein is therefore to be opened a good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the part affected, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide, as elſe where we have told you, touching revulſion. Now this is to be done with al ſpeed poſſibly, even the very firſt day of the wound and indeed before there be any medicament adminiſtred, that ſo the afflux of the blood unto the wounded part may be prevented.</p>
                  <p>As for the quantity of the blood to be let forth, it ought to be according to the ſtore that is in the body; and according likewiſe to the ſtrength of the Patient, and his ability to bear it. And therefore if there flowed forth much blood before, then veneſection is to be omitted. But if there flowed forth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no blood before, then you may now let forth a due proportion thereof; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies according to the ſtrength of the Patient and no otherwiſe: which you may beſt of al know by the Age of the wounded perſon, the habit of his body, the time of the yeer, and other Circumſtances; touching which we have already ſpoken in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>But now, if vitious humors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the body then there wil be need of purging.<note place="margin">Purging.</note> For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo that the Wound is ſo much the more ſucceſfully and more ſpeedily cured, by how much the more ſound the part is, and of a good conſtitution; and that the ill conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wounded part doth much hinder the cure: we are therefore by all means po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible to do our indeavor, that ſo the vitious humors may not flow unto the part affected.</p>
                  <p>And thereupon ſeeing that by occaſion of the Wound it may very eaſily come to paſs that they may flow unto the part affected: if they be found in the body, they are forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be evacuated. And this is to be done in great wounds and where we have cauſe to fear leſt that by reaſon of pain the depraved humors ſhould ruſh unto the wounded part; as alſo in thoſe wounds where there is any kind of cutting or dilating to be uſed, and where any bones is to be made bare of its fleſh; and in a word, in al wounds whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wherein the pain is more vehement then ordinary. But ſmal Wounds, and ſuch likewiſe as are free from pain may be cured even without any purging: but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding if the belly be bound, it is then to be opened and looſened with a Clyſter.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome indeed that are utterly againſt purgations in any wound whatſoever,<note place="margin">Whether thoſe that are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> as fearing leſt that the humors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much ſtirred and diſturbed by the ſayd purgations ſhould flow ſo much the more unto the wounded part. But <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> admitteth of them; as we may ſee in his fourth Book of <hi>affections,</hi> touching <hi>Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Text</hi> 48. <hi>Comment.</hi> 3. and <hi>Galen in the fourth Book, of his Method of curing, Chapt.</hi> 4. <hi>and</hi> 6. And indeed reaſon it ſelf perſwadeth hereunto. For if hot, thin, and cholerick humors abound in the body, they render the blood very apt for motion; and then by means of pain and want of reſt they eaſily become hot and are inflamed, and ſo afford an occaſion for a feaver.</p>
                  <p>But now, albeit that all the vitious humors abounding in the body, are to be evacuated; yet notwithſtanding, (as we have ſayd) more eſpecially the hot, Cholerick, and wheyiſh humors are to be evacuated; which are more apt for motion and flowing; and ſuch as make much for the generating of inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Eryſipelaſes, and ſuch as do very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily excite feavers. Even at the very firſt beginning a purgation is to be appointed, to wit, before ever there be any afflux excited, and that any feaver ſhall happen. But if there hath already happened any feaver, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation cannot then ſo conveniently and ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (but indeed with ſome kind of danger) be inſtituted and appointed.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to purge (in Wounds) there are moſt fitly and ſafely to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, <hi>Manna, Syrup of Roſes Solutive, Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, the Leaves of Sene:</hi> and of compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Tryphera Perſica Elect. de Pſyllio, Elect. of Roſes of Meſues.</hi> But we muſt abſtain from the hotteſt purging medicaments; leſt that there ſhould thereby be excited an afflux of humors, that might diſpoſe the wounded part unto an imflammation. But in what manner the purgation is rightly to be ordered, we have elſewhere already ſhewn you.</p>

                  <p>AS touching the wounded parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, oftentimes by reaſon of them there is ſomething that is peculiar to be done in the Curing of wounds. How and after what manner the Cure of the wounds of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate parts is to be rightly ordered, we have already told you in thoſe places which we ſhall afterward alleadg. In the general, the wounds of the Veins, Arteries, Nerves and Nervous parts, do require a peculiar and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per kind of Cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in Wounds:</note>And Firſt of all, indeed, the Wounds of the Veins and the greater Arteries have this peculiar unto themſelves, to wit, that there is alwaies ſome notable Haemorrhage to accompany them; which oftentimes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Faintings and Swoundings, and other dangerous Symptoms. But now the Blood floweth either out of the Veins, or out of the Arteries; and of theſe, ſomtimes indeed out of the greater, and ſometimes out of the leſſer; and either out of one alone, or elſe out of many. And although that the wound infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon the Veſſel be the prime and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſe of the Haemorrhage; yet it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth (and that very often alſo) that the blood may indeed now and then be ſtopt for a while, and yet it may afterwards ſuddenly break forth again; and this more eſpecially chanceth upon the Commotion of the minde and provocation to anger. And ſo likewiſe the preſence of the Patients Adverſary, that gave him the wound, maketh greatly for the cauſing of a new and freſh Haemorrhage in the Wound: for which very Cauſe it is ſomtimes found by experience, that the Blood that was before ſtanched and ſtopt, begins again to flow forth a freſh. And I my ſelf remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that one Brother having wounded ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and while the Wound was binding up the Brother that gave the Wound coming in to viſit the other, (albeit that they were now reconciled) the Blood ſuddenly brake forth afreſh; and this without doubt from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret commotion of the minde; for upon his departure, and being forbidden to give any more viſits, the Blood again ſtanched.</p>

                     <head>Signs Diagnoſtick.</head>
                     <p>But now, ſeeing that the Blood floweth either out of the Veins, or elſe out of the Arteries; that which floweth forth of the Veins is more thick, more black and dark, and leſs hot; and it floweth forth without any great violence and ruſhing, and with an equal pulſe, and doth far leſs deject the ſpirits, (all things elſe being anſwerable) then that which cometh forth of the Arteries. But now that that cometh out of the Arteries may rather be ſaid to leap forth with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, then to flow; and in the pouring out it is more hot and fervent, more thin, more yellow, and more frothy; and it is evermore accompanied with ſome notable change and alteration in the Pulſe, together with a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dejection of the Patients ſtrength. If it be one of the greater Veſſels that is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then the Blood floweth forth in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abundance, and with ſo much the greater violence; but with far leſ, if it be one of the leſs Veſſels that is opened, and wounded. But now, what Vein or Artery it is that is wounded, and whether only one or more of them be wounded, this muſt be known from thoſe that are expert in Anatomy.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="prognosis">
                     <head>Prognoſticks.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. An overgreat Haemorrhage in Wounds is very dangerous: for the Blood is the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Life; and when the vital ſpirits are called forth, it cauſeth a weakneſs of the Pulſe, (it being ſo ſmal that it can hardly be diſcerned) as alſo a frequency and inequality thereof, and ſomtimes an intermiſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, a fainting and ſwounding, a <hi>Syncope,</hi> an extream Coldneſs and Chilneſs of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and inordinate ſweats, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, ſighings and ſobbings, Deliries, and at length death it ſelf. And hence it is that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in the 5. <hi>Sect. of his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm. Aphor.</hi> 3.) ſaith, <hi>that a Convulſion or Sighing happening upon an abundant flux of the Blood is alwaies very evil and dangerous.</hi> And in the 7. <hi>Sect. Aphoriſm.</hi> 9. <hi>that a Deliry, or a Convulſion alſo happening from the abundant flowing forth of the Blood is evil and ful of danger.</hi> And indeed it is ſo much the more dangerous, if a Convulſion be joyned with a Deliry, and that the Deliry happen not alone without the Convulſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And this is more eſpecially cauſed by the effuſion of the Arterial Blood, in regard that with it there is very much of the heat flowing in, as alſo the vital Spirits that are moſt chiefly Neceſſary for the preſervation of the life, poured forth and diſſipated.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And moreover alſo, for this reaſon the Wounds of the Arteries are more dangerous then the Wounds of the Veins, becauſe that they are more difficultly Cured and Conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, by reaſon of their hardneſs, their perpetual motion, and the violent ruſhing forth of the Arterial Blood.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="2672" facs="tcp:49110:175"/>4. And thoſe Wounds of the Arteries are yet likewiſe far more dangerous (and bring a long with them a greater Haemorrhage, and ſuch as is more difficult to Cure) that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted according to the length of the Artery, or rranſverſly, or obliquely, then thoſe in which the whole Artery is cut aſſunder, as experience it ſelf teſtifyeth; ſo that indeed, (and as the Phyſitians are wont to perſwade) if the Haemorrhage cannot otherwiſe be ſtopt and ſtanched, in regard that the whole Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not cut quite through, it is then wholly to be cut aſſunder in a tranſverſe manner. For if that the Artery be thus tranſverſly cut in twain, it will again be contracted, and its orifices will again cloſe and ſhut; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they wil the more eaſily meet and grow together again, and the ſooner be covered and ſhut up by the circumjacent fleſh lying round about it; neither will the Wound ſo gape and ſtand ſo wide, while the Artery is dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But if that the Artery be Cut long waies, or obliquely, (or if it be wholly cut aſſunder any otherwiſe then tranſverſly) ſince that it is moved with the continual motion of the Dilatation and Contraction, by this motion, and eſpecially the diſtention, the Wound is more dilated, and in every Diaſtole it gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; whereupon the Blood is poured, and leapeth forth with violence and ruſhing.</p>

                  <div type="cure">
                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>As in every over great Haemorrhage, ſo likewiſe in this that proceedeth from a wound, we meet with a twofold indication; the one, that which the wounded Veſſels themſelves ſuggeſt unto us, which requireth a Union and Glutination. The other that which the Haemorrhage ſuggeſteth; which if it be exceſſive and overgreat (ſo that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth the ſtrength and powers of the Body) requireth that it be ſtanched, even before ever that the Veſſels be ſhut up, and united. For whereas unto the Union of the Veſſels there is ſome ſpace oftimes required, (ſo that the Patient may in the mean while run a great hazard of his Life) the Blood is therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be ſtanched.</p>
                     <p>That the Flux of the Blood therefore may be ſtopt (although that the Wound of the Veſſel be not as yet grown cloſe together) al thoſe things are to be performed which may hinder and inhibite the motion thereof. Now the Flux of Blood it impeded, if with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Remedies, and the binding up, the orifice of the wound be cloſed and ſhut up. In which manner if the Blood cannot be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that it alſo break through the Wound cloſed and ſhut up in any manner whatſoever, and all by reaſon of the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous violence of the Blood, then all thoſe things that do any waies help forward the violent motion of the Blood are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, ſuch as are, the overgreat abundance of the Blood ſtirring up and continually provoking the expulſive faculty; Anger, drinking of Wine, hot and thin Humors (as it were) continually boyling up, and over violent motions of the Body: as likewiſe of an Artery, if it be not wholly cut in ſunder, the motion thereof, the declining and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Scituation of the member, and the like; and hitherto alſo may be referred the pain and heat in the part, which attracteth the Blood; and in this caſe that that violently and impetuouſly ruſheth unto the wounded part is to be turned another way.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all therefore, that the orifice of the Wound may be cloſed and ſhut up, we ought to uſe the utmoſt of our endeavour that this may be done. Now this is to be effected two waies; either by the Joyning together of the Lips of the wounded Veſſels; or by the ſtopping of the orifice of the Wound. The Lips of the Wound may be joyned together, either by preſſing together with the Fingers the orifice of the Wound, ſo long until the Blood be clotted, ſo that the thick and clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Blood may it ſelf obſtruct and ſtop the orifice of the Veſſel, that ſo the Mouth and Lips of the Veſſel may touch and cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or elſe the orifices are to be drawn cloſe together by Swathes. But now, it is very rare that we may keep our Finger upon the orifice of the Wound until the Blood be clotted, ſo as to ſtop and obſtruct the ſaid orifice: neither hath this any place in the wounded Arteries, ſince that the Arterial blood, by reaſon of its thinneſs and heat, and the motion of the Artery, doth not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (if at al) Clod in the orifice of the wound. Neither alſo may the Veins (if they lie deep) be eaſily drawn and kept cloſe together by Swathes, neither yet may their orifices be preſſed together with the Fingers. And therefore the ſafeſt Courſe is, that we do the beſt we can that ſo the orifice of the Veſſel pouring forth blood may be ſtopt. And this that it may be done artificially, let the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Wound be ſhut up and cloſed with the Finger, as much as poſſibly it may be done; but if it be ſo that the orifice it ſelf of the Veſſel cannot be reached unto by the Fingers, then that branch of the Vein that poureth forth the Blood there in that place whereby it rendeth to the Wound, is firſt of all (in the place neereſt unto the Wound) to be preſſed very hard together with the finger; and the Wound to be cleanſed from al humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; and then after this there is immediatly a Medicament that will ſtop and ſtanch the Blood to be impoſed. Which that it may
<pb facs="tcp:49110:175"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:49110:176"/>
                        <pb n="2673" facs="tcp:49110:176"/> be rightly and duly performed, the wound is not only to be loaden and raſhly oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (a thing wherein I have ſeen many Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons greatly to offend) with too many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tringent Medicaments; but we ought to uſe the beſt of our endeavor, that the very ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the wound be inſtantly (and that very cloſe and ſtrictly) ſhut up. For unleſs this be done, albeit there be never ſo many of theſe kind of Medicaments impoſed; yet nevertheleſs if the orifice of the veſſel be not cloſe ſhut up, and obſtructed, the blood wil by it break forth, and ſo make void all the labor and pains the Chirurgeons have been at, and all the former proviſion (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great) that they have made. Now for the ſtopping and ſtanching of the blood in this manner, there is hardly any thing to be named that wil more conveniently do it (as daily experience teſtifieth,) then that kind of Muſhrom dryed (they commonly call it, <hi>Crepitus Lupi,</hi> or Woolfs fart) that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually groweth, and is to be found up and down in Vineyards. For it being of a nature moſt dry, as it will no way admit of the flowing forth of the blood (which thoſe Medicaments do that are naturally moyſt, and therefore they are but little or nothing uſeful for the ſtanching of the blood) ſo it will ikewiſe cauſe that it ſubſiſt and ſtick faſt in the veſſel. But now this is moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially uſeful and beneficial, if it be firſt with a thread tyed together, and a weight layed thereon, or elſe preſſed down and kept cloſe together with a preſs wrung down hard upon it. For ſo, when it comes afterward to be impoſed upon the wound, it again dilateth it ſelf, and ſo ſtoppeth up the orifice of the wound.</p>

Make up this mixture in thoſe ſoft hayrs (or flix) of a hare; and ſo lay it upon the veſſel, and the whol wound. And afterwards in a fit and convenient manner bind up the wound with a ſwath; and then at length open and unbind it again on the third day.

But the truth is, this way is not ſafe enough, but ful of peril. For ſeeing that ſo much of the Particle as is burnt into a cruſt, ſo much there falleth away of the Natural fleſh from the part; when the cruſt falleth off the orifice of the veſſel is again left nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bare of fleſh; ſo that there is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a new haemorrhage excited, and not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſtanched.

                     <p>Stupefactives are not over commonly to be adminiſtred; neither indeed at all, unleſs the ſtrength remain firm and entire; for fear leſt that the powers being already much weakned, and fayling by reaſon of the over great loſs of blood, ſhould by theſe ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factives be farther dejected: but if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſtrength wil admit of it, then we may adminiſter one grain (or two at the moſt) of <hi>Opiat Laudanum.</hi> But now that the blood when it is ſtanched may ſo remain, for this the ſituation of the wounded part maketh very much; which ought to be ſuch, that the Member may look upward, and be free from all pain. For pain doth very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily attract the blood, and cauſe it to break forth again; and the blood doth more eaſily flow unto a declining and downward place.</p>
                     <p>If yet the blood by this means be not ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; they tell us that we are then to caſt upon the veſſel pouring forth the blood ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to tye it withal; and eſpecially tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the root thereof, by which the branch looks toward the Liver, or the Heart; and that the veins or Arteryes are to be made naked and bare, to be layd hold on with a hook, and then preſently with a thread (of ſilk eſpecially) to be tyed, and the thread to be drawn very hard and cloſe upon them; and then they appoint that the wound be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up with fleſh, before the bond be quite taken off. For if the fleſh ſhal not firſt of al have filled up the place that is about the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and have ſhut the very orifice of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel it ſelf, the bond falling off, the haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage wil again eaſily follow. But the truth is that theſe things are more eaſily required and commanded, then they are put in pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice &amp; performed. If a vein or an Artery woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; pouring forth blood be wholly cut aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, the blood is then the more eaſily ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: for the veſſel is drawn back, and on both ſides contracted within it ſelf; and ſo its orifice is covered and ſhut up by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that lie round about it.</p>

                     <p>But the beſt, ſafeſt, and moſt eaſie way (if it be rightly ordered) of ſtanching the blood, is that which is wrought by Medicaments that ſtop and ſtay the Blood, and ſhut up the orifice thereof; as they were before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by us.</p>
                     <p>When the Blood ſhal be ſtopt, the Wound is ſcarcely to be opened before the third day.

But if by theſe it be made ſo moiſt, that it is ready of it ſelf to drop off, another is in this caſe to be laid on, if there be yet any further flux of blood feared. And yet notwithſtanding we are herein to deal very Cautiouſly, and with all manner of Circumſpection; and with the one hand that part of the Veſſel toward the Root thereof is to be preſſed down cloſe together, that ſo the flux of blood may be reſtrained; and with the other hand the Medicament is to betaken off, the moiſt Wound to be clean and dried, and a new Medicament laid on.</p>

                  <p>ANd moreover, the Wounds likewiſe of the Nerves, Tendons, and Ligaments, are for the moſt part of ſuch a Nature that ſomthing in the Curing of them may fal out that is peculiar and proper to them alone. And firſt of all, as for what concerns the Nerves, as alſo the Tendons, (for what we ſhall ſpeak touching the Nerves may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be applied unto the Tendons) they are of another Nature then the fleſh; and therefore alſo (as we ſhall afterward ſhew you) they require other Medicaments then the wounded fleſh doth; and furthermore they have a very quick and exquiſite ſenſe, as the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons likewiſe have; and thereupon if they be hurt they bring great Pains and Convulſions. Now the Wounds of the Nerves are twofold; to wit, Pricking and Inciſion; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the wounding Inſtrument inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Wound, either by a Prick, or a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Cut.</p>

                     <p>Now the Wound of the Nerve is known firſt of all, from the Conſideration of the wounded place; and from Anatomy, which acquaints us with the Nerves that are in every Member, and how they enter and are Scituate in them. For which cauſe, it is likewiſe to be conſidered, whether the wound be in the Heads of the Muſcles, or in the ends of them: and whether the wound be above upon the Joynts, or elſe in the very Joynts themſelves: for if it be in the Heads of the Muſcles, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth that a Nerve is wounded; but if it be in the ends, and neer the Joynts, it is a ſign then that a Tendon is wounded. And moreover, from the vehement pain that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the receiving of the wound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth the wounded perſon, unleſs the whole Nerve be cut aſſunder tranſverſwiſe or over thwart. For the Nerves have a very quick and exquiſite ſenſe; and therefore, when theſe are prickt, there inſtantly ariſeth in the wounded part a vehement pain, and upon this an inflammation; and ſo the Brain being drawn into a Conſent, oftentimes Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Deliries are excited. But now the Tendons, although they are not endued with a ſenſe altogether ſo quick and exquiſite; yet
<pb n="2675" facs="tcp:49110:179"/> nevertheleſs, even theſe (they being not wholly void of ſenſe and feeling) when they are pricked, there are alſo pains, and from thence Convulſions excited.</p>

Neither is that putridneſs and Corruption conteined in the wounded part alone, but it is likewiſe communicated unto the neer neighbouring parts, yea and oftentimes alſo unto thoſe parts that are more remote. Whereupon it is, that the hand being wounded, or but the Finger only, the pains are wont to appear in the Arm and Shoulder; and that the Leg being hurt, there are wont to be in the Thigh not only pains, but alſo Impoſtumations; and that the Malady is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not unto one of the ſides alone, but even unto that alſo that is oppoſite. Yea and in the whole Body likewiſe the Humors are corrupted; whereupon feavers, pains in the ſides, and Dyſenteries are wont to be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And (that which we are here to give you notice of, and not to paſs it over in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) there are not evermore preſent ſigns that betoken an Inflammation or putridneſs; yea and oftentimes there are likewiſe preſent no vehement pains; but that very often ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and ſuddenly the Convulſion invadeth the wounded perſons. For the vitious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being thin and depraved is hiddenly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the Nerves unto the Brain, (as we ſee that this is done in the Epilepſie or Falling-ſickneſs) a poyſonous Air aſcending unto the brain from the extream parts, without any notable pain in thoſe parts by and through which it paſſeth. Of which thing we meet with many examples, and how that the wounded perſons, without any pain and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, have been ſuddenly ſurpriſed with a Convulſion, and have inſtantly died thereupon. And therefore in the Wounds of the Nerves, although that there ſhall be no pain felt, neither any Inflammation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing; yet notwithſtanding, we are not to truſt to this; but for all this the Cure is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be heeded and attended.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>Touching the Curing of the Wounded Nerves, <hi>Galen</hi> (in his ſixth Book of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of healing, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.) taketh a great deal of pains in treating thereof. But ſeeing that in all Wounds of the Nerves pains and inflammations eaſily make their approach, and threaten the patient, we muſt endeavor that the pain may be mitigated, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation prevented. And therefore if need require, both by letting forth of the blood, as alſo by a purging out of the ſharp and thin humors, their afflux unto the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted part is to be reſtrained and prevented: but the wound it ſelf is to be kept open, that ſo the excrements may the more freely flow forth. For the Chiefeſt cauſe of pain in Wounds of the nerves is the excrementitious matter ſhut up; which being over long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned getteth to it ſelf a depraved quality, pulleth and twingeth the Nerves, and at length putrifieth. And therefore thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments that are called <hi>Enemata</hi> (although they may be very fit and proper in bloody Wounds, and thoſe of the fleſhy parts, in regard that they ſpeedily cloſe &amp; ſhut up the wound, yet) here in this caſe are no waies convenient. Neither is water fit &amp; proper nor yet any thing that is cold; ſince that (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writeth in his fifth ſection, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſ.</hi> 18.) <hi>every thing that is cold is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the bones, teeth, Nerves, Brain, ſpinal marrow; but that which is warm, a friend unto them.</hi> Yea neither ought other Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are actually cold to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto the wounded parts. For ſeeing that the Nerves are parts voyd of blood, and having in them but very little natural and inhate heat, and endued with a moſt: exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſenſe, they are ſoon and eaſily offended by any thing that is cold, (it being biting and cauſing pain) as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writeth in the 20. <hi>Aphor.</hi> of his fifth <hi>Section,</hi> and as <hi>Galen</hi> likewiſe teacheth thus, in the ſixth Book of his <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Curing, Chapt.</hi> 3. But yet things that are blood-warm are not ſufficiently commodious; touching which <hi>Galen</hi> (in his ſixth Book of the <hi>Compoſit:</hi> of <hi>Medicaments according to the kind, Chapt.</hi> 2. thus writeth <hi>Let the oyl (ſayth he) with which we cheriſh the wound be ſufficiently hot, leſt that otherwiſe it offend ſuch a wounded part. For like as that which is cold is moſt of all contrary unto theſe kind of Affects; ſo likewiſe that that is but blood warm is not very much a friend unto them.</hi> And a little after: <hi>and for this Reaſon (ſayth be) I my ſelf chuſe rather to make uſe of a fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of oyl that is ſufficiently hot, alwaies ſhunning that which is but luke-warm, but moſt of al refuſing that which is quite cold.</hi> And yet Nevertheleſs, if there be a nerve diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made bare, <hi>Galen</hi> then adminiſtreth rather ſuch things as are but tepid or Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, then thoſe things that are very hot; as we may find in the ſixth Book of his <hi>Method of Curing,</hi> and <hi>Chapt.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>But although that for the aſſwaging of the pain, that which is hot and withal moyſt is moſt uſeful and convenient: yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, in regard that under thoſe things that humectate and moyſten the Nerves do eaſily putrefy, therefore for all Wounds of the Nerves thoſe Medicaments are moſt accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and proper that in their activity are temperate, (or ſomwhat tending unto heat) but that in paſſives do dry; and that are of thin parts, that may corroborate the weak heat of the Nerves, by conſuming and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the excrements: touching which <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> (in his ſixth Book of the <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and 2 <hi>Chapt.</hi>) writeth in this manner: <hi>The faculty of the Medicaments of the wounded Nerves ought to be both thin, and alſo moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly heating, and ſuch as may dry without any pain; in regard that this alone can draw the Sanier (or thin excrements) from the bottom of the Wound, without either contracting, or biting of the particle.</hi> And then a little after, <hi>the Wounded Nerves (ſayth he) require ſuch Medicaments that may excite a tepid or luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm heat, and may ſtrongly dry; and which from the Nature of their own ſubſtance have both a power of drawing, and are of thin parts.</hi> And the ſame he teacheth us in his third Book of the <hi>Compoſition of Medicaments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the kinds, Chapt.</hi> 2. And ſuch like Medicaments have in them this benefit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that although they are endued with a faculty of drying, yet notwithſtanding they do not conglutinate the orifice of the Wound ſeeing that they have both an attractive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and yet nevertheleſs are free from and void of an Aſtringent faculty. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding regard ought to be had unto the nature of the Wounded perſon; and unto the ſofter and more tender bodies the weaker Medicaments are to be adminiſtred; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hard and ſtrong bodies thoſe medicaments that we adminiſter may be the ſtronger. And there is alſo regard to be had unto the matter that is to be dryed up; and according to the ſtore of the humidity we are to make choice of Medicaments that are conveniently drying For as <hi>Galen</hi> (in the place laſt alleadge, to wit, the third Book of the <hi>Compoſition of Medicam. according to the places, and Chapt.</hi> 2.) ſayth that in a very copious humidity the increaſe thereof requireth to be dryed up by a Medicament that is more then ordinary dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if it be buy little, then by a medicament that doth this moderately; and if it be much,
<pb facs="tcp:49110:180"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:49110:181"/>
                        <pb n="2679" facs="tcp:49110:181"/> hen by a Medicament that dryeth much; and yet nevertheleſs, not extremly, neither in the higheſt degree. For there ought to be a proportion anſwerable between the quantity of the humidity and the drying of the Medicament. And if there be alſo any of thoſe drying Medicaments, and of thin parts, (which are of fit uſe in all Wounds of the Nerves) that have adjoyned with them a Notable heat, and a biting Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and thereupon may eaſily excite both pain and fluxions, (ſuch as are deſtilled Balſams, ſpirits, and oyls) their heat and acrimony (unleſs of its own accord it ſoon vaniſheth, as it commonly happeneth in the ſpirit of Wine) is to be tempred and Mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the mingling together of other things with them.</p>
                     <p>Such like Medicaments as theſe, that are uſeful in all Wounds of the Nerves, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Galen</hi> in his ſixth Book of the <hi>Method of Curing, Chapt.</hi> 2. and in his third Book of the <hi>Compoſite</hi> of <hi>Medicam. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the kinds, Chapt.</hi> 3. 4. and 7. and they ſhal be likewiſe declared by us anon, when we come to ſpeak of the <hi>pricking</hi> of the <hi>Nerves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now that the pain may be aſſwaged, the temperament of the part preſerved, and the Afflux of humors, and the inflammation may be prevented, there are not only convenient Medicaments to be impoſed upon the part affected, (of which we ſhal ſpeak by and by) but even al the parts alſo that lie in the midſt from the wound to the beginning of the <hi>Nerves</hi> are to be anoynted and cheriſhed with hot oyls, to wit, the Oyl of Earth worms of White Lilyes, the Oyl of a Fox, the Oyl of Coſtus, the Oyl of Caſtor, and the like. And <hi>Galen</hi> commands us thus to do, in the ſixth Book of his <hi>Method, and</hi> 3 <hi>Chapt.</hi> And therefore, if the Nerve be of thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Neck, then the Arm from the Wound even unto the Armpits and the Neck, is to be anoynted. But if the nerve be of thoſe that are found in the Legg, then the Groyns are to be anoynted; and we muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend in anoynting from the Groyns (by the Backbones) even unto the head and Neck.</p>
                     <p>But ſince that the Prognoſticks, as alſo the uſe of thoſe Medicaments doth ſomwhat vary (according as the Nerve is wounded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by pricking, or by a down-right cut) we ſhal therefore ſpeak of the Pricking and inciſion of the Nerves in ſpecial; out of which thoſe things that in the general ſeem neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be ſpoken of touching the cure of the wounds of the Nerves, wil the more cleerly appear.</p>

                     <p>That Indication that is common in all the wounds of the other parts (to wit, that what is diſſolved muſt be again united) this hath likewiſe its place in the prickings of the Nerves. And yet notwithſtanding, in regard that when a Nerve is prickt, (by reaſon of the Acrimony of the ſenſe which it hath) there followeth a greater pain then in the other parts; and upon this an Inflammation: in the pricking of the Nerves therefore this ought to be the main care and endeavour of the Phyſitian, that the ſaid pain may (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly) be prevented or at leaſt mitigated and moderated, and however that the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be by all means prevented. Now this is prevented, if there be not heaped up in the wound thoſe excrements that may bring pain Now theſe may be kept from heaping up, if from all parts of the Body the vitious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors be not permitted to flow unto the part affected, to wit, the wounded place; and if that thoſe which are gotten together in the wound be not ſuffered thereto continue, but be forthwith evacuated: Which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed if the Skin, as likewiſe the wound of the fleſh that lieth upon the Nerve, be kept open; or if the wound ſhall not be open enough, that it be made yet wider, and the Skin cut wider by two inciſions made at the right Angles, that ſo by it there may be opened a more free paſſage forth for thoſe Excrements that are heaped up in the Wound.</p>
                     <p>And therefore in the pricking of the Nerves there are three things principally to be done; firſt the Body is to be purged from vitious Humors, the pain to be mitigated, and a paſſage made for the Excrements, that ſo they may be emptied forth and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                     <p>But now after what manner the whol body is to be purged, we have often told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But upon the wounded part there are Medicaments to be impoſed, which both mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the pain, and open a paſſage forth for the <hi>Sanies</hi> or thin Excrements, and that draw forth the Excrements that lie hid very deep, even at the bottom of the Wound. And if the wound be over narrow, it is then to be made wider either by a Section made acroſs (in the form of the Letter X) ſo that the prick be the Center of the Sections, or elſe by Tents that may dilate the Skin, but yet not touch the Nerve.</p>
                     <p>And yet nevertheleſs, for the moderating of the pain, neither is warm water, or that that is hot and moiſt, thought to be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; (ſince that Water and all cold things are enemies unto the Nerves; and thoſe things that are hot and moiſt may eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a putridneſs in the Nerves:) but we ought rather to uſe Oyl of a thin ſubſtance, as that of <hi>Earth-Worms,</hi> or ſuch like. And it will be likewiſe to very good purpoſe, to anoynt the part about the wound with Oyl ſomwhat warm, of moſt thin parts, and not aſtringent. Or, if you cannot get enough of ſuch an Oyl, then uſe the Oyl of white Lillies, of Earth-worms, or Camomile, of Dil, or of Melilote. But if the pain ſhall not yet ceaſe, and that an Inflammation be nigh at hand, it will then be very requiſite to impoſe ſome Cataplaſm to qualifie and mitigate the pain; and this may be made of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rley Meal, Bean Meal, the Meal of the Vetch Ervum, and that of Lupines, Betony, Camomile flowers, and Oyl fully ripe.</hi> For ſuch like Cataplaſms do aſſwage pain, throughly dry, and diſcuſs, reſiſt putridneſs, Cheriſh and ſtrengthen the Native heat; and therefore in the wounds of the Nerves and Tendons they are very fitly adminiſtred: and eſpecially, ſuch are then to be made uſe of, when the Nerves begin to be enflamed, and to putrifie; and then thoſe Cataplaſms are to be made with Oxymel or elſe with a Ley; and the ſame Cure (almoſt) is to be inſtituted, and in the ſame manner to be ordered, as it is wont to be in a Gangrene but now begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>And therefore in this all Authors agree, and Practiſe it ſelf and experience teach us this, that in all prickings of the Nerves we ought to abſtain from all things cold, Aſtringent, and moiſt; and that we are to uſe thoſe things that are hot, dry, and having a thin ſubſtance: or (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith) all our Care and Counſel muſt be directed and tend unto this, that the faculty of the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be both thin, as alſo meanly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently heating, and ſuch as may dry without any pain. For theſe alone can draw from the bottom of the wound the <hi>Sanies</hi> or thin Excrement, without either contracting or biting any the leaſt part thereof.</p>
                     <p>But although that this indeed be out of doubt, that the Medicaments that are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto the prickings of the Nerves have ſuch a like faculty (as ere while we told you of) to wit, to dry up and diſcuſs the thin Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and to draw from the bottom of the wounds; but then whether they yet do nothing elſe but this, and whether their being adminiſtred be to no other end, of this I much doubt. And that which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me ſo to doubt, is that which hath been ſpoken above in the <hi>eight Chapter,</hi> touching
<pb n="2681" facs="tcp:49110:182"/> Sarcoticks. For whereas in that place I have ſhewn, that it is not at all abſurd to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that the chief and principal end of all Sarcotick Medicaments is this, that they may Corroborate the heat of any part whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that ſo Nature in the generating of fleſh may ſo much the more rightly diſcharge its office; this is eſpecially requiſite in the wounded Nerves, Tendons, and Ligaments. For ſince their heat is far more weak then that of the fleſhy parts, this heat is yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther debilitated in thoſe that are wounded; and therefore they are not able rightly to Concoct and Aſſimilate the Aliment that floweth unto them; and from hence it is, that this Aliment is converted into <hi>Sanies;</hi> and by how much the greater the weakneſs is, by ſo much the greater is the ſtore of ſuch <hi>Sanies</hi> that floweth out. And moreover in regard that the Nervous parts are endued with a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe, they are eaſily affected with a pain likewiſe; upon occaſion of which the vitious Humors flow unto them from al other parts of the Body. And from hence it very often happeneth, that from the wounded Joynts, (and eſpecially in the Arm, or Knee; and yet more eſpecially, if there be preſent an Inflammation) there is never any laudable <hi>Pus</hi> generated, but there floweth forth great ſtore of this <hi>Sanies,</hi> which our Chirurgeons cal <hi>das Glied VVaſſel,</hi> or the <hi>Joynt Water;</hi> and ſome of the more ignorant of theſe Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons think it to be the genuine Humor of the Joynt it ſelf; and thereupon they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obſtruct and ſtop the afflux thereof, by I know not what kind of Medicaments; when as notwithſtanding there cannot be conteined ſo much Humor in all the Joynts of the whole Body, as we ſhall ſomtimes have flowing forth of ſuch a wound in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For the old (which is more yellow and more Pale then the New, but more hard and dry of Conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) is leſs efficacious; and although that it keep ſome of its virtue unto the third yeer, yet in the fourth, fifth, or ſixth yeer, it is then ſo decaied, that in the proceſs of time it is altogether uſeleſs and good for nothing. And therefore the new is to be mingled with a triple quantity of <hi>Wax.</hi> As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Euphorbium, one ounce; Wax, three ounces; Oyl, ten or twelve ounces.</hi>

                     <p>But when it is become a little old, it ought then to be mingled in ſomwhat a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; and there muſt be added thereto one part and half (or two parts if it be three or four yeers old) more then formerly when it was new: that is to ſay, a double weight unto the former; or if you pleaſe it may in weight be equal unto the <hi>Wax,</hi> in which thing notwithſtanding uſe is much to be heeded and attended. For if the wounded perſon ſhall complain of any biting that he feels from the ſaid Medicament; and the parts lying about the Puncture ſhall appear to be hot, then the Puncture or Pricking it ſelf is ſomwhat more ſwelling then is fit, and the Lips of the wound wil be ſome thing affected with an Inflammation; and we may conclude that the Medicament is ſtronger then it ought to be: and therefore either the ſtrength of it is to be abated and qualified by the admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the greater ſtore of Oyl, or elſe the older <hi>Euphorbium</hi> is to be taken. But if the Contrary ſhall happen, then the ſtrength of the Medicament is to be augmented, either by mingling a greater quantity of the old, or elſe by the admixture of the newer <hi>Euphorbium:</hi> for that mixture that hath in it a triple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>Wax,</hi> is the ſtrongeſt; that which

                     <p>The pain, if the Nerve be Wounded by a Cut, but not wholly divided and cut aſſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is not ſo great as if it be Wounded by a prick: and yet nevertheleſs for the moſt part it is even great enough. But if the Nerve be wholly cut aſſunder, there is then no pain at all felt, but yet nevertheleſs the ſenſe and feeling, or elſe the motion of the part into which the Nerve is inſerted, is taken away. And ſo likewiſe if the Tendon be wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected, the motion of the Member is taken away.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. If the Nerve be Wounded in the length thereof, then there is no great fear of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, ſeeing that the fibres are not ſo much affected: but if it be wounded tranſverſly, and yet not wholly cut in two, it may indeed bring upon the perſon all thoſe ſymptoms (to wit, pains, inflammations, a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Deliryes or Dotings) which the pricking of the Nerve doth: becauſe that from the fibres that are cut aſſunder the pain and hurt is communicated unto thoſe fibres that are not diſſected and divided; and from hence proceed pains, fluxions, inflammations, and other evils; and at length the Malady is communicated unto the brain it ſelf; from whence there ariſe Convulſion fits and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if the Nerve be wholly diſſected, it doth not indeed bring along with it ſo much danger, neither is there any fear of a Convulſion: but yet nevertheleſs there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other incurable Malady that followeth it, to wit, a debility both in ſenſe and motion of that part into which the Nerve is inſerted, whenas the animal ſpirit can no longer be carried by the Nerve into the ſaid part.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If any Tendon ſhall be wounded, but not wholly diſſected, it cauſeth a debility of motion in that part that it moveth: but if it be altogether cut aſſunder, then the motion of the ſaid part is altogether aboliſhed and taken away.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>The way and Method of Curing theſe Wounds is in the moſt the very ſame indeed with that which we mentioned in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chapter;</hi> yet notwithſtanding there are ſome things that are peculiarly to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As firſt of all, thoſe Nerves that are wounded by a downright cut are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly left naked, and bare of any skin to cover them and therefore we are to uſe our beſt endeavor, that they may not be expoſed unto the external Air, in regard that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cold Air (as we have often told you) is an enemy unto the Nerves. And therfore we are to do the utmoſt of our indeavor, that (as much as poſſibly may be) they may be covered with their own proper covering, and the skin that lieth upon it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Nerve be wounded according unto
<pb n="2684" facs="tcp:49110:184"/> its length, then with a ſwath the lipps of the Wound are to be drawn together and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; but if the Wound be tranſverſe, and that neceſſity ſo require, there is then a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or ſewing of the lips to be attempted; and yet great care muſt be taken, and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence uſed, that (if the ſuture or ſtiching be wrought with the needle, which yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding may eaſily be avoyded, as we told yon before) the Nerve it ſelf be not touched with the Needle. For if in the ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſhould chance to be prickt, the very ſame ſymptoms may happen that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wont to ariſe in the pricking of the Nerves. And yet nevertheleſs the wound is ſo to be drawn together, that there may ſtill ſtand open a free paſſage forth for the <hi>Sanies;</hi> which (if need ſo require) may be done with a Tent; leſt that if the ſaid <hi>Sanies</hi> be retained and kept in, it ſhould corrupt and putrify the nerve. The nerves alſo when they are wounded will not bear thoſe ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger biting Medicaments, of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> and the like. And therefore in ſuch kind of Wounds as theſe <hi>Galen</hi> was wont to uſe a Medicament of quick or unſlaked Lime often waſhed with much oyl of roſes mingled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; as alſo that Medicament of Pompho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyx, if it be mingled with good ſtore of oyl of Roſes. But thoſe Medicaments that have been found out by thoſe of latter times are ſafeſt of all other; of which we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made mention in the <hi>Chapter</hi> immediatly foregoing. But then the Wound it ſelf may be externally covered with the <hi>Emplaſter Diachalcites,</hi> or <hi>Diapalma,</hi> or the <hi>Nerve</hi> Emplaſter, or any other that ſhal be known to be ſit and convenient. <hi>Galen (in his third Book of the Compoſit. of Medicaments accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their kinds &amp; the third Chapt.)</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and mentioneth theſe kind of Emplaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and there are many likewiſe of them extant in the writings of the latter Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; of which we have alſo in the former <hi>Chapt.</hi> 8 (touching vulnerary Medicaments) made mention; and given you ſome of the Chief of them. And this Unguent is alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and uſeful; which they uſually term the Unguent for the Worms.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Centaury the leſs, the leſſer Plantain, Hounds tongue, Mouſe-care, the greater and leſſer Conſound, the herb horſe-taile, and Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foyl, of each of theſe one handful; of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms half a pound, Common oyl one pound, Wine one pint and half, Vinegar four ounces. Let them be al wel maſhed and throughly mingl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and ſo let them ſtand fermenting for ſeven daies together. And then after this, adde thereto, of the ſewet of a Ram taken clean from the skin one pound; ſhip pitch and Roſin, of each one quart. Gum Ammoniacum, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum, Opopanax, diſſolved in Vinegar, of each half a dram: let them be all boyled together over a moderate and gentle fire, until the wine and the Vinegar be all conſumed, and then let them be ſtrayned. And ſo ſoon at they ſhal be cold, add of Turpentine one ounce and half; of Frankincenſe, Maſtick, Sarcocol, of each three drams; Saffron two drams; let th m be wel ſtirred about with a Spatula, or elſe with a Peſtle in a Mortar: and if it ſeem good, to cauſe a Conſiſtence, Wax may alſo be added.</hi>

                     <p>And whereas by reaſon of the Scarcity of natural heat in the Nerves, there can hardly be made a good ſuppuration, but rather a Putridneſs and Corruption of the humors; a Cataplaſm that may inhibite and reſiſt the ſaid putridneſs is to be impoſed: which wil likewiſe perform this good office, to wit, of defending the Nerve (unto which cold is an Enemy) from the Injuries of the External Air.

But theſe Wounds are made yet the more dangerous, if there happen withal alooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of the Joynt: for then the Joynt cannot be ſet and put back again into its place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endangering the life of the Patient, by reaſon of thoſe pains that do perpetually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company theſe kind of wounds. And therfore the Phyſitian may do wel to ſave his credit by heeding the Prognoſtick, leſt that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he be il ſpoken of by the common ſort of people. For otherwiſe, if he wil adventure to put back the Joynt into its former place, and that the Joynt when it is put back ſo continue, it bringeth death unto the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and it hath been commonly ſeen, that upon a very ſmal Wound death hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For when with ſuch a Wound a luxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or looſeneſs of the Joynt doth happen, the Nervous parts about the Joynts do ſuffex a diſtraction; upon which there are cauſed fierce and cruel pains, and fluxions: but if he Joynt be brought back unto its place, the ſame parts are again extended; and ſo of neceſſity there muſt happen inflammations and convulſions, which unavoydably are communicated unto the Brain: and withal
<pb n="2686" facs="tcp:49110:185"/> from the afflux of the matter proceeding from ſo many diſtractions and extenſions the heat is ſuffocated, and ſo there followeth a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, and Sphacelus. Wherefore if any ſuch Wound be brought unto the Phyſitian to Cure, let him acquaint the ſtanders by with the danger of the Patients life, and let him likewiſe give them notice of the feaver that will follow, and that a Convulſion will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe happen in a very ſhort time, if this brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging back of the Joynt be attempted, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly effected. Touching which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> (in his <hi>B. of the Joynts, Text</hi> 74.) ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Ankle-bone, thus writeth: <hi>But whoſoever they be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that upon any Wound there inflicted have their Ankle-bones out of Joynt, and altogether ſticking out from the Joynts of the Foot, they ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and put back again into their places: but they are to be permitted ſo to continue: and if any Phyſitian wil adventure to put them back, let him know for a certain, that if they ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue when they are ſet, the Patients are not like to live, and that their life is like to be but for a very few daies; for there be but few of them that live beyond the ſeventh day: for that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroies them is the Convulſion. Add this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that it often happeneth, that both the Ankle and the Foot are taken with the Gangrene. And we may be moſt certainly aſſured, that theſe things will thus come to paſs.</hi> And of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, (Text 16.) he ſaith thus: <hi>The very ſame happeneth in the bones of the Elbow: for if theſe bones alſo (upon any Wound of the Hand-Wriſt) be made to ſtick forth either toward the interior or the exterior part of the Hand, we are to know for a truth, that the perſons who have theſe bones brought back and ſet in their former pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (if they ſo abide) they ſhall within a few daies die the ſame Death that we told you of before:</hi> And touching the Thigh-bone, (Text 77.) <hi>And if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Thigh-bone be fallen forth by reaſon of any Wound inflicted upon the Knee, if it be again replaced, and ſo continue, it ſpeedily bringeth a more violent Death, then in the caſes aforeſaid.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; <hi>And the very ſame is likewiſe to be ſaid as touching the Joynts of the Hand-Wriſt, and of the Arm.

Wherefore if there were no fear that the Phyſitian would be accuſed and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by reaſon of the Ignorance and unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the vulgar, there were not any one of theſe to be brought back unto their own former places.</hi> And which that the Phyſitian may the better avoid, and may not haſten the Death of the Patient, he ought not ſo much as to undertake the replacing of the Joynt. But then if the Phyſitian ſhall not order the Joynt to be brought back and ſet in its former place, he ſhall by the vulgar be accuſed of ignorance and unskilfulneſs, and as one that hath made the Patient Lame or maimed. Wherefore the Phyſitian in this Caſe is to preſerve his Credit and Reputation by the aforeſaid Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, and foretelling unto the ſtanders by the danger of Death that may in thus doing accrue unto the ſick party.</p>

                     <p>The Cure of theſe wounds, if they be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Luxation or looſening, is almoſt the ſame as was that before of the Nerves. To wit, the lips of the wound are indeed again to be drawn together, but yet not wholly, if the Wound be deeper then ordinary, that ſo there may be an open paſſage forth for the Humors that are eaſily gathered together. And ſeeing that the Joynts eſpecially have in them but little heat, they are therefore in the beſt manner that may be to defend them from the injuries of the external Air. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only thoſe Unguents and Emplaſters that are uſed in other Wounds (eſpecially thoſe of the Nerves) are to be impoſed; but likewiſe thoſe Cataplaſms, of which mention was made above in the <hi>eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pouder of Marſh-mallow Root, half an ounce; Betony, flowers of Camomile, and Melilote, of each one ounce; the meal of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed,

                     </p>
                     <p>The afflux of the Humors is likewiſe to be prevented; and therefore the whole body is to be evacuated with al diligence; and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that flow are to be intercepted, and turned quite out of the Body.</p>
                     <p>It matters very much likewiſe, that the member be rightly Scituated and placed, that the pain and the afflux of Humors may be prevented, and the action of the member preſerved.</p>
                     <p>If therefore the fore part of the Shoulder be wounded, then let a thick bolſter be put underneath the wing thereof, and likewiſe wrapt up in ſomthing that may bear up the Arm, and drive up higher the top or head of the Shoulder. For the top or head of the Shoulder being drawn downward by its own proper weight cauſeth that the Wound is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much the more ſlowly. If the Wound be inflicted upon the Joynt of the Elbow, the Arm is then neither altogether to be kept ſtretched forrh ſtraight, neither is it too much to be bended inward, but it is to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a middle poſture, reſembling an obtuſe Angle. Which Scituation of the part that it may be ſo preſerved, and by the ſick perſon whileſt he ſleepeth (or elſe through Incogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy) not altered, it is to be kept in that poſture either by fit and convenient bindings up, or elſe by wooden Inſtruments made fit for that purpoſe. The Hand-Wriſt being wounded, or the Joynts of the Fingers, the Hand is to be kept half bended, and the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers not ſtretched forth, leſt that a Cicatrice being brought over them the Hand ſhould abide ſtiff, and be hurt by its contraction. If the joynt of the Thigh be wounded, let the ſick perſon lie upon his back, and with fit little Pillows and bindings let the Huckle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone in the head thereof be contained and kept in its proper place; and until the Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice be brought over it, the ſick perſon muſt be commanded that he ſomtimes move and ſtir his Thigh this way and that way; leſt that the Cicatrice being brought over it, there ſhould happen a hurt of the motion by means of the ſaid Cicatrice. The Knee when it is wounded muſt be ſtretched forth, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a right and ſtraight Figure, that ſo Lameneſs may be prevented.</p>
                     <p>But now if the Wound be with a Luxation or looſening of the Joynt,<note place="margin">A Wound with Luxation.</note> if the Joynt that is looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned be great, the putting of it back again into its place is to be omitted; and the ſick perſon is to be told before hand of the Lameneſs and danger that would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon: and the fluxion is by all manner of means to be turned away, and the pain to be mitigated; and the Member to be placed in ſuch a poſture as may ſeem moſt grateful and convenient unto the Patient, and ſuch as may bring the leaſt pain unto him; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſtil, that the Member hang not down, leſt that there ſhould be an occaſion for an afflux of the Humors. But the wound is to be Cured like as other Wounds; but yet nevertheleſs it is not to be bound up in the ſame manner as other wounds are. And great care muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be taken that it be not offended by the external cold of the Air. Cataplaſms are likewiſe to be impoſed, not upon the Wound it ſelf, But upon the parts that lie neer unto it, leſt that by any means the part ſhould by the weight thereof be grieved and burthened. And in regard that fluxions are eaſily cauſed (in this caſe) unto theſe parts, and thereupon the Cure the longer ere it be perfected; therefore the Body is by often purgations, and likewiſe by ſwears, to be purged and cleanſed from all its vitious and ſuperfluous Humors.</p>

                  <p>UNto Wounds with a Contuſion there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long likewiſe even thoſe that are cauſed by the biting of Living Creatures, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets ſhot from Guns; touching which our purpoſe is therefore to treat in ſpecial, and particularly. And in the firſt place, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Wounds that are made by the biting of Living Creatures, we intend to treat of them here in this Chapt. as they are void of Poyſon: and of the biting of Poyſonous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures our purpoſe is to ſpeak afterward, in the 21. Chapter. For it ſomtimes ſo happeneth that a man may be bitten by a Dog, Ape, Horſe, Aſs, or other Creatures that are not poyſonous or mad; or elſe one man may be bitten by another. But <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> (in his 5. <hi>B.</hi> and 27. <hi>Chap.</hi>) writeth, that all bitings whatſoever of wilde Beaſts have in them a certain kinde of Poyſon: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cannot well be denyed of wilde Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For ſince that the very ſpittle of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creatures hath in it a great power and virtue, (in ſo much that if there be any thing vitious in the Body it eaſily drinketh it up)
<pb n="2690" facs="tcp:49110:187"/> this ſpittle may together with the biting eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be conveyed into the Wound. And this muſt likewiſe be remembred, that theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls when they bite, they are for the moſt part enraged. And then it being true, (as it is generally wel known) that wrath and rage have in them a great power both of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a commotion in the humors, as alſo of corrupting them; that vitiouſneſs of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors is very eaſily communicated unto the ſpittle, and by it may as eaſily be imparted unto the Wound: and this happeneth much the rather, if ſo be the Man be Frantick. And if there were altogether nothing of virulency in the Wound that is inflicted by the biting of one of theſe living creatures; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the very contuſion it ſelf (which rendereth all wounds whatſoever the more dangerous, and the more difficult to be cured maketh thoſe wounds the more grievous. For ſince that the teeth of the ſaid Animals are not ſo ſharp as a ſword, or ſome other kind of Weapon; while they wound, they do withal likewiſe bruiſe, and cauſe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the part they faſten upon.</p>

                     <p>But now how dangerous theſe wounds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may be that are cauſed by one mans bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another, <hi>Guihelm. Fabricius</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us by three Examples, and inſtances, that he giveth thus in his 2 <hi>Century, Obſervat.</hi> 84. and 85. The firſt whereof is of a certain Merchant who a midſt his Cups by anothers biting was wounded in the very tip of the right forefinger; whoſe whole right hand u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſame biting became inflamed, and a <hi>Gangrene</hi> ſoon after began to follow, with Convulſions, an extreme burning feaver, a Syncope, and continual reſtleſneſs.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond inſtance is of a Phyſitian, who raſhly and inconſideratly putting his finger into the mouth of a Phrantick woman, to the end he might feel her tongue, had it bitten by this mad woman; and upon this biting he became extremly afflicted with a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pain, not only in the ſaid finger, but in the whol Arm alſo. The laſt example is of a man that being by another furious and enraged perſon ſorely bitten even unto the firſt Articulation of his Thumb, he likewiſe was in ſtantly taken with a vehement pain al that Arm throughout, and ſoon after there followed a feaver, and a Syncope.</p>
                     <p>

Obſerv.</hi> 49.) relateth the like Hiſtory of a certain perſon, who by another mans teeth (the man being much enraged) was wounded in his thumb, about the firſt Joynt; from whence there aroſe a moſt extreme pain, an Inflammation of the whol hand, a Continual fever, a reſtleſneſs of the body, frequent faintings and ſwound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and a very intenſe pain of the head.</p>
                     <p>And evermore the wounds are dangerous, both in themſelves, (by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion) as alſo becauſe that the ſpittle of the furious and enraged Animals hath ſomwhat of malignity Joyned with it; and they are ſo much the more dangerous, if any of the Nervous parts (ſuch as are the fingers) ſhal chance to be bitten.</p>

                     <p>In regard that (as we have ſaid) in every wound that is inflicted by the biting of any living Creature there is preſent a Contuſion, and this ſomtimes greater, and ſomtimes leſs according as the teeth of thoſe Creatures are more ſharp (ſuch as are the teeth of a Dog, Ape, and Squirrel) or elſe leſs ſharp, (as thoſe of a Man, Horſe, Aſs &amp;c.) and that from this Contuſion the pain is cauſed; therefore there ought a regard to be had both unto the Contuſion and the pain.</p>
                     <p>And therefore in the firſt place, the blood is carefully to be preſſed and ſqueezed forth of the wound; and opening of a vein, or purgation (according as need ſhal require) is to be inſtituted: and to prevent the greater afflux of the humors, and the Malady from being communicated unto the ſuperiour parts ſome Defenſive of Oxycrate, or ſome o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Take <hi>One Egge, butter half an ounce, Saffron one ſcruple, Oyl of Violets, and Roſes of each two drams; and mingle them.</hi> or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Marſhmallow Roots, one ounce and half; the leaves of Mallows, flowers of Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, and Melilote, of each half a handful; Wormwood two pugils; boyl them to a ſoftneſs and let them be wel bruiſed and maſhed together: when they are wel bruiſed add unto them the yelk of one Egge, oyl of Roſes, and Camomil, of each as much wil ſuffice, and make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If there be any fear that there is ſome kind of virulency in the Wound, then we may ad <hi>Scordium,</hi> as alſo <hi>Treacle;</hi> and therefore ſuch an unguent is to be provided.</p>

                     <p>And moreover, that what is bruiſed may be wholly converted into <hi>Pus</hi> we are to uſe <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of Roſes, Roſin Turpentine, with the yelk of

                     </p>
                     <p>And at length, the Wound being wel wiped and cleanſed, it is to be filled up with fleſh, and ſo ſhut up with a cicatrice, as in other caſes is wont to be done.</p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Gangrene</hi> be feared, as nigh at hand, then the Cure is ſo to be ordered, as we ſayd before, touching the <hi>Gangrene.</hi>

                     <p>The pain yet for all this little or nothing remitting, about the hand wriſt, and the Elbow, he applyed this Defenſive.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent of Roſes Champhorated (or with Camphyre and the Santaline Oyl, or the oyl of Saunders, of each half an ounce; oyl of Roſes with the Juice of Night-ſhade, three drams; Bole Armenick two drams, powder of red Roſes one dram; Roſe vinegar as much as wil ſuffice, and mingle them.</hi>

                     <head>Whether wounds that are inflicted by Gunſhot have any Malignity in them; and whether they receive any burning heat, (cauſing an Inflammation, and putrefaction of the humors) from the powder, or the Bullet?</head>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Three opinions touching wounds by Gun-ſhot.</note>And here in this Controverſy, we find that Authors are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divided into three Ranks, and opinions. The firſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that the Wounds inflicted by bullets from Guns are poyſonous. Others deny indeed that they have any thing of poyſon in them; yet they have nevertheleſs (as they ſay) an <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> and burning. But thirdly, and laſtly, others there are that wil not admit of either of theſe; but they aſſert, that al that wherein theſe Wounds differ from thoſe that are inflicted by a ſharp weapon, is from the contuſion and tearing of thoſe parts the bullet paſſeth thorow. All which opinions we wil now examine in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The firſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>And firſt of al, the opinion of them that aſſert theſe wounds to be poyſonous is indeed very Ancient; and therefore ſoon after the invention of Guns, according to this opinion, there was likewiſe a Method
<pb n="2692" facs="tcp:49110:188"/> propounded and practiſed, for the curing of Wounds inflicted by Gunſhot. For <hi>John de vigo</hi> (in the ſecond part of his <hi>Pract. Chirurg.</hi> Book 1. and the <hi>Chapter of a poyſonous wound</hi>) writeth in this manner: If the Wound ſhal be cauſed by the Inſtrument how much uſed, and called <hi>la Bombarda,</hi> or (as we term it) the Gun; then there ought to be made a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terization, with the oyl of <hi>Elder,</hi> or the oyl of <hi>Linſeed</hi> only. And <hi>Paraeus</hi> writeth (in his tenth Book of <hi>Chirurgery, Apologiſm.</hi> 1.) that it was a thing much in uſe even in his time, to burn into ſuch wounds with the oyl of Elder applyed very hot, and that had min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with it a little Treacle; and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo at the firſt followed this way and method of curing; until accidentally (by a certain chance) there was another way taught; touching which, ſee the place allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe that follow this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion prove this poyſonouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (in the general) from the diſeaſes and ſymptoms that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually happen there upon;<note place="margin">The reaſons by which the firſt opinion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> ſuch as are, the corruption of the parts, and the Gangrene, thoſe ulcers reſembling the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Tumor <hi>Herpes,</hi> the trembling of the Heart, Malignant fevers, the lips of the Wound leaden coloured, or black; and then next of al they prove it from the courſe that is taken in the Cure; becauſe that it is found by experience, that <hi>Alexipharmaca</hi> (or Counter poyſons) have brought much benefit and help unto the Patient; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that theſe Wounds are to be kept open a long time, after the manner of other poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Wounds. And laſtly, ſome there are that pretend this likewiſe, that it hath been found, that all thoſe have periſhed that in ſome certain battles have been wounded by ſuch bullets; or if any have eſcaped, that it was very hardly; and that they were preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſome extraordinary pains and labour; although that the Wounds did not ſeem ſo great and dangerous, whatever were the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and care of the Chirurgeons, and though it were never ſo little.</p>
                     <p>But others of this opinion wil have this poyſonouſneſs to proceed from the Gunpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the force and violence whereof the bullets are driven forth; others from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and metal of which the bullets are made; others from the poyſon wherewith theſe bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets are poyſoned. For this powder conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Brimſtone, Nitre, and Coals: of which (they ſay) the two former are hot in themſelves; and when they are fired, they then become extremely hot; and if they take flame, then do they at length acquire a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous quality, as theſe would perſwade us. And this they think to be ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt even by this alſo, becauſe that thoſe who make this powder ſhut both their mouth and their Noſethrills, that ſo they may not be hurt by the poyſonous exhalations of this powder. But they who derive this poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs from the Metal, theſe tell us that al Metals in general are poyſonous, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto our bodies: others although they ſay not that theſe bullets are in themſelves poyſonous; yet nevertheleſs they take upon them to prove that theſe bullets may be po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; and that this was much uſed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Nations, they abundantly prove out of ſeveral Authors; As, <hi>The ophraſtus,</hi> in his <hi>ninth Book of Plants; Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> in his <hi>ſixth Book, and Chapt.</hi> 20. <hi>Pliny,</hi> in his <hi>twelfth Book, and Chapt.</hi> 53. <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his <hi>ſixth Book and Chapt.</hi> 88. and other modern Writers. And ſome there are who here (for to prove this their opinion) be take themſelves to the likeneſs and reſembl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the lightening and blow of the Gun; and as it is moſt certain that oftentimes in Lightening there is a certain poyſonous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power (as is ſufficiently teſtifyed by the ſtench, and the wonderful power it hath of blaſting and deſtroying both man and beaſt, and that in a moment; as alſo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther malignant Effects thereof ſufficiently witneſs the truth hereof) ſo they conceive that there is ſomething like unto it in the flaſh of the powder and the noyſe or report of the Gun.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Many there have been,<note place="margin">The Second o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</note> and ſtil are, who affirm that an Empyreuma or Combuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts is joyned with theſe Wounds. And hereupon it is, that Chirurgeons commonly carry about with them ſo many Medicaments, which our Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons term <hi>Pulver le ſhung,</hi> (that is, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhers of the Gunpouder, or the <hi>Empyrema</hi> when the parts are inflamed and burnt in theſe wounds by Gunſhot) becauſe, to wit, that they are perſwaded, that in ſuch wounds there is an <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> which is firſt of all to be extinguiſhed. And this they endeavor to prove by theſe Reaſons. Firſt of al,<note place="margin">The Reaſons for proofe of the ſecond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> becauſe thoſe bullets when they are caſt forth may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by the Gunpouder, and ſo may contract an <hi>Empyreuma.</hi> Secondly, from the motion it ſelf of the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, which in regard that it is moſt quick and ſwift, they conclude that the bullet is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made hot; the ſame that even <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo hath taught us; who (in his ſecond Book <hi>de Caelo Chapt.</hi> 7. <hi>text</hi> 42. and in his firſt Book of <hi>Meteors, text,</hi> 3.) writeth, that by a vehement motion the Iron is made
<pb n="2693" facs="tcp:49110:188"/> hot, and the Arrow heads melted, and wood and ſtones ſet on fire: which we are likewiſe taught by Experience it ſelf, it being very wel known, that by the hard and vehement rubbing of wood one piece againſt another the Country people do ſometimes raiſe a fire; and that the Axletrees of Mil-wheels, unleſs they be often moyſtened with fat, are very apt to be inflamed and ſet on fire. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo, the very ſame is by experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in theſe bullets; ſince that oftentimes it hath been found, that (in villages) the ſtraw or thatched houſes have by theſe bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets been ſet on fire; and that whole houſes have been burnt down thereby. Fourthly, they ſay alſo that other things that are wont to happen in combuſtions or burnings, do appear likewiſe in thoſe Wounds; to wit, that the wound it ſelf becometh black, that there flow forth from thence ſharp, ſtinking and black I chores (or thin Excrements) and that the inflammation (as it is wont to be in all combuſtions or burnings) is augmented even untill the Ninth day, and then after this diminiſhed.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Reaſons for the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> And thirdly, thoſe that deny that there is preſent in theſe Wounds any poyſon or burning they urge theſe Reaſons for their opinion.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> That there doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any poyſon from the Gun-pouder.</note> And indeed in the firſt place, they in this manner fight,and oppoſe themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this poyſoning of the Wounds. Firſt of al (ſay they) if there be any poyſon in ſuch Wounds as are inflicted by gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, it is brought in and cauſed either from the Gun-pouder, or elſe from the bullet. That it proceedeth not from the Gun-powder, appeareth from hence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thoſe things of which it is compounded are not poyſonous: for it is made of Brimſtone, Nitre and Coals: of all which not one of them is poyſonous. For both the Sulphur, and the Nitre, are made uſe of in the ſtead of internal Medicaments, both by the Ancient, and by the Modern Phyſitians alſo; and this is a thing ſo generally wel known, that it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not any proof at all. And much leſs have theſe Coals any thing of poyſon in them. And although that this powder ſhal be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet notwithſtanding it cannot from thence acquire any poyſonouſneſs, ſince that fire doth rather conſume then produce vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſity or poyſonouſneſs. And that this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is not poyſonous, there are many Soldiers that have ſufficiently proved; who have made great uſe of it (together with vinegar) for the Curing of the Plague: and they uſe to burn it in houſes, in time of a great plague to drive it away, and to preſerve themſelves from the contagion thereof. Yea, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it ſelf, and experience do ſufficiently prove this, which teſtify, that very many who have been wounded by theſe bullets have yet notwithſtanding ſuffered no ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom at all, that in the leaſt might betoken any thing of poyſon.</p>
                     <p>Neither alſo can this poyſon come from the leaden bullet.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Not from the Bullet.</note> For it is moſt manifeſt, that the bullet of lead (eſpecially if it be whole) cannot poſſibly bring any poyſon along with it; and it appeareth even from this, that many carry about in their bodies ſuch bullets that have been ſhot into them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the ſpace of many years, and this without any hurt or damage at al. Yea ſome have ſwallowed bullets of lead, and caſt them forth again by the belly, without any the leaſt hurt. And it is a thing very wel known, that Lead, and ſuch various Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as have from it been made, have been by the Ancients and our ſelves very ſucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adminiſtred unto the External parts, for the curing of old Ulcers. But now that ſuch bullets may indeed be poyſoned (as we ſhall afterwards ſhew you) this they deny not: but this happeneth not unto al ſuch wounds; as we ſhall anon further ſhew you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">That there is preſent no burning, how proved.</note>And that there is alſo no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning preſent in the Wound they thus prove it. For firſt of all if theſe Wounds ſhould bring in any burning at all, then the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets themſelves ought to be fired; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon melted; whereas notwithſtanding, we ſee that the bullets are taken whol out of Wounds, and appear to have ſuffered no ſuch thing, Secondly, this burning ſhould rather be perceived in thoſe things that are more combuſtible; and this burning ſhould firſt of all appear eſpecially in the Clothes of thoſe that are in this manner wounded: whereas notwithſtanding, there is not the leaſt appearance or ſhew of any burning in theſe Garments, whether Linen or Woollen: yea and thoſe who endeavor to defend ſhips and houſes from the violence and blows of theſe bullets, what do they? Do they not hang before them Sacks filled ful of Wooll or hurds? Which were yet never known to be ſet on fire by theſe bullets, no not by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of them. Neither may any one here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſay that there is great difference between the parts of mans body, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch like things. For ſuch things as theſe (by reaſon of the widneſs of their paſſages,) may be pierced thorow by this moſt thin Exhalation, without touching or hurting the ſubſtance: which yet may hurt
<pb n="2694" facs="tcp:49110:189"/> a mans Body, by reaſon of the cloſeneſs and compactedneſs thereof: and that the ſame happeneth here which is wont in the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening that oftentimes melteth the Sword, without hurting the Scabbard.</p>
                     <p>But there is here a very vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lightening and a Bullet. For the whole Action of the Lightening is by a moſt powerful Spirit; and by a moſt ſubtile ſubſtance that pierceth through all things whatſoever: but it is not yet proved, that there is Joyned with the Leaden Bullet any ſuch ſpirit; but here the whole Action is of the Bullet it ſelf, which neither burneth things that are thin and permeable, nor yet Wood, (and other things of a thick ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) upon which it not only glanceth but directly ſtriketh againſt. Thirdly, ſince that there is hardly any thing to be named that is more inflamable then the Gun-pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; if theſe bullets ſhould burn the Body of Man, it ſhould much more kindle and ſet on Fire the Gun-pouder; which yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it doth not do; experience it ſelf teſtifying, and teaching us, that although a Veſſel that is ful of ſuch Gun-pouder ſhall be ſhot through by ſuch a bullet, yet that the ſaid Gun-pouder is not hereby kindled and ſet on Fire. But if at any time it ſo chance that by a Bullet ſent out of a Gun the Gun-pouder be fired, this happeneth becauſe that either the flame it ſelf penetrateth unto the Pouder; or elſe that the Bullet ſtriking againſt Iron, or ſome Stone, is kindled by the ſparks of Fire, juſt as we ſee it to be in the ſtriking together of the Steel and the Flint-ſtone. Fourthly, if inſtead of the Leaden bullet, either Papper pellets or pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of Hurds be ram'd into the Gun, and then ſhot forth, there will not appear any the leaſt tokens of any burning in them (cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either by the Gun-pouder, or elſe from the vehemency of motion;) but only, that ſomtimes they are ſullied by the Gun-pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and made a little black; and they are oftentimes drawn forth of the very Wounds as whole and entire as they went in. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Thoſe who are thus wounded do not feel any heat or burning from theſe bullets, but only a pain from the bruiſing and tearing of the fleſh. Sixthly, That thoſe bullets are not made hot either by the flame of the Gun-pouder, or elſe by the ſwiftneſs of their motion, we are ſufficiently aſſured of it even by this, that a bullet made of Wax, and ſhot forth of a Gun, doth not at all melt, but that it even pierceth through a two inch board, or any piece of Wood two Fingers thick. And from this alone it may appear very manifeſt-that thoſe bullets, whatſoever it be that they do, it is not by the power and virtue of any Fire that they have in them; but what they effect, is meerly by their force, and violence.</p>
                     <p>But now that I may a little open unto you my thoughts,<note place="margin">The Deciſion of al the opinions.</note> and give my Judgment touching this Controverſie; I conceive the third Opinion (well weighing the Reaſons that are brought for it) to be the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to truth. But thoſe Arguments that are brought for the two former Opinions may eaſily be anſwered. For the firſt of the three, who defend, that thoſe Wounds are poyſonous, they do not prove it by this, that firſt of all grievous and dangerous Symptoms do infeſt thoſe that are wounded in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For all thoſe Symptoms may poſſibly proceed from a Contuſion if it be not rightly Cured, or if it be overgreat, and that there be from hence a putridneſs excited. For when that bullet doth with the greateſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that may be penetrate through thoſe parts againſt which it hitteth, it daſhet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all whatſoever lieth in its way, briuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and teareth it; by which ſaid violence not only the Capillary Veins, and the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Nerves, (that be every where up and down diſperſed throughout the fleſh) are rent and torn; but the greater Veſſels like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are battered and broken; inſomuch that the Natural flux of the Blood and the Spirits is hereby hindered; whereupon the bruiſed parts being deprived of their Natural and Vital heat are eaſily corrupted, and ſoon putrifie. Neither can it truly be ſaid, that the trembling of the Heart, and the like Symptoms do happen unto all that are thus wounded, But as for what they ſay in the ſecond place, that <hi>Alexipharmaca</hi> (or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-poyſons) have been ſomtimes found very good and commodious for the perſon thus wounded; we anſwer, that this is not true of all Wounds made by Gun-ſhot; but of thoſe only, when by the Contuſion, and the great putridneſs following thereupon, and the neer approaching of a Gangrene, the Heart is hurt by the putrid Vapors, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Wound through the Arteries; and thereupon it is by Alexipharmick and Cordial Medicaments to be defended from them, and withal ſtrengthened. But, that thoſe Wounds are a long time to be kept open, this is not therefore to be done, that ſo the poyſon may be evacuated; but that the <hi>Pus</hi> that is continually generated from the bruiſed parts may be emptied forth, which is done too ſlowly, in regard that in ſuch Wounds as theſe there is very much of that that is bruiſed. And Laſtly, for what they alleadg, that in many battles the moſt of thoſe that have been wounded, either they have Died, or elſe they have been preſerved with very great pains and much difficulty;
<pb n="2695" facs="tcp:49110:189"/> this did not therefore happen, becauſe that the Wounds inflicted by Gun-ſhot were poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous; (ſince that in very many other bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles no ſuch thing hath been obſerved,) but it happened from hence, to wit, either by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the bad and unhealthful Conſtitution of the Air; or elſe from the vitious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Conſtitution of the Body, and the great ſtore of depraved Humors in theſe wounded perſons; ſuch as is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wont to be in thoſe that follow the Camp.</p>
                     <p>But now in ſpecial, and particularly, the poyſonouſneſs of thoſe Wounds cannot be proved to ariſe either from the Gun-pouder, or from the bullet. For (as we alſo told you before) neither is the Sulphur, nor the Nitre, nor yet the Coals, all or any one of them poyſonous; and therefore ſurely of theſe there can nothing be compounded that is poyſonous. And that Sulphur and Nitre may be ſafely adminiſtred, appeareth out of <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> his 5. <hi>B.</hi> and 83. <hi>Ch.</hi> and out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his <hi>B. of the Nature of Women;</hi> and others, both Ancient and Modern. Now the kindling and inflaming of theſe, and the Fire following thereupon, would rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate this poyſon (if any ſuch were preſent) then any waies produce it. Neither do thoſe that make this pouder ſtop their Mouths and Noſethrils, by reaſon of any poyſonous quality that it hath, but to keep out the pouder, that is otherwiſe very troubleſom when it gets into the Mouth of Noſethrils: neither yet do all that make pouder ſtop the aforeſaid places, although ſome do for the reaſon I have given you.</p>
                     <p>And moreover, much leſs can this poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs be produced from the Lead. For although it being long deteined in the Body, and there reſolved, like unto other Metals, (if it contract any ruſtineſs) it may poſſibly do hurt: but yet nevertheleſs, that in this its moment any paſſage through the Body there ſhould be any poyſon imprinted by it upon the Body, this can no way be. And (as we told you above) theſe bullets have ſomtimes been known to lie in the Body for many yeers together, without any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience or hurt: yea and moreover, from lead there are many very uſeful Medicaments to be made, for External Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>But this we eaſily (and of our own accord) yield un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o, and readily grant them; that thoſe Bullets, as alſo all other Weapons, may be infected with poyſon. For although the Lead be thick enough, yet nevertheleſs, ſince that Iron that is yet far more ſolid may be infected with Poyſon, why may not Lead alſo be poyſoned? Now that Iron may be infected with poyſon, there is no doubt at all to be made; the truth whereof is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtifyed by the Hiſtories (both Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Modern) of thoſe Nations that as yet uſe Arrows. And this we are aſſured of by <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> (in his <hi>ſixth Book,</hi> and 21. <hi>Chapt.</hi>) and by <hi>Paulus Aegineta,</hi> (in his <hi>ſixth B.</hi> and 88. <hi>Chap.</hi>) and by <hi>Virgil,</hi> (in the <hi>tenth B.</hi> of his Aeneids, and elſewhere) as alſo by <hi>Ovid</hi> in his 3. <hi>B. de Triſtibus.</hi> And of this there is no queſtion at all to be made. But here lieth the queſtion, whether or no every Wound inflicted by the bullet out of a Gun be poyſoned; and this I deny. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, like as we cannot truly conclude, that becauſe that Wound which is inflicted by a poyſoned Sword poyſoned, therefore that all Wounds inflicted by the Sword are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: ſo alſo we can no more rightly and truly conclude thus, if there be ſome cerrain Wounds made by Gun ſhot, that are poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, therefore they are all ſuch. Neither is there any reaſon, why any one (with <hi>Paraeus</hi> in his 10. <hi>B. Apologiſm</hi> 2.) ſhould think, that there is m Fire power enough (and more then enough) to diſſipate all the ſtrength of the poyſon, if any ſhould chance to be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the bullet. For (as we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prove) and as even <hi>Paraeus</hi> himſelf granteth, thoſe bullets out of Guns can by no means get any ſuch great heat, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (like as by Fire) the poyſon (if any ſuch there be preſent) may be diſſipated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
                     <p>But now, in what manner theſe bullets may be infected, whether only by being anoynted, (as <hi>Paraeus</hi> is of opinion) or elſe by an infuſion of the very poyſoned ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it ſelf (which he denieth) of this I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not. And yet nevertheleſs, I do not think it a thing altogether impoſſible, that ſome poyſoned ſubſtance (if not vegetable, yet Mineral) may be given, which by infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be mingled together with the Lead, and there remain. But I ſhall not contend at all in the maintaining of this my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, neither ſhall I take much pains to diſcover whether there be any ſuch, yea, or no.</p>
                     <p>And whereas they would by the inſtance they give of the Lightening prove their opinion; we anſwer that there is not ſo great a reſemblance between the Lightening and the Report or blow of a Gun, as they think. For indeed that there is oftentimes in Lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a certain kinde of poyſonouſneſs, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied. But in the blow or Noiſe of a Gun there is no ſuch thing, as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore already proved out of its Compoſition. Neither doth any flame from the kindled pouder penetrate unto the Wound it ſelf; but whatſoever the bullet doth it performeth
<pb n="2696" facs="tcp:49110:190"/> by its violence and motion, after the manner of other things that are caſt forth with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as Arrows, and Stones caſt forth of ſlings. But now, for what reaſon things thus caſt forth by a violent and vehement motion ſhould work ſuch effects, here is no fit place for me to diſpute. And if there be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance at all between the Lightening and Guns, this likeneſs is rather in the Fire from the Gun-pouder being kindled and caſt forth, then in the Leaden bullets.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, Their telling of us that in ſome certain battles ſuch as have been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by theſe kind of Bullets they have moſt of them died of their Wounds, neither doth this prove the poyſonouſneſs of theſe Wounds. For neither doth this happen in all battles, (as we likewiſe told you before) but very many have been Cured and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the moſt dangerous and deſperate Wounds. And this if it ſhall ſomtimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, it is to be aſcribed either unto the Malice of the enemy, infecting theſe bullets with poyſon, or elſe to the ill diſpoſition of the wounded bodies, or laſtly, even unto the vitious Air it ſelf. For it is a thing well known, that the Bodies of Souldiers (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that ill courſe of Dyet they keep) are very much diſpoſed unto the Plague, and other Diſeaſes: in whom Wounds, if any happen unto them, may eaſily prove Mortal; like as the Wounds of Hydropick and other Cacochymical perſons are wont to be very dangerous. And there is likewiſe no doubt to be made, but that the Air becoming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and corrupt, both by the unſeſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the weather, the Crazy Conſtitution of the yeer, and the impurities, and naſtineſs that alwaies followeth the Camp, may cauſe the wounds to be the more dangerous. And evermore in ſuch like Wounds the ill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bodies, and the Vitious Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Air, bring more danger unto the party, then in other Wounds inflicted and made without any bullet. For in theſe latter there is no ſuch great need of ſuppuration; but in thoſe other Wounds that are not made without much bruiſing, there is altogether great need of Suppuration, and Suppurating Medicaments. Neither without theſe can ſuch Wounds by bruiſing be any waies Cured; which ſaid wounds in Bodies that are ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed do very eaſily get a putridneſs; which the feavers that follow, and the bad Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are eaſily able to excite. Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is this any new kind of wound. For although that the invention of Guns, and this caſting forth of the Leaden bullets be new; yet the manner of the wound is not at all new, (as being wel known both unto <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi>) to wt, Contuſion, or bruiſing. And yet nevertheleſs our expert Chirurgeons do not it reſt themſelves in the alone uſe of Suppuratives, but if there be any fear of a putridneſs nigh at hand, which may very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily produce a Gangrene, they then uſe the <hi>Aegyptiack <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent,</hi> and other Medicaments that may prevent and keep off the Gangrene; as we ſhall anon have occaſion to ſpeak fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereof, when we come to ſhew you the Cure; which yet notwithſtanding ought ſo to be ordered and contrived, that they may not altogether hinder the ſuppuration; ſince that no wound made with Contuſion or brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing can poſſibly be healed, unleſs that which is bruiſed be converted into <hi>Pus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as for that other Opinion of thoſe who aſſert that there is a burning or <hi>Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuma</hi> conjoyned with theſe wounds, neither have theſe any firm Reaſons to ground their opinion upon. For that our German Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Chirurgeons call theſe their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that are in theſe wounds at the very firſt adminiſtred, <hi>Pulver le ſchung,</hi> that is, Extinguiſhers of the <hi>Empyreuma</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> burning that happeneth from the Gun-pouder; this is grounded upon a falſe ſuppoſition; for they who at firſt gave this appellation unto theſe Medicaments did falſely beleeve, that there was an <hi>Empyreuma</hi> joyned with theſe wounds, and that this <hi>Empyreuma</hi> or burning was firſt of all to be extinguiſhed. But now all thoſe Medicaments perform nothing elſe, but that they either turn into <hi>Pus</hi> all that in the wound that is bruiſed, and ſo hinder and prevent putridneſs; or elſe they keep off, and turn away the inflammation, if there be any nigh at hand. Now that theſe ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Medicaments differ ſomwhat from thoſe ſuppurations that are wont to be adminiſtred in other Wounds and Ulcers, there is no wonder in this: For above, (in the <hi>firſt Part,</hi> and 16. <hi>Chapt.</hi> and likewiſe a little before, in the 18 <hi>Chap.</hi> of this <hi>fourth Part, touching a Wound with Contuſion</hi>) we told you that in Contuſions thoſe hot and moiſt ſuppuratives have no place at all, but that from the uſe of them a putridneſs and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo a Gangrene is thereupon excited; and that therefore thoſe Medicaments that were more drying, and ſuch as reſiſt putrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (provided, that in the mean time they likewiſe ſtrengthen Nature in her generating of <hi>Pus</hi>) are neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>But now the Reaſons they alleadg for this their Opinion have in them very little of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity. For firſt, whereas they aſſert that thoſe bullets are as it were fired by the Gun-pouder when it is kindled, this is falſe; and above by thoſe Arguments we brought for the third Opinion, it was ſufficiently proved,
<pb n="2697" facs="tcp:49110:190"/> that thoſe bullets are no waies heated and ſet on Fire by the ſaid Gun-pouder. And then furthermore, whereas they think that thoſe bullets are made hot by their violent and ſwift motion, (and to prove this, they Cite <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as a witneſs on their ſide; for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> indeed, in the <hi>place before alleadged,</hi> writeth, that motion is wont to ſet on Fire both Wood and Stones, and even Iron it ſelf; and this he confirmeth by experience;) unto this we thus reply; that this may be done, there is a neceſſity that there be two hard and ſolid bodies long rubbed hard one againſt the other. But that Lead, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metal, ſhould by their motion through the Air become very hot, and that it ſhould hereby be ſet on Fire, this was never yet taught us by experience. For if this were done, then Arrows alſo (that oftentimes are pointed with Iron or Braſs points, we call them Arrow Heads) being ſhot through the Air ought to become hot, and likewiſe to be fired. But now, as for what they ſay in the third place, to wit, that by theſe bullets thatched Cottages and other Houſes have been ſet on Fire; this we grant to be true, if any flame (which together with the bullet is ſent forth of the Gun) touch the Houſe; or if there be any kinde of Fewel, or Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible matter fit to feed the Fire, tied and faſtened unto the bullet, as Incendiaries are wont to do. But if it be from that flame, or from fiery matter: and if the bullet only touch the ſtraw neither it, as neither Wooll, nor Hurds, nor Gun-pouder it ſelf can be kindled; as before we told you in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were brought for the third Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                     <p>Neither is there any place here for that diſtiction of <hi>Quercetan,</hi> (which he hath in his <hi>Sclopetarius</hi> or Gunner) where he writeth that if that bullet be ſent forth of the Gun at a diſtance, and a great way off, or elſe that it hit any part that is covered with Clothes, that then the Wound is without an Empyreu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma or burning: but if the Wound be inflicted by ſuch a bullet out of a Gun nigh at hand, or if it light upon a part of the Body that is naked and bare, that then the Wound may have Joyned with it a heat and burning. For although that the flame from the kindled Gun-pouder, breaking forth of the Gun, may neer at hand hurt the beard, and the Hairs of the Head, or likewiſe the Clothes; yet notwithſtanding it is altogether a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that the flame by that ſmal Wound of the Skin (through which the bullet pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trateth into the Body) ſhould together with the bullet break in, and pierce ſo far into the Body. Neither doth there appear any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Wounds made by bullets, whether a far off, or night at hand, but only this, that the Contuſion is greater and more grievous that is cauſed by a bullet ſhot forth nigh at hand (in regard that it ſtrikes with a greater violence) then the Contuſion or bruiſe that cometh from that bullet that is ſhot at a great diſtance, and ſtriketh more weakly. But Fourthly, As for what concerneth the Symptoms that appear in theſe Wounds; we anſwer, that all theſe do not proceed from any <hi>Empyreuma</hi> or burning, but from the Contuſion; and they appear alſo in thoſe other Wounds in which there is preſent no <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> nor burning, at all. And that at length about the ninth day the wound ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be in a better condition, and what is corrupted begins to be ſeparated; this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth not only in Wounds with burnings, and where there is an Eſchar; but alſo in Contuſions; ſince that a certain ſpace of time there ought to be, wherein that which is bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and bruiſed and corrupted be turned and converted into <hi>Pus.</hi> Neither is that to be accounted for any true Eſchar, that theſe men take for an Eſchar in theſe kinds of Wounds; being that it is no waies hard, as an Eſchar is; but fleſh greatly bruiſed, which forthwith dieth; whereupon it likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh black; and yet nevertheleſs, it is ſomtimes likewiſe diſcoloured, and made black by the heat of that Gun-pouder with which the bullet it foul'd and ſullied.</p>
                     <p>By al which it may ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear,<note place="margin">The Nature of Wounds inflicted by Gun-ſhot.</note> what the Nature of theſe Wounds is; to wit, that it is only with ſome notable Contuſion and tearing of thoſe parts through which the bullet paſſeth. And although the part may cloſe at Hand, and at a neer diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, be burnt by the flame of the inflamed Gun-pouder, yet this appertaineth not unto the Wound it ſelf; neither is the part burnt within. And we likewiſe grant that theſe bullets may poſſibly be infected by poyſon; but this is no way eſſential unto theſe wounds but a thing meerly accidental: like as, if any one ſhal be wounded by a poyſoned Sword, this poyſoning is no way of the eſſence of the Wound.</p>
                     <p>But that which hath deceived all thoſe of this Opinion, is this, that other Symptoms happen unto theſe wounds, and that theſe wounds require another kind of Cure then thoſe Wounds that are cauſed by Arrows. But theſe ought better to have conſidered, that there is a very great difference between thoſe wounds. For Arrows are ſharp, and they make a wound by Cutting; but thoſe bullets are round and blunt, and therefore they hurt by breaking and bruiſing; upon which there eaſily follow a Corruption
<pb n="2698" facs="tcp:49110:191"/> of the bruiſed part, and very ill Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</p>

                        <p>The Differences of theſe Wounds are taken. 1. From the greatneſs of the Wound; to wit, that ſome are great, ſome but ſmal, ſome ſuperficial, others more deep. 2. From the part affected; that ſomtimes only the Fleſh and the Skin are wounded, but ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Nerves and Tendons, Yea and the greater Veſſels are broken, Yea and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bones likewiſe are broken and ſhattered. 3. Another Difference is from the manner, that a Man is ſomtimes wounded only in one part; and ſomtimes the whole Body, or ſome one part thereof is wholly ſhot through: and ſomtimes alſo the bullet paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth quite through the part, and then at other times it ſticketh yet ſtil in the part: and ſomtimes only the bullet penetrateth into the Body; but ſomtimes again it carrieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it into the Body ſome of the weapon, or ſome thing elſe through which it paſſeth.</p>

                        <p>There is no need that I declare unto you thoſe ſigns by which theſe wounds in general are known; ſeeing it will be ſufficient to know that the party was wounded with a bullet ſhot forth of a Gun. But now what parts they are that are Wounded, this is to be diſcovered either by putting in the Probe; or elſe it may be known from the very Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the parts, with the which Anatomy will acquaint us. If the Nervous parts chance to be hurt, this the pain will manifeſt. But whether or no the wound be poyſoned, this is known by the Symptoms following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; to wit, if the colour of the fleſh be more Wan and Leaden-coloured then it was wont to be; if there likewiſe happen an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary heavineſs and ſluggiſhneſs of the whole Body; if there be a trembling and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation of the heart, Faintings and Swoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and other ſuch like Symptoms as theſe, and that there be no other Cauſe appearing from which ſuch Symptoms might proceed. Which notwithſtanding even the very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the bullet (if it be there preſent) wil ſufficiently teach us. For if the bullet differ from all the other things in colour, or in any thing elſe, there is then great cauſe to ſuſpect its being infected with poyſon: and this is confirmed, if the bullet being put into a hot fire, we take good notice whether or no there exhale from it any thing that is black and ſtinking, or elſe whether the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let it ſelf being again cooled, there ſtick any thing unto the outſide of it, and change its colour</p>
                        <p>It is known that ſuch a Wound as this will degenerate and turn into a Gangrene, by the ſlow Maturation and generating of the <hi>Pus;</hi> by the extinguiſhment of the freſh and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing colour of the part, and its inclining unto a yellow, and Leaden colour; by the remitting of the pain without any apparent cauſe, and by the ceaſing of the beating, and by the ſtupidity of the part, and by other like ſigns of the Gangrene, ſuch as we have above ſhewn unto you, in the <hi>ſecond Part,</hi> and 19. <hi>Chapter.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. All thoſe Wounds, ſince that they have Joyned with them an extraordinary and notable Contuſion, they are therefore far more dangerous then thoſe Wounds that are inflicted with a Sword or Dart. And therefore (as we may obſerve) of theſe Wounds made with the Sword, (as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Wounds inflicted on the Belly, Guts, and Bladder) many have been recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but it is a very rare thing for any to be cured of thoſe Wounds that are inflicted by Gun-ſhot.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But although that thoſe Wounds be far more dangerous then the wounds that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the Sword; yet notwithſtanding we muſt not raſhly forſake the Patient, and give the Cure over; ſeeing that even here Nature is likewiſe wont oftentimes to work miracles as in were; and it hath been obſerved that very many of thoſe that ſeemd to have been neer unto the Grave, have yet nevertheleſs recovered, and done well: and Hiſtories to this purpoſe we very frequently meet withal, and they are well known: and <hi>Guilhelmus Fabricius</hi> giveth us likewiſe a very notable Obſervation, and a ſingular way of Curing theſe kinde of Wounds; as we may finde it in the <hi>third B.</hi> of his <hi>Obſervations.</hi>

If ſuch Wounds befal a Cacochymical Body, they are much more dangerous then if they happen unto a ſound Body: from whence it is, that in Armies (in which Epidemical Diſeaſes are wont to reign and rage) moſt of thoſe that are thus wounded die of their Wounds. Yea and otherwiſe alſo in Camps thoſe Wounds are dangerous, and become more difficult to Cure; in regard that the Air is for the moſt part infected with the Naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Defilements of the Camp; and that Souldiers (for want of better food, and fit wholeſom drink) for the moſt part uſe a very bad and corrupt Courſe of Diet; eating any meats whatſoever that come next to hand, and drinking filthy and corrupt waters.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Thoſe wounds wherein the bones are broken are far more dangerous, and difficult to Cure, then thoſe without this Fracture of the bones.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Theſe kind of wounds if they be inflicted by a poyſoned bullet, they are indeed then greatly dangerous, and for the moſt part Mortal, and more eſpecially if they pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate unto the interior parts.

                        <p>Theſe kind of Wounds have eſpecially three indications. The Firſt is this, the drawing forth of the bullet, if it as yet ſtick in the part; The Second is, the converting of the battered and bruiſed fleſh into <hi>Pus;</hi> and the Third is that in common with al other Wounds, to wit, that the Wound be filled up with fleſh, and then at length ſhut up with a Cicatrice.</p>

                     <head>Of the drawing forth of the Bullets.</head>
                     <p>And Firſt of all therefore the Bullets are to be drawn forth of the Wound; and this is to be done either at the very firſt dreſſing; or if it be not then fit to be done, or that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then be done; we are then to do it at ſome other time during the Cure. Now the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets are wont to be drawn forth the ſame way they went in, and likewiſe that way whither they tend: for if the bullet ſhall pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate very deep, ſo that it be found to be neerer unto the oppoſite part, and that through the Skin and the Fleſh lying under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it may be felt; then the part being opened by an inciſion, the bullet is by it to be drawn forth. But if the bullet ſhall not pierce ſo deep that it may conveniently be drawn forth on the oppoſite part; then the ſearching Inſtrument being put into the Wound that way the bullet went in, the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let is to be ſought for, and it being found, we muſt then attempt to draw it forth by a fit Inſtrument; which are various, and very different in their length and breadth.</p>
                     <p>Now there are theſe three things required in this extraction or drawing forth of the bullet. The Firſt is, that the way be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently opened by the Inſtrument. And then Secondly, that the bullet be laid hold on. Now the Inſtrument taketh hold of the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, either as a pair of Cizers, or elſe as it faſteneth it ſelf (in its extream part, or point) into the bullet; either when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth it within its Cavity; or elſe when it layeth hold thereon by its extream part, made like unto a Saw. And from hence there ſprings a great variety of Inſtruments; of the which ſome lay hold on the bullet, and draw it forth as they are faſtened into the bullet: and others of them Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the bullets, as they are broader and hollow at the end; and others, as they are in their extream parts notcht and made like unto Saws; of which ſome are ſtraight, and others ſomwhat Crooked, according as the Wound is in its progreſs either ſtraight or oblique. And Thirdly, the Bullet being laid hold on by the Inſtrument it is by the Chirurgeons hand together with the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be drawn forth. The Inſtruments that are fit for this purpoſe we may find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in <hi>Paraeus</hi> his <hi>tenth B.</hi> and 14. <hi>Chapt.</hi> in <hi>John Andraeas a Cruce,</hi> and <hi>Guilhelm. Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> in his. 1. <hi>Cent. Obſervat.</hi> 88. where he ſheweth us a very eaſie way of drawing out theſe bullets with Inſtruments there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and delineated; and by a new invention of his own he maketh that known common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the form of a Wimblet, more apt and fit (then it was before) for the drawing forth of theſe Leaden bullets. For whereas if the Common Wimble be faſtened in the Bullet, the ſaid bullet may eaſily be ſtirred
<pb n="2700" facs="tcp:49110:192"/> and turn'd about together with the Wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: which to prevent, he firſt of all puts down (very gently) a pipe of Silver, or Iron, or Braſs, poliſhed and made as ſmooth as poſſibly may be, and then anoynted with the Oyl of Roſes; and this he thruſteth down even as far as the bullet. And then after this he conveyeth in another pipe or little Cane, at the one end toothed, or like unto a Saw; and ſo indeed, that the teeth thereof paſs from the left unto the right, and that they may hindea the bullets being turned about when the Wimble is faſtened in it. And then at length by this Second pipe the Wimble is let down; and when it ſhall be found to be ſufficiently fixed in the bullet, then the Wimble with the Bullet (and both the pipes) is to be drawn forth. But if the bullet cannot be found out by the probe or ſearching inſtrument (as it happeneth now and then in wounds when they are very deep) then the Wound is a long time to be kept open, and ſuppurating Medicaments to be made uſe of; and the Member is ſo to be placed, that the bullet may fall forth of it by its own weight. And ſo ſometimes we have known it, that Weapons or bullets that have layn hid for a while in the body, they have at length (in the progreſs of time) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been drawn forth by the help of Art, or elſe they have been expelled by Nature. Unto Nature therefore (if the bullet cannot be found out) the whol buſineſs is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and the ſame is likewiſe to be done, if there be any danger at all in the drawing of it forth, and the rather, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that leaden bullets may lie long, and be carried about in the body, without any hurt or detriment at all unto the Wounded party; which cannot be ſaid touching Iron or Braſs bullets, which becauſe that they contract a Ruſtineſs, they will not ſuffer the Wound to be healed.</p>
                     <p>But yet nevertheleſs, if the bullet ſtick faſt in any Noble parts or that part that may eaſily draw the Noble part into a Conſent with it, and that by reaſon of the Wound in it ſelf the Patients life ſeem to be much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered; the Chirurgeon ought not in this Caſe ſo much as to attempt the drawing forth of the bullet, ſince that by this means he cannot bring any help at al unto the wounded perſon, but may very eaſily haſten on that death, which the wound of it ſelf would have brought upon the Party.</p>
                     <p>But then it is not the Bullets alone that are to be taken forth; but becauſe that by means of theſe oftentimes the ſpills or ſplinters of Wood, Paper, fragments, and pieces of Arms, and Garments, and other things of this nature, are violently carried into the wound; al theſe therefore are in the firſt place to be drawn forth, &amp; indeed this extraction is moſt fitly put in practiſe in the very beginning, and ſo ſoon as ever the Wound is made, in regard that the pain is as yet but little, &amp; ſo likewiſe the inflammation is not ſo great as afterwards. But yet nevertheleſs, if ſuch things as theſe cannot be drawn forth at the firſt dreſſing of the Wound; this is then to be done in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing dreſſings.</p>

                     <p>And indeed, it may likewiſe verry wel be, that in theſe wounds there may be need both of veneſection and purgation. But ſince that neither of theſe is proper unto the Wounds we are now treating of, but common unto them with other wounds, thoſe things that we ſpake before on this ſubject touching wounds in general, may likewiſe here take place.</p>

But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the bruiſed parts may eaſily receive and gain a putridneſs, and that there may be great danger of a Gangrene nigh at hand, thoſe ordinary and common digeſtive and ſuppurating Medicaments that are made uſe of in other tumors and wounds, here ſimply have no place; eſpecially if any of the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts chance to be bruiſed; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wel bear nor admit of ſuch kind of moyſt and ſimply Oyly and fat Medicaments, and require thoſe that are dryer; but ſuch are to be made uſe of that do in very deed make for the turning of the bruiſed fleſh into <hi>Pus,</hi> and yet not produce any putridneſs.

But I conceive that great caution is to be had in thus doing; and that nothing is to be done raſhly. For though where there is preſent a putridneſs, and fear of a Gangrene nigh at hand, I do not at al diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the admixture of the ſaid precipitate Mercury; yet nevertheleſs I ſay, that in all wounds whatſoever inflicted by Gunſhot this is not either Neceſſary, or alwaies ſafe, ſince that experience teſtifieth, that many ſuch wounds have been cured without the admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="2701" facs="tcp:49110:192"/> of Mercury; and there are many other Medicaments more ſafe, that may prevent and keep off this putridneſs. And if the Nervous places chance to be wounded, this <hi>Precipitate Mercury</hi> may very eaſily occaſion an extraordinary great pain.</p>

But when the <hi>Pus</hi> begins again to be diminiſhed in its abundance, it will ſuffice then twice a day to open and cleanſe the Wound. And at length, when there floweth forth very little of the ſaid <hi>Pus,</hi> and that the Wound beginneth to be filled up with fleſh, it will then be ſufficient to open, cleanſe, and binde up the Wound once a day, as at the firſt.

                     <p>But if the wounded part begin once to be taken with a Gangrene, then the cure is ſo to be ordered as we told you before, in the laſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of the ſecond part, touching a Gangrene.</p>
                     <p>But now this is one thing that eſpecially renders wounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by Guns difficult to be cured,<note place="margin">Wounds with a fracture of the Bones.</note> when in the Arms, the thighes, and the Ankles, bones are broken; yea and many times ſhattered into divers fragments; in which, ſince that for the moſt part the Nervous parts are hurt, when theſe come to be purged from theſe fragments of the bones, there wil from thence ariſe moſt ſharp and acute pains, convulſions, yea and the Gangrene it ſelf, after all. Which if it happen, the Common Chirurgeons frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſten all they can to the amputation and cutting off of the whole Member. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though notwithſtanding, that this may ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be done; yet nevertheleſs this is not to be put in practiſe ſo long as there is any the leaſt hope left of a Cure; ſeeing that Nature is wont even in theſe wounds alſo to work miracles as it were.</p>
                     <p>The way of Curing is the ſame as of frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with a wound; of which we ſhal treat further in the next part, to wit, the fifth, and the Second Chapter. The firſt and main care therefore muſt be, that the great frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the bones be reſtored again unto their places, and that they may be there Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together: But yet nevertheleſs in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of the ſplinters (which are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wont to be applyed in the fractures of the bones) there ought great caution to be had; ſince that by the uſe of them there may eaſily be excited a pain, Convulſion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, &amp; at length the Gangrene it ſelf; unto which Maladies theſe Wounds are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe obnoxious; like as alſo thoſe Glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinating Cataplaſms, (which ſtick ſo cloſe and faſt unto the part, and bind it ſo ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together) have here no place; neither are they raſhly and inconſiderately to be made uſe of, becauſe that they bind together and ſtreighten the part, and thereby cauſe pain. It is therefore moſt convenient, that after the bones are again compoſed and conjoyned, the Member be placed and faſtened in a thin plate of Lead, or in a skin moyſtened, or with thoſe ſlivers or chips that wheel-wrights (while they hollow the holes of their Carts and Wains) cut forth with the hollow Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or Wimble, after they have been firſt moyſtened with water. For all theſe things as they hold the broken part together, ſo they do it in ſuch a manner, that they may notwithſtanding be bent as much as you pleaſe, that ſo they may not cauſe any pain.</p>
                     <p>But now in the ſtead of thoſe Cataplaſms there may be layd on ſome Emplaſter or Cerote. As,</p>

                  <p>TOuching thoſe poyſoned Wounds, you are to underſtand that theſe poyſoned Wounds require a peculiar kind of Cure by themſelves; whether it be by poyſon put u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the bullets, Arrows, Darts, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever other kind of poyſoned Weapons; or elſe by the biting of any living Creature, as a Dog, or a fierce and raging Wolf, or ſome other poyſonous Creature; or elſe by the blow of a Scorpion, Aſpe, or any other venemous Creature whatſoever. And the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth is that thoſe wounds that are thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the biting or ſtrokes of poyſonous Creatures (whether wild beaſts or any other) they do more hurt by their venemous quality then by the Wound it ſelf; which for the moſt part is but ſleight, and of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereas thoſe Wounds that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by poyſoned weapons do not only hurt by their poyſonous quality, and by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the poyſon wherewith they are infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but they are likewiſe oftentimes very dangerous ſimply as they are Wounds.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not here paſs over in ſilence that Diſeaſe which is contracted from Scarifications;<note place="margin">The Moravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Diſeaſe.</note> ſome have called it the new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of Moravia, and the ſickneſs of <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> becauſe that it firſt of all began to ſhew it ſelf at <hi>Brunna</hi> a town in <hi>Moravia,</hi> in the year 1577. touching which <hi>Thomas Jordan</hi> hath publiſhed a ſpecial Treatiſe, which <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han.

The Sum of the whole buſineſs is this in brief. <hi>Al whoſoever they were that in the year</hi> 1577. <hi>on St. Lucies day</hi> (from what followeth notwithſtanding I Collect this, that not only thoſe that were thus ſcarifyed on the firſt day of Winter were taken with this Malady; but that all likewiſe that made uſe of theſe Scarifications from that firſt day of Winter, even unto the vernal or ſpring Solſtice) <hi>went into their publique Bath at Brunna, and had theſe ſcarifications admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to them, they inſtantly ſeemed to be taken and ſurpriſed with this Malady. Neither did they yet preſently perceive the hurt and miſchief thereof, although that forthwith there appeared ſome certain ſigns of the diſeaſe, now gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. There were ſome that had the diſeaſe lying hid, and not diſcovering it ſelf for the ſpace of Eight days; in others the Malady lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed a fortnight, and in others during the whol time of their courſes; to wit, according to the ſtrength both of the Malady, as alſo of the party now affected therewith: But at length it manifeſted it ſelf publiquely. In the mean time thoſe that were taken with the diſeaſe were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be affected with an univerſal kind of ſloath and dull ſluggiſhneſs; and being thus taken with ſloathfulneſs they became lazy, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unfit and indiſpoſed for the diſcharge of their Callings and wonted buſineſs; and they were likewiſe Melancholly, and of a ſad counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The Native freſh colour of their face was ſuddenly turned into a paleneſs, the Vigor and quickneſs of their eyes into wilde and fierce lookes, there appearing in them a deformity with a dun and duskie Circle as it uſeth to be in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have their Courſes upon them. And then it ſoon diſcovered it ſelf by manifeſt and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſigns. After the application of Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping glaſſes, they were immediatly invaded by an extreme great and incurable heat; and after this there followed filthy impoſthumations, and
<pb n="2705" facs="tcp:49110:194"/> putrid rotten <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, flowing with</hi> Sanies <hi>and foul black gore-Blood: and round about there appeared alſo certain puſhes at broad as the Palm of the Hand, together with other running ſores; out of which when they gaped, and were opened either with the Needle, or Medicaments, there iſſued forth a thin pituitous or Flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick matter, wheyiſh, and rotten, as alſo a ſnot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sanies; and in others this thin pituitous matter was likewiſe ſharp and corroding: then the Fleſh al of it that was comprehended within the Circumference of the Cupping-Glaſs being corroded and putrifying ſent forth a ſtinking ſavour, ſuch as is wont to ariſe from the Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian Phagedaenical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers. Where it was worth obſervation, and to be wondred at in the very beginning, that of ſo many Cupping-Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as were affixed (ſome having had ten or there about, and others alſo not above three of theſe Cupping-Glaſſes faſtened and affixed unto their Fleſh,) only one of them, or two at the moſt, of all theſe, brought forth any of the ſaid filth and Corruption; the Mother in Law of one</hi> Laurentius <hi>a Taylor only excepted, who of fifteen that were applied, had three that produced of the aforeſaid impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumated matter. You might have ſeen ſome of them with their whole bodies all overſpread with Puſtules or Puſhes (as we cal them) their Face deformed, their Countenance ſad and dejected, their looks terrible and frightful, their Back, Breaſt, Belly, Feet, even all places from the Head to the Foot of them, polluted and defiled with a ſcurfie ſcabbineſs, and with Cruſty <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers lifted up a little above the Skin, as broad at the Nail of ones Thumb, with a red Circle, and a white ſuperficies and outſide. And out of theſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers alſo did continually run a kinde of Fat liquor, and other Excrementitious filth and corruption, that did more reſemble the thin and cleer Sanies, then the thicker Excrement that we cal</hi> Pus. <hi>Yea and moreover, the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bineſs being removed and cured, there ſtil remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned certain black ſpots, ſomewhat differing from thoſe that appear in the</hi> Impetigo <hi>and the</hi> Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligo, <hi>which are of a dark, Leaden, and Duskie colour. In the progreſs of the Diſeaſe there grew together in the Head certain Callous or hard Cruſts, which being with the greateſt pain broken or diffected did ſweat forth a kinde of matter not unlike unto Honey, and very tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (ſuch a kinde of Juyce as we may ſee to deſtil from thoſe Trees that bear a fruit like unto the Pine Apple) a certain ſubſtance (I ſay) thick and clammy, and therefore an Argument of the ripening and withering away of the flegm. Theſe ſordid and filthy impoſtumes (they being indeed of the worſt ſort of all others) were no ſooner throughly cleanſed and purged with a great deal of trouble, and much difficulty; and no ſooner were thoſe parts grown together with a little fleſh brought over them, but out there breads a new Symptom. The Limbs of the whole Body, the Arms, Shoulders, Shoulder-Blades, Elbows, Calves of the Legs, Ankles, and bottom of the Feet, they were all extreamly twinged and pulled with a certain kind of pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, like unto ſtings; and as if they had been ſawn aſſunder with ſome Iron Inſtrument. The members were all of them ſo heavy by reaſon of their weight, that they needed ſomthing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derprop them, and bear them up: yea and many of them alſo that had a palſie threatened unto them were fain of neceſſity to be born up, and carried upon mens Shoulders: And yet for all this they had no reſt day nor night, being wrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with continual and inceſſant pains. And theſe tormenting pains were not for a day or two, but they laſted commonly for the ſpace of a whole moneth. And the Head likewiſe that was not free. For beſides the Achores above mentioned, together with the Gummy and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous riſings therein, (not unlike unto great warts) it was grievouſly infeſted with vehement pains (and eſpecially about the hinder Region thereof) which by reaſon of the weakneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the Parties ſtrength, as alſo through the want of due reſt and ſleep, cauſed many of them to be Mad; which ſaid Madneſs of theirs left them not until for a long while together very much of the aforeſaid purulent ſnot and filth (of a moſt offenſive and ſtinking Savour) had run forth from the Head by the Noſethrils. And all the whol time that the Diſeaſe had its courſe they took no pleaſure at all in the gifts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of</hi> Ceres <hi>or</hi> Bacchus, <hi>that is ſay, they were not at all delighted with their Food, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meat or Drink, They abhorred likewiſe and ſhun'd all manner of converſe with others, either out of ſhame, or elſe for Anger and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, when they beheld themſelves (without any deſert on their part, as they thought) quite over ſpread with a horrible and Contagious Diſeaſe, and of which they had ſmal hope to be recovered. This Diſeaſe continued the whole Winter long, even until the ſpring Equinoctial, that is, the Suns Entrance into the ſign of Aries; about which time it manifeſtly decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and was Judged to be quite ceaſed about Eaſter; becauſe that after that time there was none found to be wholly overſpread with this ſtrange and (until then) unheard of Diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As touching the riſe and original of this Diſeaſe, there were two Opinions eſpecially. For ſome there were that thought it to be a new kind of the French Diſeaſe, by Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or infection propagated in the hot Houſe or Stove of the Bath: but others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that this poyſon was communicated by the Scarification, The Chief Magiſtrate of the Town made a very diligent and ſtrict
<pb n="2706" facs="tcp:49110:195"/> enquiry as touching the Cauſe of this Diſeaſe; but he could finde very little or nothing of a certainty. <hi>Johan. Sporiſchius</hi> (in his <hi>Tract before alleadged</hi>) admits of neither of theſe Cauſes before mentioned: but he conceiveth that this Malady had its original from a Pituitous and Flegmatick Cacochymy, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in the Body by the unhealthy Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of that year; and withal that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much and Unſeaſonable Scarification drew theſe vitious Humors unto the Scarified places. And that he may the better prove this, he writeth many things touching the Scituation of this Town, and concerning the Dyet, and the Diſeaſes of the inhabitants: and from all theſe put together he proveth that there was collected great ſtore of this Flegmatick Humor.</p>
                  <p>And the truth is, that it is not altogether ſo plain and evident, from whence that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was at firſt contracted. For if it had its original from Scarification; then the Cauſe is not evident, wherefore this infection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued only from the Winter until the vernal or Spring Aequinoctial, and no longer (unleſs haply any one wil render this for a cauſe, that after this time none durſt by reaſon of the fear they apprehended of a danger, make uſe of theſe Baths, or elſe becauſe that this Bath was almoſt deſtroyed, and then again renewed) and why all the parts unto which the Scarified Cupping-Glaſſes were affixed were not exulcerated. For (in the Hiſtories of the infected) <hi>Thomas Jordanus</hi> taketh notice, that a certain perſon who had five of theſe Cupping-Glaſſes affixed unto ſeveral places of his Body, yet that only two of all thoſe places, (to wit, the hinder part of the Neck, and the Region of the left Loyn) were exulcerated; and he telleth us likewiſe of a certain Maid-ſervant that had ſeven of theſe Cupping-Glaſſes applied unto ſeveral parts; of all which, the Skin was exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only under one of them, to wit, that which was affixed unto the right Shoulder-Blade: and there he aſſureth us that the very ſame happened alſo unto many others. But now, this ſeemeth to make very much againſt thoſe who will have this Malady to proceed from the vitious conflux and ſtoring up of the Humors, to wit, that there being at that ſame time three publique Baths at <hi>Brunna,</hi> they only were infected who made uſe of Scarification in that <hi>Adams</hi> Bath, which ought likewiſe to have happened altogether alike in them all, if the Diſeaſe had its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the vitious Humors gotten together in the Body. But the opinion of <hi>Sporiſchius</hi> (as he determineth that this affect proceeded from the pituitous or Flegmatick Humor) doth no way deſerve that any aſſent ſhould be given unto it. For it eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth unto any one that well weigheth the Hiſtory, and conſidereth the Symptoms of this Diſeaſe, that the Cauſe of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was from ſomwhat that was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous.</p>
                  <p>And yet nevertheleſs the Second opinion ſeemeth to me the more probable. For (like as <hi>Crato</hi> taketh notice, and giveth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) ſince that there was not any one infected beſides thoſe that uſed Scarification, (and that alſo in this Bath only, and not in any other) it is therefore very likely and moſt agreeable to the truth, that by cuts and wounds inflicted by Scarification there was ſome kinde of poyſon derived unto the Body; whether this poyſon were imparted to the Body by the edg of the Penknife infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or elſe by the Cupping-Glaſs, or by ſome poyſonous Vapour of the Bath, or from the Water, or by whatſoever other means it were. For it is a thing generally wel known that Arrows are by many Nations infected with Poyſon; which might likewiſe as well be done in the Penknife wherewith the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification was made, whether this came to paſs by the Malice and wickedneſs of the keeper of the Bath, or elſe by his careleſneſs and want of Circumſpection; whiles that with the very ſame Knife with which he Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſome impure perſon, he likewiſe Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified others, who were therby infected; ſeeing that it is a truth very well known, that the opening of a Vein hath oftentimes fallen out very much amiſs, that hath been performed by the ſame Penknife wherwith another mans Ulcer hath been opened. This poyſon might likewiſe be communicated unto the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Knife from the Hone or Whetſtone, (upon which theſe Inſtruments are wont to be rubbed hard, thereby to have an edg ſet upon them) if from the Vapor of the Bath any filth and Malignity ſhould chance to ſtick unto them. There might likewiſe ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion cleave faſt unto the Cupping-Glaſſes, that are not alwaies wiped and made clean with that care and diligence as they ought to be. And Laſtly, it is not altogether impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the Vapour of the Bath might inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate it ſelf into the Skin newly Scarified; or elſe into the water with the which the Scarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed places are waſhed: which ſaid Vapor is not evermore pure, but is ſomtimes defiled and infected by the ſweatings, and filth, that come from divers perſons. And that which alſo maketh much hereunto, may be this, that from thoſe very Stones upon which the water is poured forth for the heating of the Stove or hot Houſe there is lifted up great ſtore of Vapors, which are not alwaies p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Poyſoned Wounds if they be inflicted by poyſonous Creatures, this will appear by the relation of the ſick perſon; and even by this it wil be known, that thoſe Wounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from ſuch kind of Creatures, becauſe that they are envenomed. But if the Patient be wounded with a Dart, or any other kinde of Weapon, or a Leaden bullet, this is known by the extream great ſenſe of pain and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that is felt in the wounded place; and by this alſo, that the Natural colour of the wounded part is quite altered and changed, degenerating into a Wanneſs and Leaden colour, or blackneſs; and that inſtantly upon it grievous Symptoms (for which no Reaſon can poſſibly be given) do follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wound; and that in the whole Body there is perceived and felt, ſomtimes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary heat and burning, and ſomtimes a kinde of ſtupidity and great ſtreightning of the Heart, and ſomtimes the trembling of the Heart, together with dangerous fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſwooning Fits.</p>
                     <p>For ſo ſoon as ever the poyſon is received in by the Veins and Arteries, it immediatly diffuſeth it ſelf throughout the whole Body, and oppugneth the moſt principal members, and eſpecially the Heart, (as it is the Nature of all poyſons ſo to do) from whence divers Symptoms are excited.

                     <p>It ſufficiently appeareth what Indications a wound, conſidered as a wound, pointeth out unto us, and ſupplyeth thus withal; and it is likewiſe ſufficiently manifeſt (by what hath hitherunto been ſaid) how it is to be cured. But now if we look upon it as poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then we are to endeavour in the firſt place, that this poyſon may not penetrate unto the more interior parts, eſpecially the Heart; and then in the next place, that its power and ſtrength may be broken and weakned by Alexipharmick Medicaments, which we commonly term Counter-Poyſons. And therefore firſt of all, we ought carefully to heed whether any part of the poyſoned
<pb n="2708" facs="tcp:49110:196"/> Weapon yet ſtick faſt within the Wound. For indeed all our attempts of curing the Wound wil be fruſtrated, unleſs the weapon be drawn forth; and therefore we muſt labor that with all poſſible ſpeed it may be taken forth by the operation of the hand: but if it cannot thus be taken forth, then together with the emplaſters which have a power in them of calling forth the poyſon, we are to mingle with them thoſe things that are able to draw forth the Weapons and all other extraneous bodyes out of the Wounds; touching which we have ſpoken above in the eighth Chapter. And then moreover, that ſo the poyſon may not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate unto the more inward parts, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the heart, firſt of all (as <hi>Celſus</hi> in his fifth Book, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 27. teacheth us) <hi>that member is to be bound up upon the wound, but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this binding muſt not be overhard and ſtreight, leſt that the member ſhould hereby be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, and loſe all its ſenſe and feeling;</hi> or that (which ſomtimes through the unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Chirurgeons cometh to paſs) it ſhould be taken with a Gangrene. Then the poyſon it ſelf is to be drawn forth, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out unto the more external parts. The Ancients to extract and call forth the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, were wont to appoint the ſucking of the wound; and they who performed this office they termed <hi>Pſylly;</hi> and they thought that theſe had a kind of propriety of attracting and drawing forth the poyſon by ſucking, and alſo of reſiſting the ſayd poyſon; whereas the truth is that it was only to ſhew their boldneſs and adventurouſneſs in thus doing; touching which <hi>Celſus</hi> in his fifth Book, <hi>Chapt</hi> 27. thus writeth: <hi>but if this indeed</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>be not done (that is, if there be want of a Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſs, or the like) then a Man is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, who may ſuck the poyſon out of the wound. Neither indeed have theſe men (whom they call Pſylly) any more ſpecial and peculiar knowledg then others; but only a boldneſs and confidence confirmed by much uſe and practiſe. For the Poyſon of a ſerpent (as likewiſe ſome certain poyſons that Huntſmen uſe) hurt not by their taſt, but only they impoyſon a Wound. And preſently he adds; and therefore</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>whoſoever he be that following the example of thoſe Pſylly, ſhall ſuck the Wound, (and yet would both himſelf be ſafe, and ſo alſo preſerve him for whom he doth this office) let him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend this advice (that ſo he periſh not) that he admit not of any part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer into his Gums, or his Palate, or any other part of hit mouth.</hi> Now the truth is that the poyſon is moſt ſafely drawn forth by Cuppingglaſſes eſpecially in the bittings and ſtrokes of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Creatures; which ſaid Cuppingglaſſes wil draw forth the poyſon the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, if unto them there be added and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered Scarifications; and eſpecially if they be made deeper then otherwiſe upon ſleight occaſions. After the removal of the Cuppingglaſſes, then the Gutts of Hens or other birds, or (if you pleaſe) the bodies of them being cut in the midſt, the parts whiles they are yet hot may be layd upon the Wound. And if the place be not nervous, (in the bitings of theſe poyſonous Creatures) the fleſh round about it is to be pared away, yea and quite cut off: And <hi>Galen</hi> relateth of a certain vine-dreſſer, that being bitten by a viper he preſently with the pruning hook cut off the ſinger that was bitten; and ſo by thus doing eſcaped and avoyded all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

But if the ſick perſon wil not admit of an Actual Cautery, then the potentiall Cautery, or cauſtick Medicaments are to be adminiſtred. And care is likewiſe to be taken that the Eſchar may fall off as ſoon as may be; and if it fall not off ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of it ſelf, the wound is to be freed therefrom with the penknife; neither is the ulcer immediatly to be glutinated; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Onyon with Salt, or Wild Garlick, or Rue, are to be impoſed upon the wound.</p>

And therefore in ſuch parts the ſafeſt way wil be to apply thoſe Medicaments only that draw forth the poyſon by the property of their ſubſtance.

                     <p>And indeed in the firſt place, it happeneth very often that Fevers follow upon Wounds And therefore although I have already trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Feavers in a peculiar Tract by its ſelf; yet nevertheleſs, in regard that it much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth us to know, and rightly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the differences of Feavers that follow upon Wounds, (that ſo we may the better remove them) we wil therefore herein this place ſpeak ſomthing of them inſpeciall, and particularly.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, firſt of al, we are diligently to inquire what the nature of this Feaver is that followeth upon the Wound, and what the Cauſe of it. For theſe kind of Feavers are very various; ſome of them being every day Feavers, having their Original from the great diſturbance of the ſpirits, and the boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of the blood; by reaſon of anger, Fear, and upon all occaſions of the humors being diſturbed by the motion of the body, or the commotion of the Mind. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alſo, Secondly, theſe feavers happen while the <hi>Pus</hi> (and eſpecially if there be great ſtore of it) is in breeding, according to that of the 47. <hi>Aphor.</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Sect.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from an Inflammation; Fourthly, and ſomtimes theſe putrid Feavers are likewiſe generated from the putridneſs that is in the wounded part.

                     <p>The firſt kind of Feavers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeth the Patient at the firſt in the very beginning;<note place="margin">The firſt kind of ſeaver from the diſturbance of the humors,</note> and (as I told you before) it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the paſſion of the mind, and the motion of the body, and the diſturbance of the blood and ſpirits follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon. And hitherto alſo belongeth moſt vehement pain, which by dſturbing the humors, and cauſing reſtleſneſs, may both ſet on fire thoſe humors, and the ſpirits, and likewiſe excite a Feaver.</p>

                        <p>The Cure conſiſteth in this eſpecially, that the putridneſs in the part affected be with all ſpeed, and as much as may be, reſtrained and kept under, and that by all means poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there be a way and paſſage made for the vitious matter to flow forth. For the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridneſs being taken away and removed, the Feaver ſoon after eaſily vaniſheth of its own accord.</p>
                        <p>And Laſtly, There is alſo a kinde of Feaver,<note place="margin">A Feaver from the vitious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Humors.</note> which ariſeth (in wounded perſons) from the ſtoring up and the great provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that hath been made of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and naughty Humors, and the ill preparation of them. For if the wounded Body be impure, it may then eaſily be, that a Feaver may be kindled in it upon the occaſion of the Wound. Now this is done in a twofold manner, and upon a double account. Firſt of all, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and diſturbance of the Spirits and Humors, after the receiving of the Wound. For as in Bodies otherwiſe impure there are Feavers oftentimes kindled from the paſſions of the minde, and Commotion of the Body, (even as we ſee it to befal Women that have hard labour in Child-bed) ſo the very ſame may likewiſe happen in thoſe that are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And furthermore a Feaver is alſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from a putridneſs in the wounded part. For as in Child-bearing Women there are Feavers oftentimes kindled from the reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Secundine, and the blood that uſually floweth from them after the Childe is born; (and this ſo much the more eaſily, if their Bodies be impure) even ſo if any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridneſs be kindled in the wounded part, and that the depraved Vapors communicated unto the Veins do finde any vitious Humors in theſe Veins, then a Feaver ariſeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Now theſe Feavers are various, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different preparation of the vitious Humors;) ſomtimes intermitting, and ſometimes continual; according as this treaſury of the vitious Humors is laid up ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> (viz. the great hollow Vein) or elſe ſticketh faſt in the ſame; and indeed for the moſt part they are Tertians either continued or intermitting, (ſingle, or double) and very rarely Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; and moſt ſeldom, Quartans.</p>

                     <p>Now very often there happeneth unto Wounds an Inflammation; and ſomtimes likewiſe an <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi> And indeed an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation doth moſt commonly (if not evermore) follow upon the inflicting of a Wound; and more eſpecially in the Nervous parts; in regard that the afflux of Blood unto the part affected ſtirreth up and cauſeth a pain therein; and moreover, becauſe that the Blood when it cannot ſufficiently flow forth from thence it putrifieth, and very eaſily exciteth an Inflammation, which is prevented by a due and ſufficient efflux of the Blood; touching which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thus writeth, in his <hi>B. of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If there flow forth of the Wound Blood more or leſs, according to the ſtrength of the wounded perſon, then both the Wound it ſelf, and thoſe parts that are neer about it are the leſs troubled and affected with any Inflammation that ſhall follow upon the Wound.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore if there be any cauſe to fear an Inflammation; and if the blood hath not ſufficiently flown forth, then forthwith a Vein is to be opened in the oppoſite place; and the Blood is to be evacuated according to the ſtrength of the ſick perſon, and as he is well able to bear it. Yea and moreover, if there be already preſent an Inflammation, and that the Patients ſtrength will bear it (and neceſſity ſo require) Veneſection and Purgation are both of them to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, according as there ſhall be need.</p>
                     <p>If the Inflammation be excited from pain, then we are to endeavour that the ſaid pain be taken away, and withal that the afflux of Humors be repreſſed. <hi>Avicen</hi> for this uſe highly commendeth the Cataplaſm that is made of the <hi>Pomegranate</hi> boyled in aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Wine, then bruiſed in a Mortar, and ſo made up into the form of a Cataplaſm.

<pb n="2716" facs="tcp:49110:200"/> before and behind) and the whole ſpinal Marrow with Convenient Medicaments; ſuch as we have already mentioned in the place alleadged. <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> (in his firſt <hi>B. Chap.</hi> 77.) Commendeth this following.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Bays, of Juniper Wood, of Juniper Berryes, Mans Fat, and Oyl of Earth Worms, of each four ounces; Oyl of Roſemary flowers, Laven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der flowers, and Sage flowers, of each two ounces; Oyl of Peter, and of Turpentine, of each half a pound; Oyl of Tile, and the oyl of Been, of each three ounces and an half; Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Ladanum, Benzoin, and Gum Juniper, of each three ounces; Oyl of Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom, of Cloves, Mace, Nutmeg, of each one ounce and half; Bdellium two ounces: Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum, Opopanax, Galbanum; of each one ounce; Indian Tacamahaca, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anna, of each four ounces; Caſtoreum, and Saffron, of each ſix drams; the Root of the herb Maſterwort.

                     <hi>Chap. 24.</hi> Whether it be lawfull for a Chriſtian by Amulets, (the Greeks call them <hi>Periapta,</hi> we Preſervatives) or elſe by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Seals about their bodyes, or by the like means, to defend and preſerve themſelves from all danger by Weapons.</head>
                  <p>SInce that there is nothing now adays more frequently practiſed by Soldiers, then by certain Amulets (or Periapta) as alſo by Seals and Characters, to fence and Guard themſelves againſt all thruſts and Strokes of Weapons, and Gunſhot, (and ſo to render themſelves altogether inviolable;) before we end this diſcourſe touching Wounds, we think it not amiſs (for a Concluſion) to add and diſcuſs this queſtion; whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a Chriſtian, and whether he may with a ſafe Conſcience, (and without breach of Piety) in any ſuch manner as aforeſaid make his body weapon-proof, and impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable by Gunſhot.</p>
                  <p>For although I neither deſire to make any inquiry into the ſecret and private practiſes of theſe kind of Perſons, nor think it worth the while ſo to do; yet notwithſtanding this is a thing very well and commonly known, that theſe men cannot Guard and fortify themſelves from all kind of violence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; but only againſt the thruſts and ſtrokes of Swords, and other the like Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, as alſo from Musket and Piſtol bullets, ſo that ſuch like Weapons, and ſmaller Gun-ſhot ſhall not by any means be able to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate their skin. But yet theſe perſons may by Clubs be dry-beaten, and by bullets ſhot forth of the greater Guns (as Ordnance, and the like) be hurt and violated; yea they may hereby likewiſe be deſtroyed, although it be true, that their skin cannot eaſily be wounded. Yea moreover (even as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſs) there are ſome certain parts that cannot thus be ſafe-guarded and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved impenetrable and inviolable; and more eſpecially their Eyes. And moreover this is likewiſe commonly reported, that ſome of them can make not only themſelves, but that they can render even the bodies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo impenetrable and inviolable, that they ſhall not be hurt by any kind of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; yea that ſome of them are able to cauſe, that butter ſhall not be cut, either by knife, Sword, or by hatchet. And thirdly they report this alſo that ſuch as are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant and unwitting unto any ſuch practiſe, may likewiſe by others be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, and proof againſt all kind of Weapons and Darts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The various wayes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by which ſom make themſelves impenetrable by Weapons.</note>But now they have divers waies &amp; means of making themſelves thus impenetrable and weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proof, which I neither know nor deſire to know. In the general, I ſhall only acquaint you with one or two of thoſe things that are commonly carryed about by them; that ſo by them you may likewiſe know how the better to Judge of all the reſt. And firſt of all, it is ſcarcely unknown to any, that there are certain Seals or <hi>Pentacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> (as they call them) that are graven with figures and Characters, and ignorantly let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered (as <hi>Apuleius</hi> ſpeaketh) and theſe are carried up and down, and by the Souldiers
<pb n="2717" facs="tcp:49110:200"/> hung about their Necks; and they are wont alſo to be bound unto their Body; that ſo by them they may render themſelves inviol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and not to be hurt by any Weapons. And ſome there be, that only inſcribe theſe kind of Characters upon a piece of paper, and ſo hang them unto their Bodies. And I my ſelf knew a man, who reported that he hung one of theſe ſheets of Paper about the Neck of a Dog; and then he ſhot him cloſe at hand with a bullet out of a hand-Gun, and yet the Dog was not at all any whit hurt thereby. And there are ſome likewiſe, who ſwallow down theſe ſheets or pieces of paper thus Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured and Charactered. And there is extant in a certain publique writing an inſtance of the like Artifice (if we may ſo call theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions and impoſtures of the Devil) by which a certain Gentleman fenced and guarded his Body againſt all kinde of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. Which practiſe of that renowned Commander (that ſo valiantly and ſucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fought many battles againſt the Turks, in the behalf of the Chriſtians in <hi>Hungary</hi>) whether it make more for his praiſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor, I leave it free unto any one to Judg thereof. I ſhall only ſay this, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even great perſons (Princes and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies) have been deceived in this kinde, and have too incautelouſly given Credit unto theſe Cheaters and deceivers (who go up and down ſelling theſe things, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times putting them off at very dear rates) and have not ſufficiently weighed and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the dangerous conſequence of what they go about. And therefore, as for the Courſe that theſe men take (ſeeing that it is altogether ſuperſtitious &amp; impious) I do not think it any waies fit for me by my writings to propagate it unto Poſterity: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that the ſuperſtition and wickedneſs of this practiſe may appear, I will in the general ſpeak ſomwhat thereof, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> delineate it in ſome particulars. At the ſacred time of our Saviours Nativity (or as we call it, Chriſtmas) about midnight in a ſheet of Vellom or Parchment there are theſe letters inſcribed. I. N. R. I. and this ſame ſheet of Parchment is cloſed up in certain bals or Lumps of Wheaten dough, which are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily put upon the high Altar, that ſo at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and divers times three Maſſes may be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated over them. And then one of theſe little balls (with certain ſuperſtitious prayers they have for that purpoſe) muſt be eaten in the morning; and this wil for that day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the man ſafe and ſound from all kinde of Wounds whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame little Book, (the writing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned) we are taught, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner on the day any wound is inflicted, before Sunriſing, the Moſs is to be taken and ſhaved from the Skul of one that was hanged or broken upon the wheel, (and this with certain prayers) which if ſewed into the Garment under the left Arm-pit, and worn, will in like manner preſerve the man inviolable, and not to be hurt by any Wound.</p>
                  <p>And there are ſome alſo who Wound their Skin; and then they put upon the Wound theſe kinde of Parchments, or ſome other things Charactered (as before) and ſo they Conglutinate the ſaid wound, and cloſe it up. And there are likewiſe (without doubt) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch like waies and means well known to Souldiers; in the diſcovery of which I intend not at all to be Curious, or in the leaſt to trouble my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>If enquiry be made after the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe Diabolical Practiſes,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</note> the prime and chief of them are for the moſt part unknown; and theſe things are by the incautious Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers derived from one to another, and from hand to hand. And if we ſhould trace the Authors out even unto the very firſt of them, we ſhall finde the firſt Author hereof was (doubtleſs) ſome Devil and wicked Spirit, as we ſhall anon ſhew you. They do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that oftentimes hang-men or the common Executioners are the Authors of this wicked Artifice, as being a generation of Men for the moſt part much addicted unto Magick. And ſo the <hi>Paſſavian</hi> Art (as they cal it becauſe that it firſt came to be known in that Army which being raiſed about <hi>Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi> afterwards in the yeer 1611. brake into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> &amp; took <hi>Prague,</hi> and was every where divulged up and down the Country, and throughout <hi>Germany</hi>) at the firſt was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and made known unto the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by the common Executioner of that place.</p>
                  <p>If you enquire into the reaſon hereof; they firſt of all pretend experience, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg likewiſe great perſons Princes and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyes, who have by their Experiments found the truth hereof, and ſo have left it unto us as a <hi>Probatum,</hi> that any one may in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and by this means render himſelf inviol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſo as not to be hurt by any kinde of Weapons. And moreover, ſome there are that derive the virtue and Cauſe of this effect from the Conſtellations; and therefore it is that they teach us to make thoſe Seals (which they cal <hi>Periapta</hi> and <hi>Pentacula</hi>) under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conſtellations.</p>
                  <p>But in very truth, we deny not this indeed, that ſuch things as this may thus be done, and that they have been made uſe of by great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (Princes and others:) but the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is now touching this, whether ſuch like practiſes as theſe may be wrought by any Natural means; and whether a Chriſtian
<pb n="2718" facs="tcp:49110:201"/> Man or Woman may lawfully and without Impiety in this manner render himſelf inviol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and impenetrable; or elſe whether or no whatſoever ſhall be done in this kinde be not done by Magick and the Diabolical Art, and by a compact with the Devil; and ſo therfore that it is altogether unlawful, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and wicked, for any one in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to make his Body impenetrable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Thus to do ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful:</note> In which Queſtion we indeed defend the latter opinion;and we poſitively aſſert, that all the power, virtue and efficacy of the Means aforeſaid proceed from a compact and agreement with the Devil, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from the Devil himſelf; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that he (whoſoever he be) that ſhal by this kinde of Means endeavour to fence and guard his Body againſt the violence of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, ſhall by thus doing attempt a thing altogether impious and unbeſitting a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. <note place="margin">Reaſon proving the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of thus Practiſe:</note> For Firſt of al, moſt certain it is, that there is no ſuch virtue either in Metals, or in ſheets of Paper or Parchment, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and in their own Nature; but that they perform whatſoever is done, as they are marked with the aforeſaid Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters. But now there can be no ſuch virtue or efficacy in Figures and Characters; and therefore it will neceſſarily follow, that it proceedeth from ſome higher power; and this muſt be either from God, and the good Angels; or elſe from the Devil, that wicked Spirit. But it is no where extant in Holy Writ, that ever God did (either by himſelf, or the Miniſtery of the good Angels) work any ſuch thing; or that he ever promiſed ſo to do. And who is there that can beleeve, that ſuch an abuſe of ſacred Words, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like ſuperſtitious practiſes as have been before related, ſhould be approved of by thoſe good Angels: and therefore we muſt beleeve that they proceed from the Devil. And thus the Devil that he may ſeduce and withdraw men from the Worſhip and Service of Almighty God, and devote them unto himſelf, he maketh an Agreement and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with any one that will hearken unto him, that if he wil forſake God, and become his, he will then make him free and inviol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from the violence of all Weapons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſo long as he ſhall carry about him ſuch like Seals (or <hi>Periapta</hi> as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called) or ſhall devour the aforeſaid Characters inſcribed upon Paper. Unto which Compact they render themſelves Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, and give their Conſents, who ever they be that make uſe of the above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Characters. For thoſe Characters are the Devils Alphabet (if I may ſo term it) and as it were the Military pawn and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which he knows and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, when they implore his help and aſſiſtance. For albeit there are ſome who here conceive themſelves to be altogether free from all Idolatry, ſuperſtition, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and that they have herein no compact nor commerce with the Devil; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are herein greatly deceived, ſo long as they make uſe of Means that were never ordained by God, but ſuch as are of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>For there is a twofold compact with the Devil, to wit, Mediate,<note place="margin">A Compact with the Devil two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:</note> and immediate; or explicite, and implicite. The immediate and explicite is, when any one ſhall make uſe of means immediately delivered into his Hands by the Devil himſelf. But the Mediate or Implicite Compact is then, when any perſon ſhall make uſe of ſuch means as were at firſt preſcribed by the Devil, but yet ſuch as he hath not received immediatly from the Devil himſelf, but hath had them by others and from Hand to Hand delivered unto him. Both which we finde forbidden, and contrary to the Law of God, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth us to have any other Gods. Neither is it any whit to the purpoſe, that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny object, when they ſay, that it is no way probable, that compacts which others have entered into with the Devil, the guilt thereof ſhould become theirs, and bring them under the like impiety; ſeeing (ſaith they) that it is the conſent of the Covenanters that makes the compact: for in that Compact implicite or Mediate (as I have ſaid) the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is not altogether wanting. For whereas every one that hath but ſo much ſoundneſs of minde yet leſt him <hi>(that he knows how to ſhun Rocks and avoid the pit that ſtands wide open, and ready to devour him)</hi> will eaſily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that thoſe Characters or Words have no ſuch virtue in themſelves; and therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e before ever he make uſe of them he ought to inquire, by what power and virtue it is that they perform what they do. Which if he neglect to do, he then implicitely enters into a compact with the Devil, who hath made that promiſe that he will perform this for ſuch as ſhal make uſe of thoſe Characters and form of Words according to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; and ſo conſequently ſuch a one cannot at al be free from impiety. And that this is a truth thoſe two Hiſtories following will ſufficiently make good. <hi>Martinus del Rio</hi> in the 2. <hi>B.</hi> of his <hi>Magic. Diſquiſition. Quaeſt.</hi> 27. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.) relateth of <hi>Henricus Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Agrippa,</hi> who having at <hi>Lovain</hi> a youth boarding in his Houſe that was over curious and prying, it ſo came to paſs, that during
<pb n="2719" facs="tcp:49110:201"/> this youths abode with him, <hi>Agrippa</hi> having at length occaſion to ride a Journey far from his home, he delivered the keyes of his Study unto his Wife (whom he afterward put away by divorce) with this prohibition and charge that ſhe ſhould not ſuffer any to enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into in his abſence. But this youth having by his importunity and earneſt intreaty gotten leave to go into the ſtudy, and lighting upon a little Conjuring book, while he was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, lo a knocking at the Study door; but the perſiſting ſtil in his reading there is another knocking heard at the Study door, which the youth ſtill reading on and not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, the Divel entereth in, and asketh wherefore he was called; at which the youth being aſtoniſhed and ſo far affrighted that he could not make any ready anſwer, the Divel immediately choaked and ſtrangled him For as he that readeth any thing in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Language, he himſelf haply may not underſtand what he reads which yet one that ſtandeth by may underſtand; ſo it was here; although this youth knew not that he called for the Devil; yet notwithſtanding the Devil wel knowing his own watch-word, and the engagement or Compact he had entered into, ſoon came upon calling.</p>
                  <p>The other Hiſtory we have related by <hi>Henricus Brucaeus</hi> (in the <hi>Miſcellanies</hi> of <hi>Smetius, B.</hi> 5. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 17.) which he tells us that he received from <hi>Doct. Naevius;</hi> and that the truth of this Hiſtory was there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many of the Citizens. At <hi>Leipſwich</hi> little Girl not underſtanding what ſhe did by reaſon of her Childiſhneſs and want of Age, whilſt ſhe was imitating all the Actions carriage and behavior of her Nurſe (which ſhe had ſeen her oftentimes uſe in the raiſing of ſtorms and tempeſts) cauſeth thunder and Lightening, by which a village not far diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant from this City was ſet on fire. The little young Girl being brought before the Senate, it was there with much deliberation debated whether they might legally proceed againſt her. But it was decided by the opinions of all the Counſelors there preſent, that they could no way proceed againſt her, neither puniſh her, by reaſon of her nonage, and ignorance of what ſhe did. Which Hiſtory doth ſufficiently teach us that any one may even unwittingly, incautelouſly, and almoſt without his conſent, caſt himſelf into ſuch a like compact with the Devil. For when as the aforeſayd Girl (although by reaſon of her tender Age ſhe underſtood not what ſhe did) made uſe of thoſe Ceremonies that were delivered and preſcribed by the Devil unto the Witch her Nurſe; the Devil was preſently ready at hand, according to the Compact betwixt them) and ray ſed the aforeſaid Tempeſt. Which if any one of a riper age (which might eaſily underſtand, that in theſe kind of Ceremonies themſelves there can be no ſuch power and virtue) had done, ſuch a one (without doubt) had not been acquitted by the Counſellours, nor gone unpuniſhed by the Senate. And therefore we conclude that there is none (unleſs he be out of his wits) that wil make uſe of the means aforeſaid; ſeeing that he may eaſily underſtand that ſuch like Ceremonies, Words, and Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, do not perform thoſe things they are ſayd to do, either by any Natural power and virtue of their own, or elſe by any power given them from God, or the good Angells, but that they have this their power from that wicked ſpirit. And he whoſoever he be that ſhal make uſe of them cannot be acquitted and freed from groſs impiety, Magick, and Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>But whereas there are ſome that endeavor to derive theſe virtues from the Conſtellations;<note place="margin">Whether there be any virtue in the ſeals.</note> (and therefore teach how to make divers of theſe Seals under ſome certain poſition of Stars; we are therefore in the next place to examine that opinion alſo.</p>
                  <p>And the very truth is that among all the Seals of <hi>Arnoldus de villa Nova,</hi> and of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> (in his <hi>B. Archidox Magic.</hi>) there is none at all to be found that wil render a man inviolable, and ſo as not to be hurt by any kind of Weapons; and therefore this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil ſeemeth to be newer and ſince their times. But now in regard that there is one and the ſame reaſon for all thoſe aforeſaid effects (that are promiſed from theſe kind of Seals) we conceive it therefore very fit to ſpeak ſomething, in the General, touching the aforementioned Seals For if we ſhall (in the general) demonſtrate unto you, that theſe Seales have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no ſuch natural virtue or efficacy, we ſhall thereby withall ſhew unto you, that theſe ſeals likewiſe (that are made uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Wounds) have not their virtue and power from the Conſtellations.</p>
                  <p>That under the name of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy ſuch like Magical Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ſhould be expoſed to ſale,<note place="margin">Magick.</note> is no new thing; for it was of old thus wont to be done in the Eaſtern Countryes. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which <hi>Pliny (in the</hi> 30. <hi>B. of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory, and Chapt.</hi> 1.) <hi>ſayth thus. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick that moſt fraudulent of all the Arts hath very much prevayled all the world over, and that now of a long time, &amp; for theſe many Ages.
<pb n="2720" facs="tcp:49110:202"/> But indeed there is no cauſe why any ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at this the ſo great authority of Magick: in regard that ſhe alone of all the Arts, adding unto her ſelf and comprehending within her ſelf three other of the moſt famous and ſovereign of them (and ſuch as have the greateſt command upon the mind of Man) hath reduced them into one only, to wit, her ſelf alone. For firſt of all there is none that doubteth and that wil not readily grant, that ſhe hath her birth and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from Phyſick, and that ſhe ſo crept in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a fair and ſpecious pretence of ſafety and health, as a higher and more ſacred Art then Phyſick it ſelf. And ſo hath ſhe likewiſe by her blandiſhments and large admirable promiſes added unto her ſelf the ſtrength and power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; with which now a days mankind is ſo ſtrangely blinded. And that ſhe might the more eaſily ſuggeſt theſe her promiſes, ſhe intermingl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Mathematicall Arts; there being none that is not very greedily deſirous to know things future as concerning himſelf; verily believing that theſe things are fetcht and brought unto him from heaven it ſelf. And thus the ſenſes of Men being poſſeſſed, and lying under a threefold Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation hath increaſed and grown up unto ſo great a heighth, that even at this day it is very prevalent in moſt Nations; and in the Eaſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it hath a commanding power over ſuch Kings as have Kings for their ſubjects.</hi>

                  <p>The Reconciler (<hi>Difference</hi> 101) from that of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> (in his <hi>Centiloquy, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſublunaries are ſubject unto the Celeſtial Aſpects,</hi> that is to ſay, the ſpecies of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures of this inferior world are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Caeleſtial images,) concludeth and poſitively determineth, that the Caeleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſign <hi>Scorpio</hi> hath the predominance over al inferior Scorpions, and the Serpent over all Serpents here upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>But grant indeed that it be ſo, (which yet Nevertheleſs they have no way proved) that theſe inferior Earthly Scorpions are ſubject unto the ſign of the Scorpion in the Heavens; yet what is all this to the Scorpion carved and engraven upon the precious Stone? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Dog, or Scorpion, engraven or pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, is not of the ſame kind, nor under the ſame <hi>Genus,</hi> with the living Creature,
<pb n="2721" facs="tcp:49110:202"/> Dog, or Scorpion. There are others that ſay that this virtue is inſtilled into theſe Seals from Heaven and the Stars; and that the Aſtral Spirit that hath its influence and is ſent upon them, doth not only accommodate it ſelf unto thoſe Metals, precious Stones, and thoſe plants; but that it doth likewiſe ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intermingle it ſelf even with their very ſubſtance; and that in the very firſt Creation it obtained a Mutual and Sympathetical conſent with them, then a Familiarity, and Laſtly, ſoon after a Continuation alſo with them.</p>
                  <p>But let it indeed be granted, that the Heavens and the Stars do not only (as <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> will have it in this Queſt. <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>Diſputat. againſt Paracelſus, Page</hi> 151.) warm theſe inferior Bodies, and enlighten them, and that in this manner they do (as a Common and general cauſe) at all times produce one and the ſame effect in all things here below: but let it likewiſe be determined, that there are ſome certain peculiar Stars that work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe inferior Bodies by their ſecrets and occult influences, and that they do peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect thoſe things with which they have the aforeſaid familiarity; and that one Star hath a familiarity with the Adamant, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Roſe, and a third with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plant: But I pray, what maketh all this for the engraving and inſcribing of Figures and Characters, ſeeing that the Stars com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their virtues unto things here below in a meer Natural way, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript or Artifice of ours? And wherefore do not the Stars and Conſtellations infuſe thoſe their virtues equally and indifferently into Metals or precious Stones, whileſt they are whole and entire, and before they are engraven and inſcribed with any Characters, as they do afterwards (if theſe men ſpeak truth) into thoſe that have ſuch like Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters Carved and Engraven upon them? And certain it is, that <hi>Paeony</hi> gathered at ſuch a fit ſeaſon of the year, as alſo other Plants, and all things elſe whatſoever that are made uſe of inſtead of Natural Amulets, do put forth their virtues; (and ſo likewiſe the Load-ſtone draweth the Iron, and is moved unto the Pole) without any kinde of Figure, or Character engraven thereon. And hereupon <hi>Galen</hi> rightly determineth, that the <hi>Jaſper</hi> ſtone hath the very ſame virtues, whether the ſign of the Scorpion be carved upon it, yea or no.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Henricus Cornelius Agrippa</hi> ſeemeth to differ but very little from this opinion, who in his 1 <hi>B. of occult Philoſoph.</hi> and 33. <hi>Chap.</hi> thus writeth touching the thing in Controverſie: <hi>All the Stars</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have their own proper Natures, Proprieties, and Conditions; the Signs and Characters whereof they do by their Raies and Beams produce likewiſe even in theſe inferior Bodies, to wit, in the Elements, in pretious Stones, in Plants, in Animals, and their Members. Whereupon it is, that every thing whatſoever from its Harmonical diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and from its own Star Iradiating and Darting its Beams upon it, obtaineth ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Sign and Character imprinted upon it, that is ſignificative of that Star or Harmony; and containing ſome ſpecial virtue in it ſelf, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from others, either in general, or in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, or in the number of the matter praeexiſtent. Every thing therefore hath its own Character imprinted upon it (for the working of ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar effect by its own Star, and eſpecially by that which above all other things hath the ſovereign power and predominance over it: and theſe Characters contein within themſelves, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they likewiſe retein theſe proper Natures of their own Stars, as alſo their virtues and Roots, and they produce the like operations with them on other things upon which they are reflected: and they alſo draw forth and help forward the influences of their own Stars (whether Planets, or even fixed Stars alſo, and Celeſtial ſigns, and Images) to wit, as often as they are wrought and faſhioned in a due and fit matter, in their own due and proper time, and with due and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Solemnities.</hi> And there he alſo deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth very ſtrange and admirable letters and Characters, proper and peculiar unto each of the Planets. And therefore if any one deſire and ſeek after the virtues of any Star, the thing that is ſubject unto that Star is to be engraven upon ſomwhat that he wears about him. As for inſtance, if any one deſire to have the virtue and influence of the Sun, let him then take Gold and engrave upon it the Character of that Planet, at that very time when the virtues of the ſaid Planet are moſt ſtrong and vigorous. But theſe are all meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded upon a falſe ſuppoſition; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they take that for granted which indeed was never yet by us, neither will it ever be granted unto them. For firſt of al, <hi>Agrippa</hi> and others do attribute unto theſe Seals ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch like virtues (as we may ſee frequently in divers places of their Deſcriptions) which in very truth cannot be the Natural virtues of any Star. And <hi>Paracelſus</hi> (in the fourth <hi>B.</hi> of his <hi>Archidox. Magic.</hi>) teacheth us how we may make a Bodkin, and paint and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe upon it certain Characters; and then he affirmeth that if any one ſhal with Chalk make a circle againſt a wal, and in the very Centre thereof fix the ſayd Bodkin, all the flies neer that place wil come and ſit upon the ſayd Circle, and theſe remain until ſuch
<pb n="2722" facs="tcp:49110:203"/> time as the Bodkin ſhall be again pulled out of the Wall. But let <hi>Apella</hi> the Jew believe this, for indeed I ſhal not.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding there are at this day thoſe that do not only believe this, but endeavour likewiſe by their publique wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to perſwade others hereunto; and theſe conceive that this virtue is by thoſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters derived from the Conſtellations. But let them ſhew us what Star it is that hath this commanding power over theſe Flies. <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> is indeed called the god of Flies. And without all doubt theſe poor Flies are more likely to obey his Commands then the Stars. There is Another who tels us how we may make a Seal with the Figure of old Father <hi>Saturn</hi> digging up the Earth with a Spade (which, ſay they, ought to repreſent unto us the Planet <hi>Saturn;</hi>) and this Seal if any one ſhall carry about him in his left Boot, (and why not. I pray, as well in his right Boot, or on his Arm?) he writeth that it will then ſo preſerue a man, that he ſhall ſuffer no hurt at all from his Horſe; and moreover that it wil ſpeed and haſten the hard labor in Child-bearing Women.</p>
                  <p>And moreover how and from whence will they be able to prove that thoſe ſtrange and uncouth Characters (that are to be ſeen in <hi>Corn. Agrippa, Paracelſus,</hi> and others) are the Characters of certain Stars? And not Characters only, but even other Figures alſo. They paint <hi>Saturn</hi> in the likeneſs of an old man, with a Pruning Hook, Sythe, Spade, or Plow-ſhare. They paint or Picture <hi>Jupiter</hi> like a King with a Scepter in his Hand. Now what agreement is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe Figures and thoſe Planets which they Repreſent? And what, I pray, may the Reaſon be, that the Planets communicate their virtues and influences unto Metals, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they be engraven and inſcribed with theſe Figures, and not with others? And who was the firſt that taught us, that this Star taketh a delight in this kind of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and that Star in another kind of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter different from the former? And the Reaſon is the ſame for al other Figures; tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching all which they ought to prove unto us, that theſe are the Figures of certain Stars. And moreover, beſides theſe Characters, what mean they by ſo many Words, which they not only pronounce in the framing and faſhioning of theſe Seals, but they are likewiſe engraven and imprinted upon theſe Seals; as we may ſee in <hi>Paracelſ.</hi> his <hi>B. Archidox. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic.</hi> and in the Seals of <hi>Arnold. de villa Nova.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But others there are that endeavour to free themſelves, and clear the controverſie, by ſaying, that individuals when they begin to be under ſome determinate Conſtellation, they then receive a certain admirable facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (of operating, or of ſuffering) over and beſide that they have in ſpecial, or from the ſpecies. But let this be granted; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it cannot be ſaid, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone, or Metal, do then begin to have their being when they have theſe Characters engraven upon them; for they were, and had their being before; and indeed their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was likewiſe individual; and according alſo to their own opinion, the Aſtral Spirit &amp; virtue inſinuateth it ſelf into that ſubſtance wherewith it hath a Sympathy. For there is, to wit, between natural ſubſtances them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a certain occult and ſecret familiarity and Sympathy; but yet no ſuch thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Natural Subſtances and Artificial Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
                  <p>But others are of this opinion, that the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is not indeed the principle of operation, but yet notwithſtanding that it conduceth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much unto the ſaid operation. For the conception of a deformed Figure in the minde of Man or Woman, we ſee what ſadneſs it produceth unto them; and on the contrary what Joy and cheerfulneſs the conception of a fair and delightful Figure and repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cauſeth in their Minds and Countenances. And by the Inſtruments of Artificers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of the Figures, ſo are the operations various; ſome of them by the Saw, and ſome others of them by the Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet or Axe.</p>
                  <p>But neither is there any thing of weight or moment in this that they alleadg. For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, what Beauty or Deformity there is in theſe Images and Characters? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as fair things delight the minde while they are ſeen and lookt upon; how (I pray) can theſe things delight the mind of a Man when they are carried and worn about him covered and ſeldom look'd upon? And what do thoſe various Names, (and indeed oftentimes ſuch as are altogether unknown to us) confer and add unto the fair and pleaſant conception be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned? And as for the Inſtruments of Artificers, the Figure indeed maketh much unto the operations which are by a local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but nothing at all unto thoſe operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are wrought by alterations: for in theſe the Figure doth nothing at all, neither can it: and precious Stones if they have any natural virtues at al in them, they put forth theſe their virtues under any Figure whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be. And <hi>Galen</hi> writeth as touching the <hi>Jaſper</hi> ſtone, in the <hi>place above alleadged,</hi> that he himſelf had found by experience, that the virtue thereof was ſtil one and the ſame, with, or without the Figure of the Celeſtial Dragon, or the ſign <hi>Scorpio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="2723" facs="tcp:49110:203"/>
                  <p>Neither yet are there any other that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have been able to bring any the leaſt ſhew of probability for the virtues of theſe Characters and Seals. And how indeed could they poſſibly render any Reaſons, and give us the cauſes of ſuch their abſurd Tenets; whenas they write, that theſe Seals do not only expel and drive away Diſeaſes; but that ſome of them wil likewiſe make a Man graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto al Men whatſoever; and that others of them will procure for a man knowledg, Wit, and Memory; others the favour of Princes; others victory in War, and Civil Cauſes; others good fortune (as they cal it) in Hawking, Hunting, Fiſhing, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſing; and that others wil make friends to ſtand faithful unto them; others advance a Man unto the higheſt Honors and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that there are ſome of theſe Seals that wil make a Man Maſter of his with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be; and I know not what other things that theſe Seals are able to accompliſh for him that weareth them? <hi>Rodolphus Gocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> (the younger) taketh here a great deal of pains, and troubleth himſelf exceedingly (in his <hi>Magnetick Synarthroſis</hi>) and at length he diſtinguiſheth between theſe Seals; and thoſe whoſe Authors are ſaid to be <hi>Ragael, Chael, Terel, Hermes, Salomon,</hi> theſe he rejecteth: but there are others of them that he commendeth, to wit, thoſe Seals that are framed and faſhioned under ſome certain poſition and concourſe of the Stars, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive naturally all their virtues from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of theſe Stars, and from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and Continuation of the Natural Cauſes; without any impiety, or Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at al. But now what this Connexion of the Natural Cauſes is, and in what manner theſe Seals and Images receive their virtues from Heaven; theſe things he no where tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us; neither doth he ſufficiently explain himſelf; only he ſaith indeed that theſe things are very clear, and ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by Experiments. But the very ſame may be ſaid by <hi>Chael, Ragael,</hi> and the reſt of the Magitians, in the behalf and for the Juſtifying of their Seals alſo. And who is there that now adaies knoweth not, that even by ſuch like Seals very many have been made inviolable, and not to be hurt by any Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons? And therefore the Queſtion is not here, what may be done; but the Queſtion is only from what agent theſe things are performed; and whether by a Natural Cauſe, or by the aſſiſtance of the Evil Spirit.</p>
                  <p>But now unto any one that ſhal accurately and exactly and without any prejudice weigh and conſider the whole buſineſs, it wil very eaſily appear, that theſe vertues and effects cannot proceed from any Natural Cauſe. For two things there are in thoſe Seals, the matter it ſelf, and the Characters engraven upon it; unto neither of which this virtue can be aſcribed: for the matter is from Nature, and hath in it no ſuch virtues: and this they themſelves ſee a neceſſity of confeſſing.</p>
                  <p>And here therefore for the proving of the efficacy of theſe Seals, they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Amulets, and pretend the virtue of them. But be it ſo indeed, that all things whatſoever are written touching theſe Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets are true, (as moſt certain it is that very many of them are;) yet what is all this unto theſe Seals; in which if we conſider the Metals, Characters, and the like, it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, that thoſe things have in them no ſuch virtues. And <hi>Paeony,</hi> the <hi>Hoof</hi> of the Beaſt <hi>Alx,</hi> and the like, do ſhew and put forth thoſe virtues that they have, albeit there be no Characters at all engraven upon them: and the like alſo <hi>Galen</hi> (in <hi>the place before alleadged</hi>) tels us that he himſelf had by experience found to be true of the Jaſper-ſtone.</p>
                  <p>And then as theſe Seals have not their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from the matter; ſo neither from the Characters, that are from the Artificer; and cannot have any ſuch virtues, either from the Artificer, or from themſelves. For why, theſe Characters are from an Idea in the minde of the Artificer, which doth not work any effect upon things external, And of themſelves they are nothing elſe but Figures. But now there is no power nor efficacy at all in Figures for the working any effect, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they are nothing elſe but only qualities of a quantity. For all virtue and power of acting is principally from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; which by its qualities is efficacious and operative. Action is between Contraries of the ſame kinde, and ſuch are not Natural and Artificial; among which are theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. Neither do things Artificial work upon things Natutal, nor alter or affect them as they are ſuch: but they Act and work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as they have a Natural matter. And ſo on the contrary, things Natural do not Act upon Artificial things (by altering or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting them) as ſuch, but as they conſiſt of a Natural matter. And therefore Images or Names engraven upon matter can of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perform nothing; and the matter if it be at all affected by the Heavens, is equally and as much affected if it hath not any Image or Figure at all engraven upon it: and as for Characters, Figures, and Words, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon the mater, they have in them no peculiar virtue of receiving the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Caeleſtial Bodies; neither can
<pb n="2724" facs="tcp:49110:204"/> they give any ſuch virtue unto the Matter.</p>
                  <p>The truth is that <hi>Rodolphus Goclenius</hi> the younger doth indeed endeavour to give an Anſwer unto this objection; whileſt (in his <hi>Magnetick Synarthroſis, page</hi> 101.) he thus writeth: <hi>It is not the Statue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as a Statue, neither yet the Seal, nor the Image and figure, as ſuch, that can affect any other Statue or quality. For the very truth is, that theſe Artificial Seals do acquire no virtue at al from Art; but the virtue is inſtilled and infuſed into them from Heaven, and the Stars. I ſay again that this ſame Celeſtial Ray, and Aſtral ſpirit that is ſent down hither, and here hath its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, (in this ſublunary world) doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Accomodate it ſelf unto the Metalls, Stones, and thoſe plants aforeſaid; but doth likewiſe ſecretly and imperciptibly inſinuate it ſelf into their very ſubſtance; with the which (even from the very firſt Creation) it hath obtained a Mutual and ſympathetick familiarity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, and continuation. But now this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath its influence without any adjuration, Conſecration, and invocation of Devills; but altogether in a Natural way.</hi> But all that he anſwereth is nothing worth. For this is that very thing (according as it is in the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) which he ought to prove, to wit, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Metals, and papers, ignorantly engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Lettered, there can any ſuch like virtue (as is attributed unto theſe Seals) be derived from heaven, and the Stars. For although we do not deny, that the Stars have their ſecret influences upon theſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bodies (and therefore he hath taken much pains to very little purpoſe in proving of it,) to wit, that the Stars do act upon theſe inferior bodies not only by their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and light, but alſo by their occult influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: yet nevertheleſs, two things there are eſpecially of which there is great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made. The firſt is this, whether the Stars have in them any ſuch virtue of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing fortuitous Events, and meer caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſuch effects as are not Natural but wholly depend upon the will and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Men. And the other is this, to wit, why they do not communicate thoſe their influential virtues unto Metalls as they are of themſelves, but only unto ſuch of them as are engraven with Characters. For what have thoſe Characters to do with the Stars? And what hath <hi>Mars</hi> in the Heavens to do with the image of an Armed man? Or what hath <hi>Saturn</hi> to do with an old man holding the plough? And ſo of all other the Planets.</p>
                  <p>And the very ſame is likewiſe to be ſayd (the caſe ſtanding al one) touching the ſigns of the Zodiack, and the reſt of the Aſteriſms unto which Names, have been given by Men according to their wills and pleaſure; (for the teaching and inſtructing of others in the grounds of Aſtronomy) who could (if they had ſo pleaſed) have given ſome other names unto thoſe Aſteriſms, which we now from them call, <hi>Piſces,</hi> or <hi>Sagitarius.</hi> Like as the Hollanders, even in our Age, have moſt freely (and according as they thought good) impoſed names upon all thoſe Meridional ſigns that they obſerved in their Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Southerly parts. And ſo the ſigns and figures likewiſe (denoting thoſe Aſteriſms,) have been impoſed according to the wills and fancies of Men: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conclude, that there is no Neceſſity at all why the virtue of any Star ſhould inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate it ſelf into any ſuch Character as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed meerly by the wil and fancie of Men, although it be engraven and inſcribed at ſuch a certain time, the Star being then in ſuch or ſuch a poſition.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the whole controverſy at length returns to this, that from a Naturall Cauſe there can no ſuch virtue be aſcribed unto Seals and ſuch like Characters: and if there be any, (for of this very thing there is great doubt to be made; and many things without queſtion are much talked of and boaſted, which indeed were never yet expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally found to be true) as <hi>Paracelſus, Arnoldus de villa Nova, Thurneiſerus,</hi> (and other of our more Modern Authors) produce many things to this purpoſe; I ſay if any ſuch efficacy be found in them, it is to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed either to the imagination, (for there is none that knoweth not, that the power and ſtrength of the Imagination is very great and almoſt incredible) or elſe if it be not ſo; then of neceſſity it muſt depend upon ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural cauſe; that is to ſay indeed upon wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſpirits, who by ſuch like Characters, as by certain ſignes, are tacitly invited and called unto, by virtue of a former Compact they had long before entered into with his Servants that engaged themſelves in a League with him. For theſe things have their original from the Gentiles that were extremely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſuperſtition and Idolatry: and thoſe wicked ſpirits made and framed unto themſelves ſuch like Seals, and Characters, to ſerve inſtead of Military pawns and pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And therefore they avayl from that Compact (whether explicite or implicite) to wit, that which the Devil entered into with that perſon who firſt received and ſuckt in this Diſcipline from him. Now the Devil doth this, to confirm and eſtabliſh the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, and the ſuperſtitions conſtituted by himſelf; and that he may ingraft them into the minds of Men; or elſe being ingrafted that he might confirm and propagate the ſame; and ſo by this, as by all other means, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="2725" facs="tcp:49110:204"/> man and hurry him away (unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) from God his creatour, and from thoſe Means by him created, and ordayned for the ſafety and welfare of Mankind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe things (and al other of this nature) are nothing elſe but certain owls or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills Night-birds, with which he uſeth to hawk for the ſouls of Mankind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is by no means to be endured, what <hi>Phedro</hi> writeth (in his <hi>Chirurgia minore</hi>) that in ſuch Characteriſtick Cures there lie concealed greater and more miraculous Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Firſt Fathers and the Ancient Prophets, then is fit for us to expreſs and diſcover unto others. The raſh bold Man ought firſt of all to have demonſtrated that this ſo great a virtue is either by God and Nature, or elſe by Art, put upon theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and conſtellated words (as he calls them;) then ſo to have raged and railed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other Phyſitians, terming them (as he doth) blaſphemous, and men of an ill conſcience, ſo to detract the honour from God in theſe his higheſt and miraculous ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Characteriſtick Cure. He honoreth God who contemplateth, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and Celebrateth the works of God, ſuch as are by him created, and as they come forth of his hands. And he may truly be ſayd to be injurious againſt God, and impious, who attributeth unto any of his Creatures thoſe virtues which they have neither received from God, nor yet from Art.</p>
                  <p>And as for thoſe firſt Fathers, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophets he ſpeaks of, who (as he writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) uſed this Characteriſtick Cure, they are not thoſe of whom we find menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made in holy writ; for it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any Argument that theſe ever admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any ſuch ſuperſtitious practiſes: but they are thoſe that we find mention made of in <hi>Aſcelpius Hermes Treſmegiſtus,</hi> in theſe words <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that our Fore-fathers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much againſt, and walked contrary unto the command of the Gods, (incredulous as they were) and not heeding Divine worſhip, but ſleighting true Piety and Religion, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented an Art by which they might have Gods unto themſelves; unto which when they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it they adjoyned that fit and convenient virtue that proceedeth from the very ſoul of the World, and this they mingled with the ſaid Art. And becauſe they were not able to make Souls, calling forth the Souls of Devills, or Angels, they conferred theſe upon their Images, and their Divine Myſteryes; by which theſe their Idols alone might have power and might of doing good or doing Evil unto others, as they thought good.</hi> And al others who have approved of thoſe Characters, &amp; defended them have been very much addicted unto the damnable art Magick, and unto all kind of ſuperſtitious practiſes; to wit, the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> (the moſt Studious &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Worſhippers of Devills) <hi>Cornelius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa, Paracelſus,</hi> and others the like, very much ſuſpected as touching this infamous Magick. Neither doth this any thing avail them, to ſay, that ſuch things as theſe may be done, without any invocation upon the Devil, and adjuration of the Wicked ſpirits, and by other unlawful Means; and that they may be wrought by a Natural power. For firſt of all they were to prove that theſe have within them thoſe peculiar virtues that Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls and precious ſtones of themſelves have not; which unleſs they can prove we may truly conclude that they make uſe of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means, and ſuch as were never ordayned by God, nor propounded by Nature for our practiſe. And moreover, though there appear no immediate compact with the Devil, nor any explicite Conjuration, at the preſent; yet Nevertheleſs there may be for all this (and queſtionleſs there is) an implicite compact with the Devil; who very well knows and is ready to acknowledg thoſe his pawns and engagements (as it were) once given and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto his followers and Worſhippers. And who is there of all theſe who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend theſe Seals from the ſuſpition of all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Idolatry, that can explain unto us what theſe ſtrange and wonderful Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (and as <hi>Apul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Magic.</hi> &amp; elſewhere) ſignify; or that dares paſs his word, and engage his faith upon it, that theſe figures and unkown words are not the Devils pawns and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances by which he obligeth unto himſelf his worſhippers and votaries? A German under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not what is written in the Turkiſh Language, but a Turk doth; as likewiſe neither doth a Turk underſtand that which is written in the German tongue, which yet a German doth. And ſo although it be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that underſtandeth theſe ſtrange uncouth Characters, or knoweth what to make of thoſe never heard of words (not to be underſtood) yet notwithſtanding, the Devil (as the Author of that Alphabet and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) underſtands them very well; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly being by theſe invocated, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon for his aſſiſtance, he readily afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame unto the utmoſt of his power. And therefore, let any who ſo pleaſeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of theſe waies &amp; practiſes, &amp; account of them as highly as he liſteth; but as for my own part, I ſhall endeavour to keep in mind that firſt and Chief command of God; to wit, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods.</hi>

                  <p>And therefore ſeeing that from what hath been ſaid is clearly appeareth that there are no Natural virtues in theſe Seals and <hi>Periap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> it is even from hence manifeſt, that theſe things cannot poſſibly render a man inviol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ſo as not to be hurt by any Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of War: and for this cauſe we have been the more large in the handling of this Controverſie; and at length conclude with this, that whatſoever is attributed unto them they have it not either from Heaven, or from any other Natural Cauſe, but that all this is nothing elſe but the meer invention of the Devil; and that therefore it cannot be made uſe of without Idolatry. For God ſo formed and fram'd the Body of Man, that it ſhould be ſoft, and ſenſible of pain, and the ſolution of Unity; and therefore whoſoever he be that would diſpoſe and make it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he oppoſeth himſelf unto Gods order and intention, and uſeth the Devils help and aſſiſtance therein. For the Cauſe of this effect is altogether to be referred, either unto Nature, or unto God, or unto Men, or unto thoſe means that are adminiſtred; or elſe Laſtly, it is to be aſcribed unto the Devil. Unto Nature it cannot be referred; for ſhe hath formed unto Man ſuch a Body, that it may be violated by any kind of Weapons. Neither can this effect be attributed unto God, who without a Miracle doth not change the order and courſe of Nature. Neither doth it appear from Scripture, or any ſacred Hiſtory, that ever any ſuch thing was done by God: although that (by his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) his people have oftentimes waged moſt dangerous and difficult Wars againſt divers of their and his enemies. Neither can any ſuch effect proceed from Men, who (as it is very well known) have no power as of themſelves to perform any ſuch thing. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewiſe, if we conſider thoſe means, have they any power in them any way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to produce ſuch an effect, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the order of Nature. For they are either Characters, or words, or ſome ſuch like thing, unto which no ſuch virtues were every yet given and granted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by God, or elſe by Nature. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cometh al (at length) to this, that ſuch things as theſe are performed by the help and aſſiſtance of the Devil. For albeit there are many who think that there paſſeth no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce at al betwixt them and the Devil, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſhall make uſe of ſuch means: yet notwithſtanding theſe ought to know, that ſuch means as they (firſt of all) have no warrant from God, ſo neither were they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Men, but ſuggeſted unto thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (even by the Devil himſelf) who at firſt entered into a league and Covenant with him; and therefore they are to know, that all thoſe that make uſe of them do make themſelves partakers of this compact, as we have often ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>And that the evil and wicked Spirit doth meerly Cheat and delude men by theſe <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apta</hi> appeareth even by this, that when men have thought themſelves by this means, and in this manner, ſufficiently fenced and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt the violence of all kind of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; there were others found that were able to Nul, Diſſolve, and quite take away that inviolability, as they term it, and proof againſt the force of Weapons; and ſo when they leaſt of all look for or ſuſpect any ſuch thing, they periſh in this their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And the truth is, the waies they have to uncharm the Body, and to render it penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Weapons or Gun-ſhot, are for the moſt part (as they ſay) of very little weight or moment; but they are (I confeſs) unto me altogether unknown: and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Relation of others (of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar people) it plainly appeareth that thoſe <hi>Periapta</hi> have no power of fencing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Body againſt bullets of Silver; as alſo that a mans Body cannot be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, if the Leaden bullet be but never ſo little chawed in the mouth: if the Swords point be heated in the Fire, and then anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Sewet; if the Sword be run into the ground, or thruſt into broad; and if many other ſuch like things be done; in which to be curious is neither my buſineſs, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. But this will moſt certainly from hence appear, that the Devil is a Lyar, and that he keepeth not the Covenant and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact he entereth into with his Servants; but that he oftentimes Cheateth and Deceiveth them; and that when he communicateth that Art unto Men, he doth not this that he may benefit them; but only layeth Snares for their Souls, whileſt he moſt of al pretendeth and promiſeth the making of their Bodies ſafe from all manner of injuries. Of which there are extant many inſtances and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and among the reſt, remarkable is that example which happened at <hi>Miſnia</hi> in the Moneth of <hi>February,</hi> this very year 1634. For there (at <hi>Miſnia</hi>) when as a certain Souldier (in his Cups) was boaſting and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his brags (with that ſolem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but yet now adaies too common an adjuration among the Souldiers, <hi>Let the Devil fetch me,</hi> or, <hi>the Devil take me</hi>) that he was inviolable, and impenetrable by any Weapons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and that he might give them an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to confirm the truch of what he had ſaid drew forth a ſhort Sword, and therewith he violently ſmote twice upon his naked
<pb n="2727" facs="tcp:49110:205"/> Breaſt, (inſomuch that the Sword was even bowed and made crooked thereby) and yet had no hurt at all by thus doing; but when he attempted to do the ſame the third time, then the Sword ſuddenly penetrated into his Breaſt, and pierced even unto his very heart; and ſo this miſerable wretch periſhed in this miſerable manner.</p>
                  <p>And therefore let every Chriſtian and pious Souldier be hereof warned that he make not uſe of any ſuch wicked and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means (as being and proceeding meerly from the Devil) but that he content himſelf in the ſafe guarding of his Body by lawful Arts and waies; and as for all other things, let him commit them unto almighty God, who hath our lives in his Hands; and without whoſe will there is not one hair can fal from our Heads.</p>

                  <p>THat which in a ſoft part is called a Wound, the ſame is in a hard part, and bone, called a <hi>Fracture,</hi> (by the Greeks properly termed <hi>Agma,</hi> and <hi>Catagma</hi>) which is a diviſion or rupture of the bone, from ſome external Cauſe violently ruſhing and breaking in upon it. Now as for thoſe that have written at large and very accurately touching Fractures, they are (in the firſt place, and eſpecially) <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his <hi>Book of Fractures;</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon the ſaid Book; and in his <hi>ſixth Book</hi> of the <hi>Meth. of Curing, Chap.</hi> 5. and 6. And among the more modern Authors, and thoſe of our own time, <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente,</hi> in his <hi>B. of Chirurgery, Tit. of the Fractures of the Bones;</hi> and theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors you may have recourſe unto, for your more ful ſatisfaction in ſo weighty a point: in the mean time I ſhal endeavour briefly and plainly to Contract the whole ſubſtance of the ſubject in Hand, and ſo to ſet it before you.</p>
                  <div type="differences">
                     <head>The Differences.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> (in his <hi>ſixth B. of the Meth. of Curing, and</hi> 5. <hi>Chapt.</hi>) telleth us what theſe Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are. For ſomtimes (ſaith he) the bones are broken tranſverſly; and then it is chiefly and properly to be termed a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; but then indeed if the bones be ſo broken, that by no Art or means that can be uſed the ends and extreme parts of them may be brought and made to ſtick faſt together as before, and that they lie not directly one againſt the other, this kind of Fracture is (in ſpecial) called <hi>Cauludon</hi> from the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and likeneſs that it hath with a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſtalk. And <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> writeth that this <hi>Cauludon Catagma</hi> is likewiſe called <hi>Raphanedon,</hi> and <hi>Sicnedon,</hi> from the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a broken Raddiſh and Cucumber. But if the bone be not only broken into two parts, but that it be likewiſe ſhivered into many, that Fracture is termed <hi>Suntrimma,</hi> or <hi>Comminution;</hi> and by <hi>Galen</hi> it is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Caruedon,</hi> becauſe that it is made after the manner of broken Nut-ſhels. But if the bones be cleft according to their length like as Wood is cleft, it is then called <hi>Parameces,</hi> that is to ſay, (properly) a right or ſtraight <hi>Fiſſure</hi> or Cleft; and by <hi>Galen</hi> it is termed <hi>Schidacedon.</hi> In the Head, this ſpecies of the ſolution of Unity hath names peculiar and proper unto it; touching which ſee <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> in his <hi>B.</hi> of the <hi>Wounds of the Head,</hi> and in his <hi>firſt B.</hi> of <hi>Practiſe, Part</hi> 1. <hi>Chap</hi> 23.</p>
                     <p>And of theſe Fractures there are likewiſe ſeveral other differences; for ſome of them are great, and ſome again but ſmal Fractures, ſome of them ſimple or ſingle Fractures, and all but one alone; but then another Fracture there is that is manifold; as conſiſting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; ſome equal, others unequal; and the bones are alſo broken ſomtimes in one manner, and ſomtimes in another manner, and that very different. And the truth is, the Ancients gave them their names from the Figure and the likeneſs of other parts; and (as we told you before) they called them <hi>Cauledon, Raphanedon, Sicnedon Catagma;</hi> and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times likewiſe <hi>Alphitedon,</hi> when the bone is broken and ſhattered into many ſmal and thin parrs, <hi>not unlike unto Meal;</hi> they cal another ſort of Fracture alſo <hi>Calamedon,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>breaking of a Reed, eis Onucha, after the form of a Nayl.</hi> All which Appellations notwithſtanding are for the moſt part ſleighted and neglected by <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who inſtead of them hath made uſe of
<pb n="2728" facs="tcp:49110:206"/> Names more ordinary and uſual, as one ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſirous to interpret, and chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſpeaking of them in more words, ſo to deſcribe them. And ſomtimes al the parts of the broken bone do again Joyn and grow together; but ſomtimes ſome one or other parts of the broken bone impoſtumateth and droppeth out.</p>
                     <p>There are likewiſe divers other differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that are taken from the part affected. For one is ſaid to be a Fracture of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; another of the Arm, another of the Thigh; and ſo of the other parts. And then indeed in the Arm, either but one of the two bones, or elſe both of them (to wit, the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and the <hi>Radius,</hi> bones) are broken. And in like manner it is alſo in the Thigh, the caſe being one and the ſame. The bones of the Noſe are likewiſe broken; and ſo are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Channel bones, the Ribbs, and the whirl-bone.</p>
                     <p>And there are moreover (beſides theſe) other differences that are meerly accidental; when as a bone broken either abideth ſtil in its own place, or elſe is carried forth thereof, and lifted above ſome other bone; and that ſomtimes the Fracture is but newly made, and ſomtimes it is old, and of a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. And there are alſo other differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that are improperly ſo called; as that a Fracture is conjoyned ſomtimes with a Wound, ſomtimes with a Luxation or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynting, and ſomtimes with other affects. For ſomtimes there is a Fracture made, the Skin and Fleſh lying above it ſtil remaining ſound and whole; and ſomtimes theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen likewiſe to be hurt and wounded. And ſomtimes alſo together with the Fracture there happeneth a looſening of the Joynt neer unto it. And ſomtimes unto a Fracture there happen an extraordinary pain, a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and an Inflammation: but ſomtimes again, there are none of al theſe joyned with, or following upon the Fracture.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>Now all things may be ſaid to break the bones, that ſo endeavour to bow and bend them, that they (being not flexible) muſt neceſſarily be broken. <hi>Galen</hi> (in his <hi>ſecond B.</hi> of <hi>Fractures,</hi> and <hi>Text</hi> 9.) reduceth them all unto four Cauſes, whiles he writeth after this manner: <hi>It is either ſomthing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that can bruiſe and batter, if it be laid on with great force and violence (and this without doubt ought to be ſome Body that is hard of ſubſtance, and heavy in its weight:) or elſe it is ſomwhat that doth not only divide the Skin, or that divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth likewiſe ſomthing that lieth under the Skin, even unto the very bones, but which divideth alſo the very bones themſelves: which Malady</hi> Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates <hi>himſelf indeed calleth</hi> Edra, (<hi>that is to ſay, a</hi> Deceſſion) <hi>in his</hi> B. of the Wounds of the Head. <hi>And moreover alſo ſome by leaping from an high place have broken either the Ankle or the Thigh bone; which in theſe perſons were drier, and not ſo thick perhaps as in others. For I my ſelf alſo have ſeen in the common wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when in the turning of a man round a Fracture hath happened unto him, who having hereby had his Ankle together with the Calf of his Leg broken by the greatneſs of the Wound the bones have been made naked and bare. For this Fracture happened upon his Ankles being gotten under the Leg of his Adverſary that wraſtled with him, in a tranſverſe or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart manner; ſo that both the Heads thereof, as well that toward the Foot, as that above toward the Knee, were preſſed downward with great violence: like as we alſo ſee it in Wood, which we our ſelves endeavour by bowing and bending it round to break. For if a piece of Wood be put upon ones Thigh, and then from both ends or Heads preſſed down vehemently with the Hands, we ſhal then ſoon perceive it to be broken in the middle part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet notwithſtanding even the very Conſtitution of the bones doth ſomtimes cauſe the Fracture of the bones; the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of them being ſomtimes ſo brittle, that it cannot brook the leaſt violence; and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again more hard; ſo that it cannot be broken but with a far greater violence and force. And rottenneſs likewiſe rendereth the bones very frail and weak, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which followeth the French Pox, and in thoſe that often make uſe of Mercurial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unctions. Of this ſtrange and wonderful frailty and weakneſs in the bones there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Memorable Hiſtory in <hi>Marcellus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> in his <hi>Hiſt. Medic. Mirabil. B</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. And the ſtory is briefly this: Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Morellus, <hi>Coach-man unto that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Poet, and Noble Patrician, D.</hi> Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius de Pietis, <hi>ſporting, and playing the wag with others of his fellow Servants, ſnatcht up half an Orange from off the Table, and threw it as hard as he could at the Head of his fellow Servant running before him; but as it fel out, he did himſelf more miſchief then the other. For in that Arm wherewith he threw (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſtrong and forcible motion) the bone of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> right Shoulder was ſo broken, that the Heads of the broken bone being disjoyned one from the other, were eaſily and manifeſtly found to be ſo even by the touch. But ſtrange it is to hear what followed. This bone was no ſooner ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and bolſtered up with Iron plates (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that he could not now do his buſineſs as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) but at midnight lying in his bed, and awakening, he puts down the other Arm to reach himſelf the Chamber pot: in which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="2729" facs="tcp:49110:206"/> the bone of the left Arm was broken about the middle of it; and this was likewiſe ſet and bound up by the help of the Phyſitian. This Man for many yeers before had been ſore troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the French Pox in a moſt grievous manner; in ſo much that his Head, Legs, and Arms were ful of hard knotty ſwellings, which at length by his often anoynting them with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents of Hydrarge, ſeemed to ſink down and diſappear. Wherefore we can think no other, but that the rottenneſs eating through the bones of the Arm, and thereby vitiating and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, made way and gave occaſion for this ſo eaſie and much to be admired Fracture.</hi> Two Hiſtories Paralel to this we meet with in <hi>Schenckius</hi> (in his 5. <hi>B.</hi> and 8. <hi>Obſervat.</hi>) from the obſervation of D. <hi>Camerarius.</hi> For <hi>Capivaccius</hi> had ſomtime related unto him, that a certain perſon in throwing an Almond ſhel againſt the pavement, inſtead of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that, brake his Arm. As likewiſe he related of another, that but knocking ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with a Mallet, (and that not very hard neither) brake his Arm likewiſe. Two other ſuch Hiſtories we meet with in <hi>Guilhelm. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius,</hi> in the 2 <hi>Century of his Obſervations.</hi> The firſt is of <hi>Philibert Sarrazenus</hi> (a Phyſitian of <hi>Leyden</hi>) who writeth unto <hi>Fabricius (Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat.</hi> 66.) in this manner: <hi>A certain man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Citizen of Leyden (threeſcore yeers of Age) was tortured with an obtuſe and dull pain (for the ſpace of almoſt two moneths) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a Flegmatick Gout in the Joynts of his Shoulder and right Arm. Remedies he uſed none all this while: only he procured what reſt he could for that part, by having the Arm affected wrapt up in a Swathe, and continually reſting upon his Breaſt. He being otherwiſe very ſound and healthy, about eight of the Clock in the morning goeth forth abroad unto the ſhops; and while he was fitting on a Glove up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hand of the right Arm, (and that as gently as he could) he brake the bone of his Arm (tranſverſly or overthwart) four or five Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers below the Shoulder. I being ſent for went immediatly unto him, and there I beheld the whole buſineſs as it was, not without very great admiration; I ſearched the Arm and Shoulder; and by a Chirurgeon I reſtored the bone unto his former place, and commanded that convenient Remedies ſhould be adminiſtred, and applied unto the part affected. After three daies I went again to viſit this Patient, that I might ſearch and find whether or no all things had been rightly ordered and applied. And having removed the Swath-bands and the Splinters, we ſaw that the bone was returned unto its Natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Scituation; and we ſoon perceived it to be ſo by preſſing down our Fingers upon the place. But Lo, a little below this, about the Joynt of the Elbow, a new Fracture of the ſame bone (which as yet we had not ſeen) offered it ſelf unto our view; very ſad and grievous pains excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate the Patient; and therefore we again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our ſelves with all diligence unto our work, and endeavour again the reſtoring of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bone unto its proper place. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which al things ſucceeded well, and the pains were all calmed, inſomuch that now he taketh very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable reſt: but yet nevertheleſs, from that time forward the Swaths were never unfolded; neither was he ever ſeen (hitherto) to make any uſe of that part. And that which made me ſo much to admire the ſtrange and wonderful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted frailty and brittleneſs of the bones in this Perſon, was this, that he altogether denied that he had been at any time troubled with any affects of the bones, contracted either from the foul Diſeaſe, or from any other cauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other Hiſtory we find in the <hi>ſixty eighth</hi> of his <hi>Obſervations,</hi> in theſe very words: <hi>Philibert Brachlea</hi> (of <hi>Sequſium) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in the fifty nineth yeer of her Age, of her own accord and without any manner of violence externally offered unto her by any whomſoever had her bones broken, ſo that ſhe died thereof, in the yeer</hi> 1606. <hi>This Woman whiles on the Lords day (which it ſeems accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rite and Cuſton of the Country was held more ſacred then ordinary) ſhe was in the morning putting on a new Smock petticoat, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up her Body as ſhe lay in her bed, and her Hands ſtretched forth above her Head, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (by the great pain ſhe felt on the ſudden) that ſhe had not only diſlocated, but broken the bone of one of her Arms; ſo that there was need of the Chirurgeous help: who when he had fitly put together the extreme parts and ends of the broken bones, and bound them up with Swaths, he moreover outwardly adminiſtred fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies, and ſo at length had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Cure that affect. But this miſerable and unfortunate Woman was no ſooner freed from theſe ſtreights, but ſhe muſt yet again fal into a worſe miſchance, and undergo the violence and grief of a greater Malady. For when as at laſt (after that ſhe had now a long time kept her bed) ſhe deſired to be raiſed up out of it by the help of her houſ-hold Servants; before ſhe went to the Fire ſide, her Maid that then waited upon her in putting on her Stockings, (ſo ſoon as ever ſhe had but endeavoured it) only laying on her Hands to help her Miſtreſs, brake the bone of her right Leg in a tranſverſe overthwart man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which the Chirurgeon again repaired. In theſe troubles and griefs the poor miſerable Woman lived for the ſpace of two yeers; and having al this two yeers time been troubled with divers Fractures, and innumerable pains from day to day) ſhe had at length her life ſhortened and taken away by them.</hi> And the Author of this Obſervation writeth, that the ſtrange
<pb n="2730" facs="tcp:49110:207"/> and much to be admired fractures in this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were not cauſed either by the French Pox, or from any other Diſeaſes, ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not been at any time affected with the one or the other; nor ever in all her life troubled with any ſuch ſickneſs. But his conjecture is, that the true cauſe hereof was ſome occult and ſecret poyſon, proceeding from ſome extraordinary and notable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of the humors; which up and down, on al ſides paſſing throw the whole ſubſtance of the bones corrupted it in this ſtrange and unexpreſſible manner.</p>

                     <p>A Tranſverſe fracture, or that which is made in an oblique manner may eaſily be known, becauſe that by the very touch the extremityes of the broken bone (being now ſeparated) are ſoon diſcovered; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the place of the fracture there is found a Cavity, or hollowneſs that is not Natural. And moreover the body, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the broken Member cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after the due and wonted manner. And there ariſeth likewiſe, before the bones be ſet and brought together again into their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, an extreme and moſt intollerable pain, whiles that the extremities of the broken bone prick and grate upon the parts nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, being very quick of ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Which that it may be the more rightly known, the member that is ſound is to be compared (as Arm with Arm, Leg with Leg) with that that is broken. And very often alſo it ſo falls out that by reaſon of a broken bone the Member is made ſhorter then it ſhould be, whileſt the Muſcles draw up the inferior part of the bone. And for the moſt part likewiſe fractures are generally and commonly well known; ſome violent cauſes (having power enough to break the bones) uſually preceding. But then thoſe fractures that are made longwayes in the bone, are not to be known but with more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty: and yet notwithſtanding they may be diſcovered from the preternatural thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Member, as alſo from the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and pain thereof.</p>
                     <p>The bones oftentimes likewiſe impoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and drop forth, to wit, when all their ſmall parts and little pieces could not be brought back and ſet in their proper places, and thereupon are left deſtitute and naked of fleſh: and this is known by the blackneſs of the bone, (if at leaſt it lie open unto the view) or elſe by the ſtirring and moving up and down of the bone, if it be found not to adhere and ſtick cloſe unto the other bones.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The fracture of the bones made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the length of them is more eaſily cured then that fracture that is made either in an oblique, or in a tranſverſe manner. For there is no ſuch need of any laborious repla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the bones; but it is ſufficient, if the bones (gaping as it were) be again Joyned cloſe together.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Among the Tranſverſe and oblique fractures, that is moſt eaſily Cured (and hath leaſt of danger in it) that is ſingle or ſimple, and equal; and in which the broken bones are not at al moved out of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe fractures in which the heads of the broken bones are retuſe and blunt have but little of danger in them: but when they are ſharp-pointed, thoſe fractures are the worſt and moſt dangerous of any; inre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they are not eaſily to be ſet cloſe together (as having nothing of any blunt bone to reſt upon) and becauſe they alſo hurt and wound the fleſh, and ſomtimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Nerve or Muſcle, as <hi>Celſus</hi> tells us in his fifth Book, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fracture is then very difficult to be cured, when the bone is divided into many fragments; and the more the ſmal pieces are, ſtill the more difficult is the Cure like to prove: and ſo alſo when there are ſharp pointed ſtickings out, which prick and wound the parts that lye neer unto them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. By how much the greater the fracture is, and by how much the greater alſo the broken bones are, with ſo much the more difficulty and ſlowneſs is the fracture Cured.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When two bones Joyned together (as in the Arm, the <hi>Radius</hi> and the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna;</hi> in the Leg, the Ankle and the <hi>Fibula</hi>) are both of them broken, the Cure will be more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult then if only one of theſe be broken. For if one of theſe bones remain whole and unbroken the Muſcles cannot then ſo eaſily be contracted, as being kept ſtretched out by the unbroken bone. And ſo likewiſe when the broken bone is ſet again in its former place, if the other be whole, that ſerveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a prop unto that which is broken; and a greater help and benefit it is unto it, then are either the ſwathes or the ſplinters, or both of them together. But on the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if they be both broken, al things that are performed in the keeping in its place the bone after it is ſet muſt be done with far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Care, curioſity, and pains-taking.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Fracture that is made in the middle of the bone is to be accounted lighter, and leſs dangerous then that which is nigher un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head of the bone, whether it be the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="2731" facs="tcp:49110:207"/> or the inferior head. For whereas nigh unto the lower head there are many Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and neer unto the upper head very many Nerves; the greater are the pains that are excited; and the Cure is rendered ſo much the more difficult. But if the fracture be nigh unto the Joynt, it is then the moſt dangerous of any, in regard that there are in that place both Tendons, and Nerves, and Ligaaments; and becauſe that the broken part cannot there be ſo conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bound up; and becauſe alſo, in this bloodleſs and cold place the heat is but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak. And albeit that the fracture may in that place be conſolidated; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it leaveth behind it a great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the motion of that Member, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Callus</hi> which bindeth (as it were) the Tendons or Muſcles.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. A new fracture is very apt and ready to be conſolidated. But if there be any time delayed, the Cure is thereby altogether ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the more difficult; not only becauſe that upon the happening of the inflammation that extenſion of the part (which is required) cannot be performed without much danger; but likewiſe becauſe that the extremities of the bones become hardned, ſo that they can never after this be brought to Joyn and grow together again; and this more eſpecially happeneth in aged perſons. And there fore we muſt endeavour all we can that as ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as may be, the Extremities of the bones may be fitted and Joyned together the one to the other; for ſo by this means they wil afterward the more eaſily grow together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: for be it how it will, if ſo be that pain and an Inflammation happen upon the frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they render the Cure the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If in a fracture of ſome one of the more eminent bones the fit and Convenient Cure thereof be protracted and put off beyond the ſeventh day; there wil then be danger leſt that ſomething of the bones be be nummed &amp; impoſtumated; as <hi>Galen</hi> tells us, in his third Book of <hi>Fractures Text.</hi> 37.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And ſo likewiſe if there be a Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fleſh, and a wound Joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Fracture, the Fracture is then very dangerous; and ſo much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, by how much the wound is the greater; and eſpecially if any of the greater Muſcles (as of the thigh and ſhoulder) ſhal be Wounded. For then Inflammations do very eaſily happen; and at length, the <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene,</hi> and <hi>Sphacelus.</hi> And that likewiſe which here maketh the Cure to be the more difficult is this, to wit, that the ſplinters (and the other like things that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily requred for the keeping of the bones in after they are brought back unto their proper places, cannot ſo conveniently and fitly be adminiſtred, in regard that a hole is to be kept open for the better curing of the Wound.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. If the bones be ſo broken and ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they cannot be reduced unto their former wonted State and place, we cannot then any wayes promiſe unto the Patient the recovery of his perfect health again: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the bones may poſſibly grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again; yet Nevertheleſs the Member is by this means made much ſhorter then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſo altogether unfit for the diſcharge of its former offices.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The bones when they are ſo broken that they cannot poſſibly be reſtored again, we muſt then know that it will not be long ere they be impoſtumated, and fal forth; and ſo wil likewiſe thoſe that are wholly deſtitute and bare of fleſh: ſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his third Book of <hi>Fractures, Text.</hi> 44. Now the bones impoſtumate, and drop out, ſometimes ſooner, and ſomtimes it is longer ere this be done. Thoſe bones are ſooneſt ſeparated that are ſooneſt withered, and ſooneſt dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth by the fleſh growing underneath them. And therefore the ſmal bone is ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt impoſtumated and ſeparated, and that bone likewiſe that is in ſome extreme part, and the bone alſo that is but thin; whereupon it is, that in leſs then fourteen days ſuch bones as theſe laſt ſpoken of uſe to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. But the greater and more ſolid bones are longer ere they impoſtumate and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; for it is both a longer time ere they are withered, and likewiſe ere they are driven forth by the fleſh that groweth up underneath them: and hence it is, that they are ſeldom or never impoſtumated and driven forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fourtyeth day at the ſooneſt; but now and then the impoſtumation and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forth of the bone is deferred unto the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyeth day, and oftentimes alſo for the ſpace of many Months. Yea and ſometimes it ſo happeneth that the ſmall fragments of bones ſhattered and broken al to pieces have not broken forth untill after many yeers; as we have an inſtance hereof given us by <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helm. Frabricius,</hi> in his 4. <hi>Century.</hi> and 97. <hi>Obſervation.</hi> And I my ſelf likewiſe know a very eminent Commander, a Captain of foot, who at <hi>Norinberg</hi> was with a bullet ſhot throw the right Arm; by which his ſhoulder bone was broken; out of which wound even until this very yeer 1634. there brake forth fragments and ſmal pieces of Bones.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Age likewiſe, the temper, and habit of the body, the courſe and kind of life, the time of the year, the Region, the ſtate of the Heavens, and even all things elſe
<pb n="2732" facs="tcp:49110:208"/> whatſoever that have in them a power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating the Natural ſtrength (either by augmenting or diminiſhing it) theſe al may render the Cure more or leſs difficult. And therefore it is that the Curing of a Fracture is in young perſons a matter of no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; but in ſuch as are aged and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite the cure is much harder, yea and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times altogether impoſſible.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Fractures with an Inflammation and a bruiſing of the fleſh are ful of danger; in regard that thoſe cannot be fully and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cured, until theſe ſhall firſt of all be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly healed.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Touching the time for the Conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a fracture, there can nothing of a certainty be foretold; ſeeing that it differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is very various according to the Age, habit of the body, the time of the yeer, and other ſuch like Circumſtances. For in ſuch as are young, if they be of a good habit and Conſtitution, and obſerve a good and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dyet, and live under a temperate Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; the bones in theſe are much the ſooner conſolidated: but far more ſlowly in aged people, and ſuch as are more weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>

                     <p>The Simple or Single fracture (being as it is a ſpecies of unity diſſolved) hath even one only common and univerſal indication, to wit, that what is thus diſjoyned muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be united. And although that this unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be the work of Nature, as in Wounds; yet nevertheleſs, that Nature may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attain unto her ſcope, and effect her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, there are yet many other things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. To wit, whereas the broken bones are for the moſt part removed out of their due places;<note place="margin">What things are neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the Curing of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bones.</note> if this ſhal ſo happen, then the broken bones are again to be reſtored unto their own proper places; and then in the next place, they are with all exactneſs and accurateneſs to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and joyned together, as before in their Natural ſtate; and ſo being in this exact manner conjoyned, they are thus to be kept. Which things when the chirurgeon hath with all his skill and dexterity accompliſhed, the Uniting afterward of the bones, and the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erating of the <hi>Callus,</hi> are to be committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Nature, as her proper and peculiar work. And yet Nevertheleſs, the Phyſitian ought not to be remiſs in affording unto Nature the beſt of his help and furtherance: and this he may do, if he do what he can for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the Natural temperament of the part; and take care that the inflammation and all other the Symptoms that uſually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and attend theſe fractures, and diſturb nature in her work, be prevented and kept off. Or if they ſhall at all happen, that with what ſpeed he may he remove them.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, in the firſt place, (as <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelisu Celſus</hi> teacheth us, in his <hi>B.</hi> 8. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.) we are to be wel adviſed upon mature Conſideration, whether the broken bones be fallen out of their places, yea or no: for it is alwaies ſo, that when the bones are broken in a tranſverſe or overthwart man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they fal out of their own natural Seats. Now it is known that the broken bones are not removed out of their proper places, if in the place where the fracture is there be no Cavity or hollowneſs perceived, neither any ſenſe of pricking; and that the Member doth not appear ſhorter then before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this kind of fracture there is not any need at all that the member be any whit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; or that we trouble our ſelves in the leaſt with the returning back and fit joyning together of the broken bones. For it may ſo very eaſily come to paſs (if this be but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by us) that pains may be excited, &amp; the heads and ſuch parts of the broken bones that ſtick forth may hereby be cruſhed and grated one againſt another, and ſo broken: but here we are only to endeavor, that the broken bones may be kept in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seats, and there again united, as anon we ſhall further ſhew you how this is to be done.</p>
                     <p>But if the broken bones ſhall be fallen out of their own proper places, ſo that one ſhal be carryed forth and caſt upon another, then in this caſe our firſt and main Care ought to be, that theſe broken bones may again be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto their own places. Now this is to be done (chiefly and primarily) by two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, the former whereof is called C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tataſis or <hi>Antitaſis,</hi> 1. e. <hi>an Extenſion;</hi> but the other we term <hi>Diorthoſis, i. e. Conforna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or a putting back again of the bones nto their own places. But now, ſo it is that none can rightly perform theſe operations, but he that wel underſtandeth the Nature of the bones, and knoweth the differences of fract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures. The Nature of the bones is to be known out of <hi>Galen his tract. of the bones,</hi> &amp; the books of other Anatomiſts; eſpecially by our own
<pb n="2733" facs="tcp:49110:208"/> ocular inſpection, and taking a right view of them in our Anatomy Lectures. And for the differences of Fractures, <hi>Galen</hi> (in his <hi>ſixth B.</hi> of the <hi>Meth. of Curing,</hi> and 5. <hi>Chapt.</hi>) tels us what they are.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all therefore in the reſtoring and returning back of the broken bones into their places, there is requiſite an extenſion of the part. For when as without the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſſunder of any Muſcle either the parts of the broken bone are removed out of their proper places, or elſe that the Joynt is fallen forth of its due place, the Muſcle whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is annexed unto that part into which either a part of the broken bone inclineth, or the Joynt falleth forth unto, is wholly drawn back unto its own Head; and ſo by this means together with it ſelf it carrieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long that part of the Member which is Joyned with it. Wherefore it cannot poſſibly be that either the broken bone ſhould be rightly conformed, or that the looſened bone ſhould be again reſtored back unto its own place and ſeat, before that it be ſo much drawn back as it was before removed out of its place into this or that part. For otherwiſe, if (to wit) there be not made a right extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Fractures, by attrition the eminencies (or parts ſticking forth from the bones) would be broken, by being cruſhed together one againſt the other, ſo that they could not poſſibly be put back again into their own places and Cavities, but that they muſt either externally ſtick at the ſides of the bones, or elſe they muſt ſtil remain among the broken bones, and by this means the Coaptation and due Joyning together of the bones ſhould be very much hindred.</p>
                     <p>And therefore that the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bone may be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,<note place="margin">Extenſion how to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> it is requiſite that both parts of the broken bone be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended backwards, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as need ſhall require; and this extenſion is by the Greeks called <hi>Antitaſis.</hi> But that the extenſion may be rightly done, we muſt endeavour that it may be performed either with no pain at all, or no more then needs muſt. Now this will be done, if the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be extended be placed in ſuch a Figure as wherein the Muſcles do nothing at all, but all of them are as it were idle and looſened; that ſo all the Fibres of the Muſcles of the ſaid member may be extended directly and ſtraight forward: by which means there wil be need of the leſs extenſion, and the whole buſineſs performed with very little or no pain.</p>
                     <p>Now this extenſion and diſtraction is to be done either by the labor and pains of one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, or elſe by the Hands of many together; and this indeed likewiſe either by their Hands only, or elſe alſo by certain Reins or Curbs, or by Swaths, or other Engines and devices uſed for this purpoſe. When the Finger is broken, or any other tender mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the extenſion may then be performed by the help and pains of one alone, who is to lay hold on one part of the broken mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h his right Hand, and on the other part with the left, and ſo drawing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part one from the other: or elſe it is to be done by two together, ſo that one of them may hold the part of the broken member, and the other extend and ſtretch it forth. But if the member that is broken be greater and more ſtrong, then the help of many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether will be needful; ſo that one may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with both Hands lay hold upon one part of the broken member, and another at the ſame time may likewiſe lay hold with both Hands on the other part of the broken member; that ſo they may by drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them (one from the other) bring the ſaid broken Member cloſe together. And ſomtimes likewiſe there wil be need of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it round about with Swaths, Linen Clothes, and Staies; and of fitting theſe on all ſides unto the ſaid broken Member, like as with a Cord, or Nooſe; for the drawing of all which together, (that it may be rightly done, to wit, by drawing ſeveral waies, the one from the other) the help and aſſiſtance of divers at once will be very requiſite. And oftentimes likewiſe, even then when there is occaſion for a greater extenſion (but yet without any violence) there are together with theſe certain Engines to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred; touching which, ſee <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> in his <hi>ſecond B. of Fractures, Text</hi> 40. &amp;c. <hi>and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſius,</hi> in his <hi>Tract. de Machinam.</hi> and <hi>Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> in his 15. <hi>B.</hi> and 7. <hi>Chapt.</hi>

                     <p>Now this Extenſion is either equal, or Unequal.<note place="margin">Extenſion how manifold.</note> We cal that an equal extenſion, in the which the Member is equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from both ſides of the broken bone: but the extenſion wherein the Member is more extended from one ſide of the broken bone then from the other, we then cal it an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal extenſion; and this hath then is place, when but only one of the two bones in the Ankle or the Elbow is broken: for that ſide is moſt to be extended in which the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bone is contained.</p>
                     <p>But now the <hi>Diorthoſis,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,<note place="margin">Canforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is the replacing and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting back again of the broken bone into its own place, and the right Coaptation or fitting together of the extreme parts of the broken bone; which is done, if after that the Member is ſo far forth exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the bones to be replaced cannot
<pb n="2734" facs="tcp:49110:209"/> be brought to touch one another, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon with both Hands lay hold on both parts; and that he then thruſt back unto the right part the Member that is fallen forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the left; and ſo on the other ſide, that he thruſt back unto the contrary part that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that is fallen forth forward; and ſo on the Contrary; and that he never leave thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting back the Eminencies or ſtickings out of the bones into their Cavities and hollow Seats, until the extremities, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ends of the bones be rightly united, and driven back into their proper places, and that the Member have recovered again its Natural Figure. But now theſe ſtickings out of the bones are not with any impulſe or violence at all to be thruſt back again into their Cavities, leſt that by this violent handling of them they ſhould be broken; but rather let them of their own accord (the extenſion being looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) return back into their own ſeats; and let them be gently directed hereunto by the Hands of the Chirurgeon. And all theſe things are (as ſoon as may be) to be done, before that an Inflammation happen: for if there chance to be any Inflammation, and then afterward the extenſion of the Member, and the replacing of the bones be attempted, a Convulſion may eaſily be excited.</p>
                     <p>But if the Chirurgeon be not called until the Inflammation be already begun, ſo that by reaſon thereof the bringing back of the bones may not ſo much as be attempted, then by all manner of means he ought to oppoſe the Inflammation; and he is likewiſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that it may ſpeedily be removed by thoſe Medicaments that are above propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in the <hi>firſt Part,</hi> and 5. <hi>Chapt. of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.</hi> And in the mean time he ought to be very Sollicitous and Careful of the part affected, leſt that it readily receive the fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and this may be done by Repellers; and by placing the part in ſuch a manner, and ſo handling it, that no pain at al may be brought upon the Patient. When the Inflammation is over and paſt, we muſt after that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that the bones may be reduced unto their proper places.</p>
                     <p>But then if the extremities of the broken bones break forth, and ſtick out of the Skin, by what way and means ſuch a Fracture is to be Cured, we ſhall ſhew you in the <hi>Chapter following.</hi> When theſe things are thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, we ought then to take good notice, whether or no the bones be rightly fitted and placed together. Now it may be known by this (as <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> tels us in his <hi>third B. de Officin. Medic. Text</hi> 24.) if the Patient be no longer ſo much infeſted with pain, as before; if the eminencies of the bones now conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within themſelves do no longer prick the part; if while the broken part is touched by the Hand there be perceived no Cavity, no ſticking out, or unevenneſs; and if the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Member being compared with its fellow that is ſound, (that is to ſay) the Shoulder with the Shoulder, the Thigh with the Thigh, and the Legg with the Legg, it be found to be almoſt equal, and like unto it, both in its Figure and Magnitude. Almoſt, I ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, becauſe that in the thickneſs there may be ſome kind of difference betwixt them; in regard that by reaſon of pain and the afflux of Humors, the broken Member doth for the moſt part ſwel up and grow ſomwhat big.</p>
                     <p>When we find and are ſure that the bones are conformed, the extenſion is then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to be remitted; and we are then to take care that by a fit binding up of the Member the bones when they are wel fitted and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced together may ſo remain united, and rightly conformed. And this is to be done by two other operations, to wit, the binding up and the placing of the Member. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are ſome who write, that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Fractures cannot be performed and compleatly finiſhed, but by theſe four oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, <hi>viz.</hi> Extenſion, Conformation, Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and placing of the Member.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, before ever we attempt to rowl any Swathe about the broken Member,<note place="margin">The bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of Fractures.</note> ſome certain Medicaments are wont to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laid on, for the preventing the afflux of Humors, and the Inflammation, and likewiſe for the helping forward of the <hi>Callus</hi> that is to be generated: but in this, for the matter thereof, Authors do ſomthing differ. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> maketh uſe of a <hi>Roſe Cerote: Celſus</hi> uſeth Clothes dipt in Oyl and Wine. Others there are, who at the firſt lay upon the Fracture a <hi>Cerote</hi> of <hi>Roſes</hi> with a broad Linen Cloth, and then afterward they put upon it a Linen Cloth well moyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſharp black Wine, or elſe the Juyce of Pomegranates: others uſe hurds moyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned throughly in the white of an Egg ſhaken well together, and then a little Squeezed: and others (which practice is now adaies moſt in uſe) do anoynt and ſpread upon a Linen Cloth a mixture made of the <hi>white of an Egg,</hi> and Aſtringent Pouders of <hi>Bole-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick, Dragons blood, Roſes, Pomegranate flowers, the Roots of Conſound, Frankincenſe,</hi> and the like; and this they lay upon the Fracture. Which ſaid Medicaments are in all the bindings ſo long to be continued, even until there ſhall be no further fear of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and that the Fracture begin now to be ſtable: and afterwards we are to apply (if it be in the Summer) the <hi>Diapalma Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter;</hi>
                        <pb n="2735" facs="tcp:49110:209"/> but in the Winter the <hi>Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum Barbarum;</hi> or ſome other that is in all reſpects ſuitable and Convenient. And this diverſity of the Medicaments ſeems upon very good ground (and not without Cauſe) to have been brought into uſe and practiſe by Authors. For when there is an Indication of Strengthening and Eſtabliſhing the Fracture (and that pain and the fear of an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forbid it not) the <hi>white of an Egg,</hi> and aſtringent Cataplaſms are made uſe of: but if the Patient be afflicted with ſore pain, then we are to uſe the <hi>Cerote</hi> and <hi>Oyl of Roſes, and Wine.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the dead head out of Lin-ſeed, Lin-ſeed poudered, unſalted butter, Roots of the greater Comfrey, of each four ounces; Bole-Armenick, and Ceruſs, of each one ounce; the whites of fifteen Eggs; Make a Cataplaſm; let it be put upon the Fracture, and after two daies removed. Repeat this five times, one after another.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the fineſt Flower half a pound; Maſtick, and Gum Arabick, of each one ounce; Mummy, and Bole Armenick, of each half an ounce; with the whites of Eggs make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Very uſeful likewiſe is the Emplaſter of <hi>John de Vigo,</hi> which he mentioneth in his 8. <hi>B.</hi> and 6. <hi>Chapter.</hi> And <hi>Guilhelm Fabricius</hi> in his 4. <hi>Cent. Obſervat.</hi> 99. uſeth this Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of</hi> Slobanus <hi>his Emplaſter four ounces; Powder of the Root of the greater Comfrey, of Red Roſes, and Myrtles, of each two drams; the Stone Oſteocolla prepared, ſix drams: mingle them together over a gentle Fire, with a little of the Oyl of Roſes, and make an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The common and vulgar Chirurgeons (in Fractures) are wont oftentimes (even at the very firſt) immediatly to apply the <hi>Oxycro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceum</hi> Emplaſter: or if this be not the very firſt of all, yet it is a Remedy that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail to make uſe of within a very few daies after the Fracture is made. But this cannot be done without much danger; as in <hi>the place alleadged Fabricius</hi> ſheweth us by an example. For it being ſo that this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter heateth the part affected, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by attracteth the blood and Humors, it muſt needs produce an itching, pain, Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Gangrene; and eſpecially in the Body that is Cholerick and Cacochymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                     <p>After that fit Medicaments have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the part affected, then we muſt proceed to the binding of it up; and this muſt neither be over looſe, (leſt that the bones be again removed out of their places) neither over ſtreight and hard, leſt that it hinder the afflux of the Aliment, and excite pain. Now this is to be performed with two Swaths; the one whereof (which may not unfitly be firſt moyſtened with <hi>Oxycrate</hi>) is to be caſt over the Fracture, and upwards to be rowled round about it twice or thrice, (ſo that much of the ſound part be taken in in the Swathing) that ſo the bones when they are ſet back again into their places may there be kept and continued; and likew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe that the conflux of blood unto the affected part may by this means be prevented. The other (longer then the former by the one half) is to be row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about in a Contrary manner; and being firſt of all caſt upon the Fracture, (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the ſame) it is ſome certain times to be rowled about downward, and then again to be drawn up above the ſaid Fracture; and at length to be carried toward the ſound part lying above it. For ſo by this means, if it ſhould ſo happen that by the firſt Swathe any Muſcle ſhould chance to be diſtorted and made to ſtand a wry towards ſome one part, it is amended by the ſecond; the Humor is likewiſe preſſed forth of the part; and the influx of the blood, (as well from the inferior, as the Superior parts) is hindered and prevented. For all bindings whatſoever have in them a power of preſſing forth the Humors out of thoſe parts upon which they are firſt of all caſt, into thoſe parts where they are ended.</p>
                     <p>And this binding which is performed by theſe two Swaths, is by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> called <hi>Hypodeſis;</hi> and the Swathes themſelves he calleth <hi>Hypodeſmidai.</hi> But now that in the greater bones the binding may be the more ſtable and firm, certain coverings (which the more modern Authors term <hi>Plagulae</hi> and <hi>Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>) are to be put above upon them; and then after the putting on of theſe, the binding is to be made firm and ſtrong by two equal Swath bands (which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calleth <hi>Epideſmoi</hi>) of which the one is from the lower part car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upward toward the right hand, or toward the left; and the other is carried downward the quite contrary way unto the former: which binding is by <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> termed <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſis.</hi> And here we ought to be very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the binding be not either in an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe manner (for this will not ſufficiently retein and keep in their places the bones that are newly brought back) or elſe too hard and cloſe; (for this may cauſe pain) but ſhunning the inconvenience of both the former, we are to make choyce of that middle way, that ſo we may enjoy the benefit and uſefulneſs of both. And if a few Swathings about be not ſufficient to contein and keep in the Fracture; then it will be beſt, for the more ſecurity, to add unto the number of them.</p>
                     <pb n="2736" facs="tcp:49110:210"/>
                     <p>And that the bones when they are reduced unto their proper place may be there the better eſtabliſhed and kept firm,<note place="margin">Splinters to be put upon Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, to ſtrengthen them.</note> (that they be not again moved out of their places, <hi>Ferulae</hi> (or Splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,) are to be put above upon them, if the Nature of the place affected will bear the ſame. For ſeeing that Swathes and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings which they cal <hi>Splenia</hi> are very flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and yielding, they cannot poſſibly keep the Fracture firm and direct, but that it may eaſily happen, that whether the Patient wake or ſleep, the Member may be moved. And therefore that in thoſe motions which are not much heeded the Member may be kept firm, and held tight, there will be need of thoſe things that are ſtiff, and are not eaſily bowed, and yet nevertheleſs not over weighty and ponderous. Unto which end and purpoſe (as <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> could not in all the world again (after his <hi>Plagulae</hi> or Coverings) have invented and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us with better inſtruments then theſe <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulae</hi> or Splinters, that are both ſtiff and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible; and likewiſe very light, and not at all oppreſſing the part affected by their weight. But when we want theſe Splinters, we may inſtead thereof make uſe of thin pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Wood. And ſome there are that in the place of theſe <hi>Ferulae</hi> make uſe of the Rinds or Barks of Trees. But if any wil make uſe of theſe, let him look well to it, that they be not green, but throughly dried. For thoſe that are green, when once they become dry, they then are contracted about the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and do excite pain; and ſomtimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they again remove the bones out of their places; as <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> by a peculiar example teacheth us, in his <hi>fourth Century,</hi> and 89. <hi>Obſervat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, (if need ſo require) the pipe may likewiſe be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto the Member;<note place="margin">The pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the broken Member.</note> touching which both <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> make mention, in their <hi>Tract. of thoſe things that ought to be done in the Curing of Fractures, Text</hi> 18. and the member is rightly to be placed; and we muſt ſee well to it, that its poſition be ſoft, equal and even, and turned upwards: ſoft, that ſo it may not preſs together the broken Member in that part, neither cauſe pain and inflammation: equal and even, that it may produce no pain, nor cauſe the Member to ſtand awry: and it muſt be turned upwards, that ſo the Humors by their weight tending downward may not blow unto the place affected. But more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially we muſt do our endeavour, that there may be obſerved a middle Figure of the Joynts; and ſo likewiſe a middle figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Muſcles: unto which end alſo there may be ſomtimes adminiſtred certain little Coffers or Caskets (the Latines cal them <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulae</hi>) which all the whole time of the Cure may receive and contein the broken Member. <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> (in his <hi>B. de Officin. Medic. Text</hi> 3. and 30.) in giving a right and due Scituation unto the Member, commandeth us to take notice of, and wel to heed theſe three things, Reſt, the Middle or Mean poſition, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. Reſt indeed, that ſo ſuch a Scituation of the Member may be choſen, as a man is wont to keep at that time when he is moſt free from all manner of buſineſs, and moſt addicteth himſelf to eaſe and idleneſs. But the middle Scituation is a poſture betwixt extreme diſtenſion, and Contraction; and yet nevertheleſs not alwaies exactly, but ſuch as cometh neereſt unto the mean or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle poſition. As for example; in the Arm, that is to be accounted for the middle Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which doth not Conſtitute a right Angle in the Elbow, but rather an obtuſe and blunt Angle; and ſuch as comes ſomthing nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtretching of it forth: like as we ſee men when they are quiet and idle, they hold not their Arms exactly in a juſt middle poſture betwixt being altogether ſtretched forth ſtraight, and wholly bowed and bent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but ſomwhat more inclining and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding toward a ſtretching of it forth: which Figure is therefore moſt pleaſing unto them, in regard that it is moſt free from pain. And then laſtly, Cuſtom is alſo much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and lookt upon; becauſe that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther habit is ſo eaſily born as that unto which we have accuſtomed our ſelves. Unto which we may likewiſe add a fourth, out of the ſame <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> (in his 1 <hi>B. of Fracturer,</hi> and 1 <hi>Text</hi>) to wit, that ſuch a ſtate of the Muſcle is to be choſen, under which the broken bones may be drawn divers and ſeveral waies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great adoe, or offering violence unto them; and ſuch as when the Member is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined under that habit, it is then free from all pain. He only doth both theſe, who ſo Figureth and placeth the Muſcles, that their Fibres may be direct, and ſtretched forth in a ſtraight manner. Now they may be ſaid to be direct, and directly extended, when the whole Muſcle is placed in one part of the Member. For if the Muſcle that hath its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the interior part be ſo placed that the Scituation thereof be in the middle from the interior part, and extreme from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior; or ſo, that the Scituation of it be in the midſt from the ſuperior part, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme from the exterior, by this means it is wrapped together about the Member, and ſo extended.</p>
                     <p>Now when the binding is right, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as it ought to be, it is known by this;
<pb n="2737" facs="tcp:49110:210"/> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tells us, in his 1 <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>) firſt of all, by the moan and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made by the ſick perſon, when you ask him whether he be preſſed too hatd by the ſaid binding, and he ſhall anſwer, that he is indeed preſſed, but lightly, (and ſo that he can wel endure it) and that eſpecially in the place where the Fracture is. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoever he be that hath his Fracture rightly bound up, he muſt of Neceſſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that theſe things are ſo. But when the Patient is abundantly troubled and pained under theſe ſwathes, they are then ſpeedily to be looſened, and more fitly to be bound; leſt that from the too hard binding danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſymptoms ſhould happen to ariſe. But on the other ſide, if the windings about of the ſwathes be looſer then is meet, and that the Patient ſhall anſwer that he feels not the ſwathing at all, the ſwathes are then to be drawn ſomwhat harder; in regard that theſe bindings if they be over looſe, they cannot prevent the Members being depraved in that part where the Fracture is.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo other ſigns of a Moderate binding, and when it is as it ought to be. If the ſame day and night in which he was bound up with theſe ſwathes he ſeemeth to himſelf not to be lightly bound, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard and ſtreight; and the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a ſoft and ſmall tumor ariſe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the Member. For the ſmalneſs of the ſwelling and ſoftneſs ſheweth that there is ſomthing preſſed forth (by the binding) from the part affected unto the extremity and utmoſt part of the Member. But if there appear no ſwelling, it ſheweth that the frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not bound hard enough: and if the ſwelling be great and hard (that is, ſuch as wil not readily yield unto the touch) that is preſent in the extreme or utmoſt part of the Member, it then giveth us a ſure ſign and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the part affected is too hard ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and bound up.</p>
                     <p>And therefore if we find the ſigns of a due and fit binding up of the fracture, and that there be no conſiderable pain preſent, neither any inflammation or exulceration ſuſpected, the reſt of the work (which is the producing of a <hi>Callus,</hi> by the which the broken bones are Joyned together) is to be committed to Nature, whoſe work it is; and the binding not to be looſned before the third day. But on the third day let the ſwathes be looſened, and again rowled about the fracture, to the end they may both be drawn harder and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer upon the place affected; as alſo that there may be opened a paſſage forth for the humors and vapours contained under the skin: which that they may be ſcattered, and that there may be no itching excited (or if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Itching that infeſteth the Party) <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> wil have the Member to be bathed in warm water (or the water to be poured upon it,) that ſo the pores may be opened. But if we be ſlow in the looſening of the binding, there ariſe from thence oftentimes great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; to wit, an exulceration of the part, a putridneſs, and Gangrene, yea and even the hazard and danger of the life. Examples whereof we meet with in <hi>Guilhelm. Frabricius,</hi> in his <hi>ſecond Century,</hi> and 91. <hi>Obſervat.</hi> And therefore he adviſeth us that every ſecond, or at leaſt every third day, the binding be alwaies looſened: and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though after the ſeventh day there be no ſuch urgent Neceſſity of the often looſening the fracture, yet Nevertheleſs his own pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe was every fourth day to looſen the ſwathbands; and (as he writeth) his Cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om was to take an exact view of the part affected. And this binding is to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until ſuch time as the <hi>Callus</hi> be bred, and the fracture healed; which in the Thigh is wont to be done in fourty days, in the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Ankle in thirty, in the <hi>Radius</hi> and Elbow in twenty, and in the bones of the Fingers in five days. But yet this time cannot be ſo eaſily and preciſely determined in all of them (as we told you in the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks) but it much varyeth according to the Aage, Conſtitution of body, time of the yeer, and the Nature and Condition of the Fracture it ſelf: for a fracture is much ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cured in a young perſon, then in one that is Aged; and ſooner in the ſpring time, then in the ſummer.</p>
                     <p>But in the Mean time (While theſe things are in doing) univerſal Medicaments are not to be neglected; to wit, the opening of a vein, and purgation, even according as this or that Conſtitution of the patient ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And al theſe things are to be done for this end, that ſo the bones may be congluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. Now this is done by the benefit of the <hi>Callus;</hi> which whether it be ſomthing that is heterogeneous, or elſe in its ſubſtance like unto the bones, we have ſhewn you above, part. 4. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 4. But now the generating and production of the <hi>Callus</hi> (by which the bones are conglutinated and made to grow together) it is the work of Nature:<note place="margin">The generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> but yet the Phyſitian may and ought to help and aſſiſt Nature in this her operation; and this he may do, if he take care to prevent and keep off inflammations, or the like Accidents that might any way hurt the ſubſtance and Temperament of the Member; and that the Aliment it ſelf by drying Medicaments be ſo diſpoſed, that it may thereby the ſooner be changed into a <hi>Callus.</hi> Now this may almoſt
<pb n="2738" facs="tcp:49110:211"/> wholly be effected by the Medicaments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned; in the place whereof (after a few daies) there are to ſucceed likewiſe the <hi>Emplaſter Diapalma, the Emplaſtrum Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barum, Oxycroceum, the black Emplaſter,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>And furthermore let the Phyſitian endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that there may be a ſufficient ſupply of a matter fit for the breeding of the <hi>Callus.</hi> Unto which end, the Food adminiſtred unto the Patient let it be ſomwhat more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully given then formerly; and let it be of a good and ſomwhat a Tenacious Juyce; ſuch as proceeds from Rice, Wheat, and the like. But becauſe that before the twelfth day there is ſcarcely ever any <hi>Callus</hi> generated, or that ſo much as beginneth to breed; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that at firſt there are many Symptoms to be feared: therefore this ful Dyet is not preſently to be allowed of in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but a more ſparing Dyet is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; yea and (if need require) blood is to be drawn forth by opening a Vein, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to be ordered unto the Patient; and then after this, in the end (as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) when the <hi>Callus</hi> beginneth to be generated, a more ful Dyet is to be allowed him.</p>
                     <p>And there are wont likewiſe ſome Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be adminiſtred inwardly, which conduce much unto the more ſpeedy gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and producing of the <hi>Callus;</hi> as the <hi>Pouder</hi> and <hi>Juyce</hi> of <hi>Agrimony Roots.</hi> And very many there are, that commend moſt highly the <hi>Oſteocolla</hi> ſtone before ſpoken of; of which beaten ſmal into a pouder they oftentimes give one dram, with <hi>Comfrey Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But in ſuch as are young, and thoſe that are of a good habit, this <hi>Callus</hi> groweth and increaſeth too much by this ful Dyet: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be allowed unto them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much caution; but only unto ſuch as are more ſtricken in yeers.

                     <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> Of a Fracture with a Wound.</head>
                  <p>THe main and chief Difference of a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (and that which very much varieth the Cure) is a Fracture with a Wound. Now this happeneth when the ſharp Eminencies or points of the broken bones do perforate the fleſh that lieth upon them. Which whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it happeneth, the Member is made ſhorter then it was before: but when the naked and bare bones are reſtored again unto their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places, the Member then returneth unto its priſtine Longitude. And yet nevertheleſs ſomtimes theſe like fractures happen by ſome cutting Weapon, when by it not only the fleſh, but even the very bone it ſelf is Cut.</p>
                  <p>But now in theſe Fractures with a Wound, the bone is ſomtimes made naked; and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again it is not left altogether bare: and moreover ſomtimes alſo we fear the falling out of the bone, or ſome Fragment thereof; but then ſomtimes again we fear no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <div type="prognosis">
                     <head>Prognoſticks.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. But now ſuch like Fractures are yet far more dangerous, if they happen to be with the Fleſh and Skin lying over it remaining ſtil whole and ſound. For that perforation exciteth a pain and an Inflammation of the Skin and Fleſh; and ſo the Muſcles that are now affected with this Inflammation are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuffer a double extenſion; one that is cauſed by the Inflammation; the other, that which happeneth unto them from theſe things that befal them while they are returning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their former length.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But now this danger is ſo much the greater by how much the parts that are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſhattered are more noble and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; as the Muſcles, Nerves, Veins, and Arteries.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And from hence it is, that a Fracture in the Thigh and Shoulders, with a Wound, and the falling out of a bone, is the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous of all: touching which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thus, in his <hi>third B. of Fractures, Text</hi> 47. <hi>But they ſeldom or never eſcape</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whoſe bones (either of the Arm or Thigh) have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len outwardly: for as theſe bones are very great, and very ful of Marrow: ſo likewiſe there are beſides theſe many other things wounded that are of very great moment; to wit, the Nerves, Muſcles, and Veins; whereupon alſo it is, that if you put them back, Convulſions are wont to be excited: but then again if you do not put them back into their former places, there will then ariſe acute and Cholerick Feavers, with a ſighing, and a blackneſs of the place affected. Yet notwithſtanding they do not leſs eſcape, in whom we neither put them back, nor ſo much as attempt the doing of it. But furthermore, they alſo are more lively to eſcape, who have the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer bone, then thoſe that have their upper bone fallen forth outwardly. And they likewiſe do ſometimes eſcape with life (but this is very ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Whereupon it is that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his 3 <hi>B of Fractures,</hi> and 47. <hi>Text</hi>) writeth; <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it moreover a matter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of little Conſequence whether or no the bone break forth unto the exterior part of the Arm or Thigh; in regard that through the interior parts of them there are carried along many and thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal) Veins; of which if any chance to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and battered together, they Choak and Throttle the party; but the Veins that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed through the Exterior parts, as they are fewer, ſo they are leſs conſiderable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. A Fracture with a Wound, if it be made with ſome cutting Weapon, is dangerous, if it be a great bone that is cut, ſuch as is that of the Thigh or the Shoulder. For ſuch like bones as theſe (eſpecially if the inciſion be direct and ſtraight) will very hardly be brought to grow together again; becauſe that by this cutting Weapon the pores of the bone, through which the Aliment for the breeding of the <hi>Callus</hi> did formerly paſs, are in a manner obſtructed, and ſo the <hi>Callus</hi> is the longer ere it be generated. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in regard that ſuch a Fracture is equal, the broken bones are moſt difficultly kept from being moved; and ſo by this the Coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and growing together of theſe bones is very much impeded.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="cure">
                     <head>The Cure in General.</head>
                     <p>We have here two Indications given us: the former whereof is, that the bones be
<pb n="2740" facs="tcp:49110:212"/> again reſtored unto their own places, and there exactly Joyned together; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, that the Wound may be healed. The replacing of the bones is here altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, by reaſon of the parts that are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded which without great pain, and fear of a convulſion, cannot be extended. Now the way and means to return theſe bones unto their places again, is, firſt of all by extending them ſufficiently, but yet without all kind of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: which if it cannot otherwiſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be done, then we muſt have ready at hand firm and ſtrong Iron Inſtruments, (like unto Bars) ſomthing different in their bigneſs one from the other; out of which ſome one of them that is fit and convenient, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour part is to be adminiſtred unto the lower part of the broken bone, but in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior part unto the upper part of the ſaid broken bone, (like unto an Iron Sparre or Leaver) and ſo by this means the broken bones ſhall be forced and driven again into their proper places: touching which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> (in the 3. <hi>B. of Fractures, Text</hi> 39.) writeth in theſe words: <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the bone alſo that is fallen forth upon another bone leave not any fit place for the Iron Sparre; or if that it be ſo ſharp that it ſtart away from it, we muſt then with a File hollow the ſaid broken bone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til there be a place made for the Iron Sparre, and that it firmely ſtick unto it.</hi> And the truth is, all theſe things are to be done inſtantly, even the very firſt day, before any Inflammation to ariſe. For if this ſhould happen, neither the extenſion nor ſuch putting back of the bones can be ſo much as attempted without very great danger. If therefore the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon be not ſent for even at the very firſt, and that he come not until there now plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be preſent an Inflammation, he ought to deferr the putting back of the bones into their places, until he find the Inflammation over and gone. I my ſelf once on a time was preſent at the Curing of a certain Peaſant, who getting up into a Tree to beat down the Acorns, fel down from it, and brake his Leg neer unto the Ankle, inſomuch that the bone ſticking out reſted it ſelf and lay upon the Ankle bone. And he not having in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs a fit and expert Chirurgeon, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and <hi>Gangrene</hi> happened, which waſted and conſumed almoſt all the Skin and Fleſh about the Ankle. He was then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the City, where the <hi>Gangrene</hi> cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the bone ſtanding forth by the Iron Sparre or leaver was lifted up, and reſtored unto its former place; and then after this all things elſe that were neceſſary being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Fracture and Wound were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                     <p>But if it happen that any ſmal part of the bone ſhall ſo ſtick out that it cannot eaſily be put back again into its proper place, but that by reaſon of its various Fraction one part and portion of the bone be an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto another; and that likewiſe it be not thought fit to attempt any ſtronger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the ſoft parts, by reaſon of the pain and Convulſion that may thence be feared; and that the bones may in their conformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rent and tear thoſe parts that lie neer them, and thereby produce pain; in al theſe regards <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his 3. <hi>B. of Fractures, Text</hi> 4.) adviſeth us to cut them off, either with the cutting File, or with the Saw, as it ſhall be thought moſt convenient, and as may be done with moſt opportunity. And ſo likewiſe, if any portion of the bone break the Fleſh, and excite pains, (ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as attempt the replacing of them without a greater diſruption) and excrucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tortures in the higheſt degree, even in this Caſe alſo we ought to cut off the bone. But then withal, leſt that what happeneth through neceſſity in the Artificial operation ſhould be imputed unto the Error of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, the Patient and the by-ſtanders are to be foretold that that part will be ſhorter then before. And this likewiſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his 3. <hi>B. of Fractures,</hi> and 46. <hi>Text</hi>) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth us of, whiles he ſaith, <hi>That it is alſo fit that we know this, that of neceſſity the Bodies muſt there be made ſhorter, where the broken bones are diminiſhed, that is to ſay, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by being cut off.</hi> But now in ſuch Fractures as theſe that are Joyned together with the Wound of the Skin and Fleſh lying upon them, we muſt look well to it likewiſe, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever we Joyn the bones together, and alſo after that they are thus Joyned) that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all ſtick betwixt the broken bones, which may any way hinder the Conglutinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and if any thing be found ſticking there, (whether it be ſome ſmal part of a bone, or any thing elſe) it is forthwith to be taken out; but this muſt not be done with any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, leſt that a pain, Inflammation, or Convulſion ſhould be excited. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if at the firſt, (even in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) this cannot be performed without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and pain, it will be more adviſedly done of us to defer it, for Nature her ſelf wil at length thruſt forth every thing that is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous, and that ſhould not be there; and yet nevertheleſs we ought to help Nature (al we can) with attracting Medicaments.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding how to be ordered..</note>But now as for the manner how the binding up of ſuch a like Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture with a Wound ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and ordered, in this neither the Ancients, nor yet the more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors, do agree among themſelves:
<pb n="2741" facs="tcp:49110:212"/> for ſome of them are wont to binde up the Fracture, as otherwiſe they did when it was without a Wound; that ſo the Wound may be likewiſe covered; and they alſo loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen this binding every third day: and ſome there are that rowl about the Swathes in ſuch a manner, that the Wound is not at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within them, but left naked; ſo that we may from day to day uſe all due means for the curing thereof, without any frequent binding up and looſening of the whole Fracture. Others there are that uſe fewer Swathes, and bind up the Fracture after the uſual and ordinary manner: but then others there be that adminiſter broader and more Swathes; that ſo by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Swathes they may accompliſh that which might have been done with fewer when hard and ſtreightly rowled. And ſome there are that altogether neglect and diſregard the ſplinters; others there be that make great uſe of them; and of thoſe that make uſe of them, ſome apply them a good diſtance off from the wound; but others apply them even upon the very wound it ſelf; but then in that part that lyeth upon the wound they make a hole, that ſo the <hi>Pus</hi> may paſs forth thereat, and that ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments as are needful may be applyed thorow the ſame. <hi>Caeſar Magatus</hi> (in his <hi>B. of Wounds, Chapt.</hi> 6.) inſiſteth ſtil in his own Method; and here likewiſe in this caſe he hath no regard at al unto the wound; and unleſs there happen to follow here upon any thing elſe that may force him to do otherwiſe he deferreth the looſening until the fifteenth day, and ſomtimes unto the thirtyeth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the quality of the fracture, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wound ſeem to perſwade: and look how much the longer time the fracture requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for the making of it firm and ſtrong, ſo much the longer doth he defer the looſening. And (as he writeth) the generating of the <hi>Pus</hi> in the wound doth not at all deter him. For (ſaith he) if it be cured in this manner, there is then a far leſs quantity thereof generated by reaſon of the heat of the ſtrengthning Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; &amp; as for that which is bred without the wound, he writeth that nature expelleth forth this. And that this may be the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, he openeth and maketh ſlits (over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wound) thorow al the linen Clothes by certain ſmall cuttings; thorow which the <hi>Sanies</hi> (or thin excrement) that is bred may be driven forth.</p>
                     <p>Now although that in ſuch operations and handy-works we may oftentimes in divers and different manners attain unto the ſame deſired end; yet notwithſtanding both <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> and likewiſe all the more Skilful and experienced Chirurgeons, take it for a moſt certain and undoubted truth, that the firſt binding ought ſo to be inſtituted, that the wound may not be left naked and bare; but that it may be comprehended within the ſwathe. And therefore the ſwathe is firſt of al indeed to be caſt upon the Wound itſelf: for if it be otherwiſe done, the humors wil be preſſed forth from the Superior part downward toward the wound, and many dangerous Symptoms are from thence exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And the danger of thus doing we may ſee experimentally even in one that is ſound and free from any ſuch fracture. For if in any ſuch perſon you binde any one part both above and beneath, and leave the middle part untouched, then the ſaid middle part by the Humors that are from the adjacent Members forced and preſſed unto them, is lifted up into a Tumor; and from the influx of the Humors (as we ſee) it ſoon chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its color. And albeit that in the firſt bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Member ſhall be all of it wrapt up within the Swathes; yet notwithſtanding there will not from hence be any cauſe to fear the leaſt danger; in regard that for the firſt three daies there floweth forth but very little either of <hi>Pus</hi> or <hi>Sanies,</hi> that is to ſay, the thick or thin Excrements. But here alſo even in this kind of binding it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that we are to make uſe of a Swathe that is ſomwhat broader than ordinary, and then otherwiſe when there is no Wound preſent; and that there be indeed a ſufficient compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made; it being then to be accounted ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, when it can retein and keep together the bones: but yet it muſt be ſomwhat leſs then if there were preſent no Wound; leſt that the wounded part being preſſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a pain and Inflammation ſhould thence be excited: and the number of the Swathes may compenſate the more looſe and eaſie binding and rowling of them; ſince that it is far more ſafe to rowl about the Swathes oftner, then any way to hurt the part by Compreſſion.</p>
                     <p>On the third day the binding is to be looſened; and then it is again to be ordered after the firſt manner. And then moſt fitly and conveniently there may be a hole cut through the Emplaſter or Cataplaſm that is impoſed upon the Fracture; yea and in the midſt of the very Swathes there is a hole to be left; (and ſo alſo in the Splinters, if there ſhall be any applied) that ſo there may fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Medicaments be adminiſtred unto the Wound; and that the Wound may alſo be throughly cleanſed and purged, without any looſening of the Fracture. And this way of binding is lively ſet forth unto us by <hi>Ambroſe Parry,</hi> in his 14. <hi>B. Chapt.</hi> 18. and 23. For whereas the broken bones (that are wont to
<pb n="2742" facs="tcp:49110:213"/> perforate the Skin) are not alwaies lo ſharp (as in thoſe Fractures that are made by the Sword) that together with them the fleſh is bruiſed together, and a hole made through it; which when of neceſſity it muſt be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into <hi>Pus,</hi> abundance of the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> muſt neceſſarily be bred; which if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined (as needs it muſt, if the Wound be wholly bound up) ſoon becometh ſharp, and ſo exciteth an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ching and pain, and divers other miſchiefs; although that Nature be ſtrong and vigorous; yet nevertheleſs the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating of abundance of the ſaid <hi>Pus</hi> cannot be avoided; ſince that all whatſoever is bruiſed muſt of neceſſity be converted into <hi>Pus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And although that <hi>Magatus</hi> doth cut and make little ſlits in all the Linen that he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon the Wound, that ſo there may be a free and ready paſſage for the <hi>Pus;</hi> yet notwithſtanding all the inconveniences that proceed from the retention of the <hi>Pus</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by this means be prevented. For if thoſe Swathes and Linen Clothes ſhal not be ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the fifteenth, and ſomtimes even the thirtieth day, they muſt certainly be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much deſiled and polluted by the <hi>Pus</hi> and <hi>Sanies;</hi> whereupon in the wounded part an itching, pain, and exulceration may follow. But then on the other ſide, if the Swathes be ſtill kept whole, and not at all cut, and thereupon to be looſned every third day; it is then to be feared, leſt that the <hi>Pus</hi> retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned may in the mean time excite ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief or other; and alſo leſt that in ſo many looſenings and new bindings up again the bones may be removed out of their places, and having been wel ſet and joyned together they ſhould again be depraved and diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: which may eaſily be avoided, if the binding be but ſeldom looſened, and the Wound kept open. And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as often as the Wound is dreſſed, it may be covered over with a new Swathe, (which may contain both Medicaments and thoſe Coverings they cal <hi>Splenia</hi>) and may defend the Wound from the external Air; and it may be looſened as often as there is any need thereof; but then indeed it muſt be without any agitation, ſhaking, or violent moving of the broken Member.</p>
                     <p>And there muſt alſo no Splinters be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leſt that they too much compreſs the Wound, and beget a pain and Inflammation. And if any will needs apply them, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they are not to be put upon the very Wound, but neer unto the ſame. Yet the truth is, the number of the Swathes may very well ſupply the uſe of theſe <hi>Ferulae</hi> or Splinters. And theſe things are thus ſimply to be performed, if there be neither any bone naked and bare, and that we fear not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumating and falling cut of any broken piece and fragment of the bone.</p>

                     <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of a Fracture with a Wound, in which there is no bone made bare, and yet nevertheleſs a Cauſe to fear the falling forth of ſome fragments of the broken bone.</head>
                  <p>IT happeneth oftentimes notwithſtanding in Fractures with Wounds that there is no bone at all left naked and bare: and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs we may have great cauſe to fear that ſome broken bone may impoſtumate and drop forth: and this is done when the bones are made dry and withered, ſo that they cannot be agglutinated unto the ſound bone; or in a Fracture, when they are ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the reſt of the bone, that they can no more be joyned therewith. For then Nature endeavoureth to thruſt forth whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is troubleſom and burdenſom unto her, and what cannot be united unto the reſt of the bones; neither is ſhe at reſt until whatſoever offendeth be wholly expelled out of the Body: and this oftentimes ſhe doth at length perform although it be a long time firſt.</p>
                  <p>Now this happeneth, when the bones are either corrupted by the <hi>Sanies,</hi> or elſe when they are altered by the external Air; or elſe likewiſe when they are ſo ſeparated (in a Fracture) from the reſt of the bones, that they cannot poſſibly be any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with them.</p>
                  <div type="diagnosis">
                     <head>Signs Diagnoſtick.</head>
                     <p>Now what the Signs are of a bone like to be impoſtumated, and to drop forth, we are told by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his 3. <hi>B. of Fractures, Text</hi> 18. The Firſt Sign is this, that there floweth forth a greater abundance of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> (or thin Excrement) then could ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be expected from the greatneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Wound. Secondly, That the Lips of the wound do not meet together; or if they do at any time meet together, yet they ſoon ſeem as it were to be broken, and to be ſtirred up and provoked to excretion; and they become as it were looſe and ſpungy; and there is perceived in the wounded part a certain ſilent motion. For Nature doth not entirely heal a Wound, when there is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaining within that cannot poſſibly be agglutinated with the reſt. Thirdly, If the bone be left bare of Fleſh, it is then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="2743" facs="tcp:49110:213"/> a Sign of its ſeparation and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forth; in regard that then it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and corrupted by the external Air, and that the Veins and Arteries (which convey the Aliment) can no longer run forth unto it. And Fourthly, It is then likewiſe a Sign that the bones will fal out, if they be broken and ſhattered into many ſmal pieces and frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for then they cannot all of them be eaſily Conglutinated.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="prognosis">
                     <head>Prognoſticks.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. It is a Sign of an <hi>Abſceſſion</hi> inſtantly to follow, if there be good Fleſh bred in the ſides of the ſound bone.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But the time in which the bones are wont to recede and fal forth is various, and not at all times alike. For in thoſe of a tender Age, and in the Summer, and if the bone be not very great, it is twenty, thirty, or perhaps fourty daies, ere the bone will be ſeparated and fall forth. But if the bone be any thing great, in one of a ful and ripe Age, and in the Winter time, it is uſually three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore daies, yea and ſomtimes longer, ere it impoſtumate and drop forth.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="cure">
                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>If the bone that is like to fal forth be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of its place, and that it ſtick in the very Wound, it is immediatly (as we told you before) to be drawn forth with the <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſella</hi> or Pincers; if it may indeed be ſo drawn forth without any pain and violence: but otherwiſe the whole buſineſs is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto Nature, which by degrees wil at the length ſeparate that which cannot be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinated. And yet nevertheleſs ſhe is to be aſſiſted and holpen by the Phyſitian; and therefore the binding ought to be inſtituted in a loole manner, and often unbound, that ſo the <hi>Pus</hi> and filth may not be deteined, but that it may freely and eaſily flow forth. And likewiſe there are no Splinters to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon that place by which the bone is like to fal forth, leſt that by compreſſion they cauſe pain.</p>
                     <p>And ſo alſo there are Medicaments to be laid upon the Wound, that have in them a power of drawing forth of the Wound the bones and whatſoever is extraneous and no way belonging unto the part affected; and ſuch Medicaments we have above mentioned in the <hi>place alleadged.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if there be ſome great and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry portion of the bone like to drop forth, and this becauſe that the parts of the broken bone cannot be again compoſed and made to Joyn with the other; (<hi>for whatſoever bones ſhal refuſe to be replaced, we ought to know that theſe will ſeparate and fal forth; as alſo thoſe that are naked and bare of Fleſh;</hi> as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> writeth (in his <hi>B. of Fractures, Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Text</hi> 44.) ſuch like wounded parts are to be handled with all gentleneſs. For by reaſon of motion and compreſſion there happen many times moſt vehement pains, the ſmal parts of the broken bone not rightly placed together pricking the parts that lie neer unto them, theſe parts being very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of pain: whereupon it is that thoſe bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings that in other Fractures are very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, in ſuch Fractures as theſe would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite moſt vehement pains.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (as he tels us in his <hi>B. of Fractures, Section</hi> 3. <hi>Text</hi> 21.) that ſo he might avoid theſe inconveniences, maketh no uſe of the Swathe, leſt that he ſhould preſs together the part too much, and leſt if the part ſhould at all be lifted up he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite pain; but having finiſhed the replacing of the bones, (as far as it may be done) and having taken away all thoſe fragments of bones that may be taken away, he then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth unto the Wound the pitched Cerot, or ſome other Cerot fit to be put upon bloody Wounds: and then after he hath thus done, becauſe that there is an imminent danger of a fluxion, from the weakneſs of the part, and from pain, (and likewiſe that the flux of Humors may be driven back, the part ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, &amp; the Fracture made firm and ſtable) he putteth round about it thoſe coverings we cal <hi>Splenia,</hi> doubled; or the <hi>Plagulae</hi> of thin Linen; in breadth half as broad as half the Palm of the Hand, and no narrower; but then in length a little ſhorter then that they ſhould come twice about the wounded Member, but yet ſomthing longer then to compaſs about but once only. For if they ſhould be longer, then of neceſſity (when the Medicaments are renewed) the Member muſt be lifted up: and if they were ſhorter; they could not then ſufficiently ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh the Fracture. Thoſe Linen Clothes being firſt throughly moyſtened in ſharp or ſowr Wine, and ſo many in number as are neceſſary, (that ſo there may be place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them) are ſo to be applied unto the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that their Heads may be drawn by the place affected, not round and Circularly, but a little ſloping, ſo as that from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part (where they began,) they may be brought together the one to the other, after the ſimilitude of the letter X. and that ſo they may cut croſs one another like unto the aforeſaid Letter, by drawing the right Head unto the left part, and the left Head unto the right part. Which <hi>Splenia,</hi> in regard that they are not very long, and may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that the part may not be lifted up, in this reſpect they are very convenient. And
<pb n="2744" facs="tcp:49110:214"/> inſtead of the Wine we may likewiſe very fitly adminiſter other Medicaments alſo, which are as good for the very ſame uſe.</p>
                     <p>There may likewiſe notwithſtanding be adminiſtred a binding which is compleated with once only rowling about; and it may be performed with a Swathe, which is to be folded together with a twice or thrice doubled Linen Cloth, (after the manner of a Croſs-cloth) and ſo very dexterouſly to be ſewed together in their ſides; and ſo broad that it may cover the whol Wound.</p>
                     <p>But now becauſe that binding by which the bones (when they are again ſet in their places) are ſo to be kept from ſtarting out of their ſaid places hath not any being or uſe in this caſe, therefore thoſe Wooden Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, Pipes, or the like engines are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, that they may keep the broken part in its proper place. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this is carefully to be heeded, that nothing that is hard be immediatly applied unto the part; but that betwixt the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded part and thoſe Engines there be interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome ſoft <hi>Splenia</hi> coverings, that ſo there may be no compreſſion made: touching which ſee <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his 3. <hi>B. of Fractures,</hi> and 23. <hi>Text.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, If the extremities or ends of the broken bones break out and ſtick forth without the Skin, we are then to do our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavour that they may not be altered and corrupted by the external Air, ſo that afterward they muſt of neceſſity be cut off; and therefore we muſt labour that they may forthwith be replaced, and covered with their Natural covering the Skin: which in what manner it ought to be performed, we have told you above in the Second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <p>BUt now, in regard that there are various Preternatural affects that are wont to ſucceed and follow upon Fractures, (which partly retard the Cure, and partly remain even after the Fracture is cured, and are to be taken away) we ſhall likewiſe treat of theſe. Now there are many of theſe like affects, as Pain, Inflammation, and a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> following upon this, an Itching, an Excoriation, an Exulceration, a depraved Figure of the Member, a <hi>Callus</hi> either greater or leſs then what Juſtly it ought to be, an Extenuation of the Member, ſlenderneſs, and debility; touching all which we intend now to ſpeak.</p>
                  <div n="pain" type="complaint">
                     <head>Pain.</head>
                     <p>If there be any pain preſent, this is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be aſſwaged and taken away; for otherwiſe by reaſon hereof the Humor will flow together unto the part affected, and ſo an Inflammation and other miſchiefs wil be excited. But now that it may the better be taken away, we are to conſider from what Cauſe it proceedeth, and that (if poſſibly it may be) is inſtantly to be removed. And therefore we are to be wel adviſed, whether this pain be from ſome bone that pricketh, or from the Swathes too hard drawn; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be from the ill Scituation of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; or elſe from the afflux of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p>If the pain ariſe from a bone that pricketh, (and this is known by the light and gentle handling of the part, and the pricking pain following thereupon) then the Swathes are to be looſened, and the pricking bone is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be put back into its proper place, or (if it may conveniently be done) taken forth, or cut off. Touching which <hi>Celſus</hi> thus, in his 8. <hi>B.</hi> and 10. <hi>Chapter. A Fracture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth ſomtimes vex the Fleſh with certain ſharp pricks as it were, which being known by the itching and pricking, it will be beſt to open it, for there is a neceſſity of cutting off theſe ſharp pricks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the pain ariſe from the over hard binding of the Swathes; this is found by the ſwelling that appeareth in the extremity of the part, and the ſick perſon complaineth that he is vehemently preſſed. And then the Swathes are forthwith to be looſened, and the binding to be made more eaſie.</p>
                     <p>If the pain proceed from an ill Scituation and poſture of the Member, the ſick perſon doth eaſily diſcover this; and it requireth a change of the Scituation; which ought ſo to be ordered, that the Patient may now confeſs himſelf that he is without pain.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, If the pain be from the afflux of the Humors, the way and means of curing it is the very ſame with that of an Inflammation in its beginning; as we ſhall by and by ſhew you.</p>

                     <p>For if there be a pain excited from the afflux of the Humors and an Inflammation follow thereupon; we are then to oppoſe the very firſt beginning of the Inflammation, in that manner as we told you above, in the firſt part, and 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> To wit, the Member that is bound up muſt be looſened, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Oyl of Roſes, either alone, or mingled with the white of an Egg: or elſe ſuch a like Cataplaſm is to be laid on.</p>

                     <p>But before the Inflammation be ceaſed, the part is not to be bound up, or certainly, (at leaſt) not to be hard bound; neither are the Splinters, nor any one of thoſe kind of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, to be impoſed; unleſs it be that they may prop up the member, and contain the Medicaments.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>This evil is Cured (if the <hi>Callus</hi> be new and hath not been bred above ſix moneths, and the ſick perſon of a ripe age, and ſtrong, and the broken bone not very great, and the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Member not much hurt) if the <hi>Callus</hi> be again broken, and the bones rightly fitted and ſet together. Now this breaking of the <hi>Callus</hi> is the more eaſily done, if the <hi>Callus</hi> be firſt for ſome daies fomented with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Emollient Herbs, as for inſtance, the Roots and Leaves of Marſh-Mallows, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Figs fat and dry: and then let a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm of the ſame Roots and Herbs be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards laid on, or elſe an Emollient Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Or elſe you may adminiſter ſome ſuch Emollient Unguent as this that followeth.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Unguent Dialthaea, one ounce and half; Bdellium, Maſtick, Turpentine, of each half an ounce; the Marrow of the Legs of Veal, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Camomile, the fat of a Hen, of each ſix drams; the Mucilage of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, and Fenugreek, of each one ounce; Wax as much as wil ſuffice; and make a ſoft <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>

And then the Heads of the bones are rightly to be fitted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and a Convenient Cure inſtituted for this new Fracture.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Callus</hi> be now already old and of long continuance, and that it be waxen very hard, and that the Patient be weak, or aged, the beſt courſe will be (as <hi>Albucaſis</hi> adviſeth) not to lay Hands at all upon it, by reaſon of the dangerous Symptoms that are wont to follow thereupon, in this kind of Cure. For it is much better, of two evils to chooſe the leſs; and to be content rather to live yet longer (though deformed and lame) for many yeers, then by a cruel Cure to attract dangerous and deadly Symptoms. Yet it is a thing impoſſible, (if the <hi>Callus</hi> be old and obdurate) to break it; but if any

                  <p>ANd furthermore it happeneth oftentimes, that after a Fracture the Member re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſlender and weak: which is cauſed either through the ſcarcity of the Aliment, whiles that by the long and various bindings of the Swathes the Veins carrying the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the part are ſtreightened, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh cloſed up; or elſe when the ſick perſon hath not food enough allowed him to Eat and Drink: and that likewiſe which maketh very much hereunto is a long continued reſt of the Member, and its Ceſſation from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we muſt by all means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, that a more plentiful Aliment may be attracted unto the part. And therefore as much as is fit the Member is to be moved, and reduced unto its wonted and accuſtomed motions; and to be fomented with Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that only attract the Aliment unto the part affected, and do not any waies ſcatter it. And Dropaciſms are here likewiſe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe. <hi>Or,</hi>

                  <p>And ſomtimes alſo it happeneth (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in aged perſons) that the broken bones will not be brought to grow together again; of which thing <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> (in his 1 <hi>Cent. Obſervat.</hi> 92.) hath a Hiſtory. The very like whereunto there happened here of late, in a very learned man, who is yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. This man was in the very ſame caſe with the other mentioned and deſcribed by <hi>Guilhel. Fabricius.</hi> For he can indeed write with his right Hand; but if at any time he deſire to liſt up his whole right Arm (which he had broken) either forward or backward, he then needeth the aſſiſtance and ſupport of his left Hand.</p>
                  <p>Now this cometh to paſs, if the bones (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be ſet,) be not kept in their places ſteady and unmoved; and this likewiſe was the cauſe of what happened unto that learned perſon we but even now mentioned. For he being very Fleſhy and Corpulent, and his Shoulder that he had broken being not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to be bound up in a right manner, and hard enough, and he in the night time ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping very unquietly, and continually turning himſelf in his bed; and moreover, by reaſon of his extraordinary ſweating in his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Medicaments applied thereto being continually kept ſo wet and moiſt that they could not ſtick cloſe enough to put forth their virtue, the bones could not be conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, nor brought to grow faſt and firm to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but they lay at a certain diſtance one from the other.</p>
                  <p>But now ſuch Fractures as theſe are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward very hardly to be cured, (unleſs it be ſo that they are new and of no long ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in which the uſual way of Curing is to be adminiſtred, and the <hi>Oſteocolla Stone</hi> to be given the Patient, as we have already ſhewn you how, and in what manner; of which very thing we finde an example in <hi>Guilhelmus Fabricius</hi> his <hi>third Cent. Obſervat.</hi> 90.) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that a <hi>Callus</hi> is drawn over the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the broken bones, by reaſon of which the bones can no more be brought to grow together. Yet ſome there are that think that ſuch inveterate Fractures as theſe may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be Cured. And <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> (in his 8. <hi>B.</hi> and 10. <hi>Chapt.</hi>) writeth of them, in theſe very words. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Fracture (to wit, of the bones that grow not well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) be inveterate, the Member is then to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="2748" facs="tcp:49110:216"/> that it may be ſomthing hurt. The bones are with the Hand to be divided one from the other, that by coming together again they may be exaſperated; ſo that if there be any thing fat, it may by this means be taken away, and that it may wholly become new as it were: and yet great care ought here to be had that the Nerves and Muſcles be not hurt. And then the Member is to be fomented with Wine in which Pomegranate Rinds have been boyled; and the ſame is likewiſe to be laid on mingled with the white of an Egge. The third day it is to be looſened, and fomented with Water in which Vervein hath been boyled. On the fifth day the like is to be done; and Splinters are to be placed round about it. And as for all the reſt that is to be done (both before and after) it is the very ſame that we wrote before.</hi> But this way of Curing is very dangerous, and (which <hi>Celſus</hi> himſelf likewiſe feareth) by thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nerves and Muſcles may eaſily be hurt; and thereupon an Inflammation or Convulſion excited.</p>

                  <p>ANd thus much (in general) may ſuffice to have been ſpoken touching Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. But now becauſe that the bones which are broken are various, and in regard that according to the variety of the broken bones the Cure doth ſomthing differ, we ſhal now therefote ſpeak ſomthing of Fractures in their ſpecies, and particularly. But as for the reſt of the differences, in regard that they make very little or nothing at all either for the knowledg or Cure; and that all that may be ſaid of them is conteined in thoſe things which we have hitherto ſpoken of Fractures in general; we ſhall therefore paſs them over, and ſhall treat only of thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that are taken from the ſubject, and the diverſity of thoſe broken bones. And becauſe that very frequently the Arm, Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Leg, and Thigh, are broken, we ſhall therefore in the firſt place ſpeak of them; and afterwards we intend to treat like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Fractures of the reſt of the bones.</p>
                  <p>And indeed as touching the Fracture of the Arm,<note place="margin">The Fracture of the Arm:</note> in regard that the Arm together with the Hand is the Organ or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of laying hold on things, and of many labors, and is likewiſe expoſed unto exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal injuries, it is wont to be often bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <p>Now the Arm, or that part which is from the Shoulder to the Wriſt, conſiſteth of two bones; of which the greater that lieth lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is called <hi>Cubitus</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna;</hi> but the leſs which lieth above the Elbow is termed <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius.</hi> Now ſomtimes both theſe bones are broken, and ſomtimes but only one of them.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The Fracture of the Arm is more eaſily Cured when but only one of the bones is broken, then when they are both broken; as we told you above, in the <hi>firſt Chapt.</hi> and <hi>ſixth Prognoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. If only one of theſe Arm-bones be broken, the Cure is more eaſie; if the upper bone, (or <hi>Radius</hi>) then if the lower bone (or <hi>Cubitus</hi>) be broken; for the upper needeth leſs extenſion then the lower: and if the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, (to wit, the <hi>Cubitus</hi>) be preſerved ſound, it ſerveth inſtead of a <hi>Baſis</hi> and prop as it were, to keep the broken bone from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved out of its place. And Secondly, Becauſe that it is more eaſie to be ſet in its place again; unleſs it be in that part next the Hand. And thirdly, Becauſe that the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow bone being kept ſafe and ſound, it is carried more ſafely in the Scarf or Linen Swathe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But the worſt Fracture of all is, if both the bones be broken together. For firſt of all, they have no prop, nor any thing at all to ſuſtain them. And then again Secondly, They need a greater Extenſion; ſince that the Nerves and Muſcles are more contracted toward the place from whence they ſpring; in regard that there is nothing whereby (when they are extended) they may be ſo kept. And Thirdly, becauſe that the neer neighbouring parts a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e more hurt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But now the bones of the Arm are for the moſt part made to grow together within thirty daies; although (as we ſaid before) there may be great difference in the Age, and Nature of the Patients.</p>

                     <p>Whatſoever things they are that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the Curing of the Fractures of the other parts, they are here likewiſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But as for the Extenſion, there is leſs need of ſtrength and force when the <hi>Radius</hi> is broken, then when the <hi>Cubitus</hi> or Elbow is broken: but the greateſt need of all, when both the bones are broken. And indeed, if both the bones are broken, the Extenſion that is made ought to be equal; but if only one of the two bones be broken, the greateſt and ſtrongeſt Extenſion ought to be in that part where the bone is broken. The Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being made, the broken bone is again to be directed into its proper place, and there
<pb n="2749" facs="tcp:49110:216"/> ſet faſt. The broken bone being thus repla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the Fracture (as we told you before) is in a convenient manner to be bound up and rowled about with Swathes; and all other things are here to be performed that were before ſpoken of in the Cure of a Fracture in general; and then at length the Arm is to be fitly placed and Scituaced. And indeed (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adviſeth in his <hi>firſt B. of Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Text</hi> 22.) in the placing thereof there is great care to be had, that the Hand be not lower then the Elbow; leſt that if the Arm hang down the Blood ſhould flow toward the Fracture; but ſomthing (and not much) higher then the Elbow; and yet nevertheleſs ſo that no pain at al may be cauſed. And the Arm is alſo to be placed in that Figure, which may not in the leaſt pervert any of the Muſcles, and breed pain. And therefore the Arm is neither to be wholly extended, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought it to be wholly doubled and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed together: neither is it likewiſe to be placed in a Supine or Prone manner. For theſe are the four extreme habits; and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is contrary unto bending and crooking; and ſo is Supine alſo contrary unto Prone. But now, there are alſo two other manners; one that betwixt extreme bending and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion (called <hi>Angularis</hi> by <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) the other between prone and ſupine. And alwaies, if the Arm be rightly placed, the Muſcles that ariſe in the fore part of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow will be wholly Scituated from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior part; and thoſe that are from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior part will likewiſe be conteined in this; and ſo there will not be at all any extenſion or perverſion of the Muſches. And indeed, the Arm being thus bound up and Scituated, it will be very fit that the ſick perſon keep himſelf in his bed for ten daies. But after this, in regard that the ſick perſon will not be willing any longer to keep his bed, but wil now deſire to walk about; from the Neck the Arm is to be hung in a broad and ſoft Garter or Scarf, equally ſuſtaining within it good part of the Arm, with part of the Palm of the Hand, ſo, that none of the bones that are ſet and joyned together may by any means be moved out of their places.</p>

That this may be the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, there will firſt of all be need of Extenſion; which how it ought to be done in this Caſe, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath accurately deſcribed in his 2 <hi>B. of Fractures,</hi> and <hi>Offic. Medic.</hi> The Sum of all is this; that the ſick perſon either ſitting or lying along be kept ſo ſteady and immoveable, that he may not be ſtirred ſo as to give ground in the Extenſion of the part: and let the Shoulder be kept in about the upper part of it, and the broken bone drawn this and that way. Now if this cannot be done (in thoſe that are of ful and ripe age) by the help of the Hands alone (by reaſon of the thickneſs and ſtrength of the Muſcles in that place) then there wil be need of Engines and Cords; of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in the <hi>place alleadged</hi>) maketh mention. The Extenſion being performed, the bones are conveniently to be ſet and placed together; which may here be done without any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Unto the broken bones ſet right and ſtraight fit Medicaments (touching which we have ſpoken before, in the firſt Chapt.) are to be laid on; and afterward Swathes are to be caſt about it, beginning from the Fracture it ſelf: and here we are to be very heedful, that the Member be evermore bound up in that Figure in which it ought to remain; that is, that the Elbow with the Shoulder may make a right Angle, leſt that in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Scituation the Swathe preſs too cloſe in one part, &amp; be overlooſe in another, and ſo the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But we muſt have a care that theſe Splinters touch not the extremities of the Joynts; and therefore (as <hi>Celſus</hi> in his 8. <hi>B.</hi> and 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> telleth us) they ought on the outſide to be very long, ſomwhat ſhorter from the brawn of the Arms, but ſhorteſt of all under the wing of the Shoulder. But if the Splinters be inſtantly faſtened on at the very firſt of all (according to the practiſe of ſome, and indeed moſt of the Modern Artiſts) they ought then to be tied on but looſely; but then after the ſeventh and nineth day they are afterward to be looſened, and bound on ſomthing harder. And then in
<pb n="2750" facs="tcp:49110:217"/> the laſt place the Member is rightly to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and that the Shoulder may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and turned awry, let the broad Swathe that encompaſſeth the Shoulder be drawn in a round manner about the Breaſt; and when the Shoulder ought to reſt, let the firſt many times wrapped about be caſt and drawn under betwixt the ſide and the Elbow, leſt that the Shoulder touch upon the ſide; but yet let there be a ſpace in the middle, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when the Shoulder is forced by the Reins drawing it into the breaſt, it may not at all be depraved and diſordered.

Now it conſiſteth of two bones: of which that which is the thicker, and is Scituated in the inward part of the Leg we call <hi>Tibia</hi> or the Shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone; but the thinner and outward bone is termed <hi>Fibula.</hi> Now theſe bones are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſomtimes both of them together, and ſomtimes but only one of them; and the Fracture happeneth either in the midſt, or in the upper, or in the nether part.</p>

                     <p>If both the bones be broken, this is moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily known; becauſe that the whole Leg may then be bowed and bended. And it is likewiſe no hard matter to know the Fracture of the ſhinbone, if it be wholly broken; becauſe that this whole bone cometh eaſily to be ſeen as being in a place where there is but little or no fleſh. But if the <hi>Fibula</hi> only be broken, this is not ſo eaſily known, becauſe that it is covered with much fleſh; and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the broken part inclineth inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. If the Shin-bone be broken, it is very hardly Cured; becauſe that there is here need of a greater Extenſion; and the ſick perſon is much longer ere he dare adventure to walk.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But now theſe bones for the moſt part are conſolidated within fourty daies, and very ſeldom ſooner.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>And therefore, whether only one, or both the bones be broken, the Leg is (as much as may be) to be extended; that ſo the bones without any damage at all may again be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto their own places, and there joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together. Which moſt commonly is to be done by two ſtrong able men; who are to draw the Leg toward them, they ſtanding on both ſides of the ſame; one into the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part, and the other into the inferior part. And it will be but a Vain-glorious act in them to make uſe of any kind of Engines, when the Caſe doth not require it. But if they cannot accompliſh it otherwiſe, let them then make uſe of the Reins and Engines that we ſo often have deſcribed, and which are ſo generally well known. And when the Leg ſhall be ſufficiently extended, the broken bones are then to be ſetled in their places. And afterward convenient Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be impoſed; and the Leg is then to be rowled and wrapt about with Swathes, (as in general we have already told you;) which ought to be both broader and longer then in the Arm: and the Leg is ſo altogether to be Scituated and compoſed, that it may not be turned awry unto any part; and that the broken bones may not be diſordered when he goeth to his bed, or to eaſe Nature. Touching the Scituation of the Shank or Shin-bone, ſee likewiſe further hereof in <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> his 1. <hi>Centur. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat.</hi> 93. And at length the Leg when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and ſtretched forth ſtraight, is to be placed upon a Cuſhion, or ſome other ſoft and plain thing, and ſo the Splinters and Pipes are then to be adminiſtred as in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral we told you before, in the <hi>firſt Chapter;</hi> in which thing we are to obſerve, that they be not applied upon the extremities of the bones ſticking out; or upon that Tendon which tendeth and paſſeth along from the Leg unto the Foot, and is there knit unto the Heel. For theſe parts having in them a very exquiſite ſenſe will not endure compreſſion; but if they be preſſed together they are then pained and inflamed.</p>
                     <p>And there is here alſo ſomtimes need of blood-letting, and purging, as in the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Arm.</p>

                     <p>As for matter of Dyet, we ought altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more and longer to extenuate the body of the Patient (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> commandeth) when the Legg, then when the Arm is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; by how much that is greater and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then this; and becauſe there is alſo a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that the body ſhould reſt, and lye ſtill.</p>

                  <p>THe Thigh bone of all the bones in the body of man is abſolutely the biggeſt, thickeſt, and longeſt; and this may alſo chance to be broken, either in the midſt, or in the Excremityes thereof, and the places neer adjoyning.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Touching the Fracture of the Thigh <hi>Celſus</hi> in his eighth Book and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus: <hi>If the Thigh be broken, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be made ſhorter; becauſe that it never more returneth into its old place. But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there is much more weakneſs in the Thigh, where the Negligence of fortune is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe added unto the fracture.</hi> Which opinion of <hi>Celſus</hi> is (according to <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cettus</hi> in his fourth Book,<note place="margin">Whether the Fracture of the Thigh do neceſſarily cauſe lameneſs.</note> 
                        <hi>Chapt.</hi> 24.) thus to be underſtood by us not that by no means the broken bones may be reſtored unto their wonted ſeat in the Thigh, and there be wel ſitted together, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Thigh bone muſt neceſſarily be ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but when the part is leſs diſtended then need requireth, and when the bones are not wel and moſt exactly ſet and ſitted together: ſince that we ſee from day to day Many who have ſuffered a Fracture of the Thigh (it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been wel faſtned together with Iron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments) have yet walked ſtraight &amp; upright without any lameneſs at al. And the very ſame we are taught by <hi>Avicen, Book</hi> 4. <hi>fen.</hi> 5. <hi>tract.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. by <hi>Guido</hi> de <hi>Cauliac.</hi> in his 5 <hi>tract.

But <hi>Guilhelm. Fabricius</hi> (in his 5. <hi>Cent.</hi> and 86. <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>) writeth that he never ſaw nor knew any that after this kind of Fracture eſcaped without a lameneſs, beſides one young Mayd only, unto whom he adminiſtred a new and peculiar kind of Cure. And this eſpecially happeneth if the Thigh be broken nigh unto the Hip. And of this kind of Fracture the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors alleadged are to be underſtood: But if the Thigh bone be broken toward the knee or in the midſt, &amp; that there be diligence uſed &amp; care taken in the curing thereof, the fracture may then be healed without any great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or lameneſs. But that if the ſayd thigh bone be broken toward the Hip, lameneſs for the moſt part followeth, theſe are the cauſes, as <hi>Guilhelmus Fabricius</hi> reckoneth them up. The firſt is this, becauſe that the Thigh bone is not ſtraight, as the shin and Arm bones are, but that it is naturally dilated into the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part, as it were into a bow: wherefore if it ſhal chance at any time to be broken it is eaſily bowed and bended toward the inward part: but then toward the external part it buncheth forth as it were into a bow. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there are preſent the greateſt and ſtrongeſt Nerves and Muſcles from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the Thigh, which ſo ſoon as the bone is broken they drawing, the ſaid bone (which as we have ſaid was now before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally bowed) toward their original, (to wit, the place where they have their firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) do eaſily and in ſuch a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed draw it into a bow, that the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes thereof about the Fracture do disjoyn themſelves, and ſtick forth toward the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part. Thirdly, becauſe that it is but one only bone, wherefore it is not ſo eaſily to be detained in its own place, as if it had ſome other bone adjoyned with it, as the shin and the Arms have. Fourthly, becauſe that the part is very fleſhy, and the bone ſituated as it were in the midſt of a pillow, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth us that it can very hardly be kept in its own proper place by the benefit of the ſplinters, and the <hi>Splema</hi> Coverings; and eſpecially if the Fracture be made oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For thoſe very ſtrong Nerves and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles do again (notwithſtanding that they were from the very firſt rightly ſet and repla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) draw the bones out of their proper places. But yet nevertheleſs, if any one wil follow that Method propounded by <hi>Guilhelm. Frabricius</hi> himſelf, he writeth that it may very eaſily be avoided, that the Leg ſhal not at al become ſhorter, or that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lameneſs follow thereupon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Thigh will at length in fifty days be brought to grow together again, and to be Conſolidated, and not ſooner; in regard that (as I ſayd before) it is the greateſt of all the bones, and therefore requireth the longer time, that the <hi>Callus</hi> may be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by which it is brought to grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <p>The Thigh bone being broken, if the bones be removed out of their places, there will then be need of a very
<pb n="2752" facs="tcp:49110:218"/> ſtrong and forcible extenſion; ſince that the Muſcles that encompaſs about the Thigh are the greateſt of all the reſt, ſo that theſe ſtrong Muſcles (when they are contracted toward the place of their original) may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily overcome and maſter thoſe bonds by which the Extenſion is made: which if it ſhould ſo be, the Leg is thereby rendered ſhorter; which is altogether a great defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and very much inconvenient. For although the Arm be ſomwhat ſhorter, yet it may be concealed, neither wil there be any great hurt thereby; but the Thigh if it be made ſhorter it unavoidably cauſeth a lameneſs, and unſeemly halting.</p>
                     <p>There being made a ſufficient extenſion, the Muſcles (being of all other the ſtrongeſt) do eaſily draw up the lower part of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bone unto the upper parts. But now nevertheleſs that this may the more rightly and decently be done, (a ſufficient extenſion being made by the parts of the Palms ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, as in al other Fractures) let the bone be ſet directly ſtraight, and ſo preſſed cloſe together. And afterward, let a Neceſſary and fit Medicament be impoſed thereon, and the Fracture conveniently be bound up: and here it wil not be amiſs to cut in pieces ſome linen Clothes, and to wrap them round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout upon the Hip, and neer the <hi>Ilia</hi> Guts, as likewiſe the Groins, and that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Arſe and the Genitalls; as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſes, ſo likewiſe more eſpecially for this, to wit, that the external Splinters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not the naked part.</p>
                     <p>The Pipe that is fitted unto the Thigh ought either to take in the whole Thigh,<note place="margin">The Pipe of what kind it muſt be.</note> or elſe not at al by any means to be adminiſtred. For if the Pipe that is fitted thereto be any whit ſhorter then that it reach even unto the Ham, and beyond it, it will bring more hurt then help thereunto: for it cannot be prevented, but that upon the motion of the body, or the Legg, the Thigh alſo muſt be moved. The Pipe will alſo be very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto the Ham, and it will ſuffer the Knee to be bowed. And therefore if any bend the Knee, there is a Neceſſity that the Thigh bands be likewiſe therewithal moved, and the Muſcles figured in this and that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the broken bones moved out of their places. And therefore it ſeemeth to be the moſt expedient courſe, that the Thigh be al of it conveyed into the ſayd <hi>Canalis</hi> or Pipe, which is to reach from the Hip even almoſt as low as the Foot. But now this Pipe is at a fitting diſtance to be bound on with many bands both unto the Thigh and Legg; and on both ſides woollen Clothes are to be applyed, that ſo the Member may not decline unto either part; and this is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be done, that ſo the whole foot, (to wit, the Thigh with the Legg and foot) may lye a long ſoftly and without pain; but yet ſo firmly, that the ſick perſon may not either through impatience, or whileſt he ſleepeth, move the ſame.</p>
                     <p>For it is to be obſerved, (as well in the Fracture of the Thigh as of the Legg) that the bottom of the heel be kept in as much as may be, and rightly placed: for if the foot hang down, and the reſt of the Legg be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and propped up, there is a Neceſſity then that the bones ſhould be ſeen to ſtick out in the fore-part of the foot: but if the Heel be placed higher then what is Juſt &amp; fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (the reſt of the Body being gently lifted up,) the bone in the fore part of the Legg will neceſſarily ſhew it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>elf more flat then what is Juſt and meet; and this ſo much the more, if the Mans heel be naturally greater then ordinary.</p>
                     <p>And this is likewiſe (in the Fracture of the Thigh and Legg) to be taken notice of, that if by reaſon of the ſwathes, or the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on too hard of the ſplinters, or elſe from any other cauſe, there ariſe in the Ham, or the parts beneath it, a ſwelling greater then what might Juſtly be expected; then that which is too ſtreight and cloſe, &amp; preſſeth the part too much, is to be looſned; but the ſwoln part is to be fomented or anoynted with thoſe things that have in them a virtue of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging pain, as alſo of digeſting and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driving back the humor; ſuch as the moiſt and oyly wool, throughly wet in wine and oyl; or the like Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>But yet Nevertheleſs, (as already hath been ſayd) in regard that although this cure ſhould in this manner be accompliſhed, lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and halting doth for the moſt part fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon; therefore <hi>Guilhelm. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius</hi> (in the place alleadged) propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a new and artificial way and Method of Curing the Fractures of the Thigh, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by an example; and withal he writeth that he had reduced the way of curing the Fracture of the Thigh (which hath alwaies hitherto been accounted moſt difficult) unto that facility, that even any Novice or young Practitioner may without any heſitation or doubting cure ſuch a like Fracture, if he wil but uſe a little diligence, and be but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of fit Inſtruments.

                  <p>ANd theſe bones, to wit, of the Legg, Thigh, Arm, and ſhoulder, are thoſe that are more frequently broken then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>And firſt of all, as touching the Fracture of the Noſe;<note place="margin">The Fracture of the Noſe</note> this may happen many ways, as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> teacheth us, in his Second Book of the Joynts, and 37. <hi>Text.</hi> For either a part of it may be broken off, and yet notwithſtanding the Noſe it ſelf is ſtil kept that it neither hang downward, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be turned and made to ſtand awry, or that either of theſe ſhould happen; and this either in that part that is Griſtly, and ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth; or elſe in the reſt of it which is kept and held together with bones. And ſomtimes alſo even in the very midſt of the Noſe (where it is ſharp) the fleſh neer unto the bone is bruiſed and battered, or the bone is likewiſe ſomwhat hurt, but yet not much: and now and then alſo a wound happeneth unto the Fracture.</p>

                     <p>If therefore the broken Noſe be equally beaten down unto the inferior part, and be rendered flat; then ſomething is to be put into the Noſethrils that may ſet it up ſtraight again, as the Probe or ſearching inſtrument, or the inſtrument they call <hi>Spatha:</hi> or elſe that which is broken is to be lifted up with the finger thruſt up into the Noſethrils, and ſo to be reſtored unto its Natural ſituation, and place. And outwardly likewiſe we ought on both ſides to lay hold on the Noſe, and to draw it upward.</p>
                     <p>But then, that the bones of the Noſethrils (that are again brought unto their wonted form and figure) may be preſerved in their Natural ſeat, either Liniments folded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the ſhavings of Linen (commonly called Lint) or elſe ſome ſuch like thing wrapt up in the Linen, or Leather, or a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or ſilver pipe covered over with a ſoft skin, are to be put up into the Noſethrills.</p>
                     <p>But if the noſe be broken only in one ſide of it we ought then alſo to ſet it right &amp; ſtraight (in a Convenient manner) from that part which declineth, and ſo to reſtore it unto its natural ſeat; both by thruſting in the finger, or ſome fit Inſtrument, into the Noſethrills (in that place where the Noſe is hurt; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by ſetting the Noſe ſtraight outwardly, But then, leſt that bone which is compoſed and ſet together again in its due place ſhould again be depraved, and fall down; there are to be thruſt up into the Noſethril that is hurt either Linen raggs, or a great Gooſequill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynted with a Gum, and covered over with a ſoft skin, or a pipe or plummet of Lead, or little ſtaff of ſilver, wrapped up in a ſoft Skin. Neither is it much material what it is we thruſt up into the Noſethrills; only that it be ſomthing that may keep the broken bone of the Noſe from falling down; and that it be ſomewhat that is ſofe, and free from an offenſive ſmell. Neither are ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges alſo (or the like things) to be put up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Noſethrills, in regard that by ſoaking in the Moiſture of the Noſe they become thick, and are dilated; and ſo being dilated they diſtend the part, and again move out of their places the bones after they have been wel ſet together. That which is put up ought to be anoynted with ſome emplaſtick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament, of <hi>Mannathuris</hi> or the <hi>fine flour of Frankincenſe, Gum Tragacanth, Maſtick and oyl of Roſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the Noſe be broken, and writhed in an oblique manner neer unto the Griſtle, then we muſt agglutinate unto the Noſe (in that part into which it inclineth) a little loop or fillet (of a fingers bredth) with that kind of Glew which we mentioned before, touching the dry future or ſtretching in Wounds; and afterward it is to be ſtretched forth, as much as ſhall be thought fit, that ſo the Noſe may be ſet ſtraight again. But let this fillet be ſo long, that it may afterward being drawn below the Ear be drawn likewiſe about the Head: and as for the two ends thereof, we may agglutinate them unto the forehead. For this Rein will juſtly ſet ſtraight the Noſe, and it may be either ſtreyned or ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="2754" facs="tcp:49110:219"/> according as we find occaſion. And if the Tents that are put up into the Noſethrils do ſtir up and cauſe any pain, they are to be taken from thence; and all this while the Noſethrils are to be kept ſtraight with the Reins aforeſaid. But after the fourteenth day the Reins are to be removed, and a Cerot to be laid on, and care taken that the <hi>Callus</hi> do not grow forth more then what is juſt and fit.</p>
                     <p>If the bones of the Noſe ſhall be broken and ſhattered into ſmal pieces; we are then (as much as may be) to put them all, and each particular of them, back into its proper ſeat; or elſe they are to be driven back by Inſtruments fit for that purpoſe; neither muſt we eaſily admit of the taking forth of any bone, and not at all, if it may by any means be agglutinated, in regard that it breedeth deformity. And afterward ſome Cerot or ſome other Medicament is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, for the confirming and ſtrengthening of the bones.</p>
                     <p>If a Wound ſhal happen with the Fracture, then ſome Emp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Touching the binding up of theſe Fractures Authors differ much;<note place="margin">The binding up of Fractures.</note> and of theſe, ſome of them allow of theſe bindings up, but others altogether diſapprove of them. And indeed it ſeemeth altogether more ſafe wholly to omit theſe bindings up, and the Swathes; ſeeing that either they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form nothing at all, if they be looſe; or if they be harder and cloſer drawn together, they then ſet the Noſe awry, and make it flat; and very eaſily may the broken bones of the Noſe be kept faſt in their places by convenient Emplaſters, without any binding up at all. And in no other caſe doth this binding ſeem convenient, but only in this, if in the middle of the Noſe (where it is ſharp) the fleſh be bruiſed about the bone, and the bone ſtick forth; that ſo the Noſe being preſſed together in that part may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire its own Natural Figure again. But here alſo, as for binding, although it ſeem alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary, and very profitable: yet nevertheleſs we deny it to be at all neceſſary, ſince that a Cerot or an Emplaſter may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And if at al it be requiſite to apply the Swathe, it is to be caſt upon the middle of the Noſe, and both the ends thereof are to be tied together at the hinder part of the Head.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>If the Jaw Bone be ſo broken tranſverſly, that yet notwithſtanding the bones ſtick to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether one to the other in any part, we ought with the Fingers on both ſides (to wit, as wel thoſe that are put up into the Mouth, as thoſe that are outwardly applied) to preſs the bone together, and ſo to force it into its own ſeat again. But that the Jaw Bone is again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into its own place, appeareth by the equality and evenneſs of it, and of the Teeth.</p>
                     <p>But if the whole Jaw bone be broken in a tranſverſe manner (which nevertheleſs very ſeldom happeneth) and ſo that indeed bone ſtick out upon bone, and that one Tooth ſtand out upon the next Tooth unto it, then by putting the Fingers into the Mouth, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by applying the Hand externally, the broken bones are to be ſet in their places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and unleſs it may be done by a ſingle &amp; ſimple compreſſion, there ought firſt of al an extenſion to be made (the Phyſitian exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it before, and ſome aſſiſtant that help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him keeping of it back) and afterward the bones ought to be ſet and Joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is a ſign that the Jaw bone is rightly ſet and replaced, if we ſee that the Teeth are
<pb n="2755" facs="tcp:49110:219"/> again reſtored and diſpoſed of unto their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Natural Scituation.</p>
                     <p>The Teeth which have been moved and looſned in their holes are with a Thread of Gold, Silver, or Iron, to be Joyned and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto thoſe that ſtand next them; until they ſhall again become firm and ſtable in their places.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being thus performed, ſome Medicament that is fit and proper for the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is outwardly to be applied unto the Jaw bone, that ſo the broken bones being now ſet together again may be firmly faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their ſeats; and externally we are to apply a Splinter of Leather or ſome other convenient matter, anſwering in length unto the Jaw bone. And after this a ſit conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient binding is to be inſtituted; which is done with a Swathe ſlit at both ends, two Fingers broad, and in the middle part of it cut alſo long waies, that it may on both ſides take in, and contain the Chin. And therefore there being four Heads of the Swathe thus ſlit at both ends, the two lower of them are to be brought and drawn along unto the top of the Head, and there to be tied together or ſewed unto the ſick perſons night Cap; but the two uppermoſt are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly to be drawn unto the loweſt part of the Head behind; or elſe to be ſewed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unto the ſame night Cap.</p>
                     <p>Let not the ſick perſon lie upon the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Jaw-bone, but upon that Jaw-bone that is ſound and unbroken; and yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs let him not reſt himſelf thereon, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his Head, leſt that the Jaw bone that is ſet in its place be again diſtorted and made to ſtand a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ry. Let the Jaw likewiſe be kept immoveable; and therefore let not the Patient ſpeak much, neither chew hard Meats, but let him be nouriſhed with Food that is ſoft and moiſt, until the <hi>Callus</hi> be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened. If any thing ſhall be obſerved to be again removed out of its place, on the third day the binding is to be looſened; and if any thing be fallen out, it is again to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed.</p>

                     <hi>HIppocrates</hi> (in his <hi>B. of the Joynts, Text</hi> 62.) reckoneth up ſix Differences of the Fracture of the Channel bone. For either this bone is broken in a tranſverſe manner, or elſe long waies. If tranſverſly, this happeneth either neer unto the Joynt of the Shoulder; or elſe it is broken more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the breaſt bone; and furthermore, the Throat bone is either ſo broken, that that part which is from the breaſt is carried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but that part which is from the top of the broad bone of the Shoulder is carried downward; and this very often (and for the moſt part) happeneth: or elſe on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that part nigh unto the Shoulder blade is carried upwards; but that which is neer unto the Breaſt is carried downward; and this very rarely happeneth.</p>
                  <div type="diagnosis">
                     <head>Signs Diagnoſtick.</head>
                     <p>Now this Fracture of the Channel bone is known rather by the touch, then by the ſight; as alſo by the pain.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="prognosis">
                     <head>Prognoſticks.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. If the Channel bone be broken tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, it is the more eaſily Cured; if long waies, it is the harder to be Cured. For that which is tranſverſly broken may eaſily (by extenſion, and the compreſſion of the Fingers) be brought to return unto its Natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſeat; but the other Fracture (that is in the length of the bone) hath evermore ſomthing that ſticketh out, which can very hardly be fitted together. And then again, becauſe that the Throat bone cannot be ſo wrapped round about with the Swathe, that what is cleft and broken in the length of the Bone may be again compelled into its own ſeat; but on the contrary, that which is broken tranſverſly is more eaſily by the Ligature to be forced back into its own ſeat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Fracture of the Throat doth indeed nothing at all hurt the Commiſſure of the Shoulder, or any other part: and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs becauſe that (although the utmoſt diligence ſhall be uſed) the Neck and the Throat cannot (as the Arms and the Legs) be cloſely wrapped about with the Swathe, the <hi>Callus</hi> therefore leaveth a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; becauſe that in a thin bone the <hi>Callus</hi> doth eaſily become greater: but it is only in the beginning that it ſeemeth defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, while it is yet new; but in proceſs of time, when we are once accuſtomed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the deformity ſeemeth the leſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But the Throat-bone doth eaſily grow together again, like as do other thin bones; and indeed in twenty daies at the very utmoſt it is Ferruminated.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>But now that this Fracture may be Cured, there are neceſſarily required two able aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, for the extenſion of this Fracture; of which, let the one with both Hands draw back unto the hinder part the Shoulder that lieth neer unto the broken Channel bone;
<pb n="2756" facs="tcp:49110:220"/> and let the other quite contrary draw rather toward him the oppoſite Shoulder, or the oppoſite part of the Neck; that ſo the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be made. Which ſo ſoon as it is done, let the Chirurgeon with his Fingers reſtore the broken bones unto their places again, by preſſing together with his Fingers that which ſticketh up too high, and by lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up that which is preſſed down; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> by reſtoring it back again into its Natural ſeat, in any manner whatſoever that ſhall be thought needful. Some there are, who to Facilitate the reſtitution of the bone, do put ſomthing that is round under the Arm-pit of the ſick perſon, that it may fill up the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof; and then withal they greatly preſs the Elbow unto the Ribs; and ſo by this means they again reſtore the bone unto its own place. But if the extremities of the broken bone be ſo depreſſed that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in this manner be brought back again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then the ſick perſon is again to be laid flat upon his Back upon a hard Pillow or Cuſhion put under his back-bone between the Shoulder-blades; but the Shoulders are by the ſtrength of the Hands lying upon them ſo to be preſſed down, that the extremities of the broken bone that are depreſſed may be lifted up ſo high, that they may again be reſtored unto their own Natural Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But if the Channel bone be broken and ſhattered into many ſmal pieces, and that ſome fragment thereof cauſe a pricking in the fleſh, and difficulty of breathing; then there is an inciſion to be made in that part of the fleſh, and the fragments to be taken forth; or the ſharp pricks are to be cut and ſhaved off; and the bones when they are made plain muſt be joyned together; the Lips of the Wound are likewiſe to be drawn cloſe together, and ſome Medicament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Fracture (and which may withall reſiſt and hinder Inflammation) is to be laid on. But if there be found to be many frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the bone, (the Skin remaining en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and ſound) that yet are not ſharp, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do at all prick, then a Splinter is to be provided of Leather, or ſome other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient matter, and being anoynted with a fit Medicament it is to be applied unto thoſe fragments.</p>
                     <p>The broken Channel bones, being rightly ſet together, ſome, Medicament fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Fracture (ſuch as are above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the <hi>firſt Chapter</hi>) is to be impoſed. After this three Coverings of a convenient thickneſs and length (ſo that they may fil up the Cavity or hollowneſs both above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Channel bone) are to be provided; of the which two of them are to be put upon the ſides; but the third that is thicker is to be impoſed upon the Fracture ſticking forth. For ſo by this means both the broken bone that ſticketh out will be depreſſed, and the broken bones ſo kept in, that they ſhall not be moved either upward or downward; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall theſe broken bones (being once ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> together) be removed out of their proper places unto the ſides. And after this a right binding up is to be inſtituted, which may be done with a Swathe as broad as the Palm of the Hand (or four Fingers breadth) of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient length, having a double Head; it is to be made Croſs wiſe, in the form of the Letter X; which is rather to be often drawn about the place of the Fracture, then that the ſaid Fracture ſhould be too cloſe and hard bound; and it is ſo to be rowled about, that it may draw the Arm unto the hinder parts. And the Cavity alſo under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit neer unto the part affected is to be filled up with Linen Clothes folded together. For ſo the ſick party will the better and more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily endure the binding. The ſick perſon muſt alſo be ordered to take his reſt, and to keep himſelf as quiet as he can; and he himſelf is to bend back his Arm toward the hinder parts. But ler not the Swathe be looſened before the ſeventh day, unleſs an Itching, or ſome ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Cauſe require it: and if it be from day to day to be looſened, it may likewiſe be daily drawn a little cloſer and harder to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. If the Fracture be in the Neck of the Shoulder blade, or in the dearticulation of the Shoulder, it is then hardly ever to be healed. For in regard that neer about this Joynt there are the Veins, and Arteries of the Arm-pits, and the Nerves ariſing from the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck behinde, an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and moſt grievous Symptoms do happen.</p>

                     <p>If the broken bone adhere ſtill unto the Shoulder-blade, it is then by the Chirurgeons Hand to be reſtored back again into its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place. But if this may not eaſily be done, and that there be need of more force and ſtrength, then a bal of Linen may be put under the Arm-pit, and let the aſſiſtant draw the ſhoulder downward, by drawing about the Elbow unto the Ribs; but let the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon himſelf with his Hand preſs down the Fracture, and ſet the bone that is broken. But if the broken bone do not cohere with the Shoulder blade, but that it only yet hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereunto by the Ligaments and the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſtium,</hi> and that it exciteth no great danger by pricking, it is then alſo to be reſtored even unto its own place again.

                     <p>But if the Ribb be wholly broken, and yet the broken extremityes thereof not moved out of their places, by being either driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or forced into the Exterior part, there are but very few that are hereupon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a fever.

                     <p>But if the Ribb be both wholly broken, and the extremityes thereof moved out of their places, there is then a certain inequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or unevenneſs, and Cavity, that may be both diſcovered by the ſight, as alſo by the touch; and there is likewiſe a certain ratling noyſe heard: unto which alſo there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other ſymptoms Joyned. There is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a very great and grievous pain, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the internal part of the Ribb be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; (and this pain much reſembleth the pain of ſuch as have the Pleuriſy) the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is very difficult, the Cough extremely troubleſom; and now and then likewiſe ſpitting of blood followeth thereupon (the Lungs ſoaking in the blood flowing forth of the broken veſſells) and a feaver is alſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall joyned, and accompanyeth the ſame. But more eſpecially two evills there are that uſually attend the Fracture of the Ribbs. The firſt whereof is, the puffing up of the fleſh lying upon the Ribb; which is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered both by the touch and ſight; and if the place be preſſed together with the hand, there is heard a certain noyſe and ſound of the Air going forth thereof. Unto which unleſs timely Remedies be adminiſtred, (in the ſecond place) an Inflammation, and a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and an Impoſtume are wont to ſucceed. The cauſe of which thing is the ſeparation of the fleſh from the bone, and a weakneſs brought upon the part with the blow, which cannot therefore ſufficiently concoct the Aliment, that by reaſon of the pain is more abundantly attracted, and flowerh thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: which remayneth thereupon partly crude and is partly reſolved into vapours and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulencies or windineſs. And ſomtimes the Corruption of the Ribbs is wont likewiſe to follow this Malady. For when the fleſh is ſeparated from the bone, the Air getteth in in the place thereof; by the contact and impreſſion whereof the bone is offended and corrupted.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. If the Fracture be ſingle, without any Contuſion or bruiſing of the parts lying neer thereunto, there is then little or no danger at all: and the Ribbs will grow together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain within twenty days.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if the fleſh about the Ribbs be bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and bruiſed, then the evil is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous (by reaſon of thoſe ſymptoms that as we have before told you do happen herupon) &amp; ſomtimes deadly.

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>If the whole Ribb be not broken, (or if wholly broken, yet not removed out of its proper place,) and that there be no Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the parts incumbent and lying neer, then ſome gentle Medicament that is fit and Convenient for a fracture and inflammations, is to be layd on, of <hi>Frankincenſe, ſine flour Bole Armenick, the White of an Egge,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>But if the broken Ribb ſtick forth outwardly it is to be preſſed together with the hand, and to be reduced unto its Natural ſituation: and here alſo a Convenient Medicament is to be impoſed.</p>
                     <p>But if the broken Ribb tend inwardly, we muſt endeavor that it may be brought back into its own place. And therefore we muſt firſt of all ſee whether by the Cough, and the holding of the breath, or by the help of the hands the broken Ribb may be reſtored again into its own place: which if it ſucceed not, then we muſt lay on ſome Emplaſter that will attract, and that will ſtick faſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ribb; and then this Emplaſter is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with violence to be taken away, that ſo the Ribb may be brought back again into its own place.</p>
                     <p>And very Convenient for this uſe is this Emplaſter alſo.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>The fineſt wheat flour two ounces; Tragacanth, &amp; Frankincenſe powdered, of each five drams; Miſsleto of the Oake, (to wit, the Glew) ſix drams; Ichthyocolla or Fiſh Glue one ounce and half; Whites of Eggs two ounces; Roſe-water as much as will ſuffice; and mingle them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or an Emplaſter made of <hi>Turpentine, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, blackpitch, Barly Meal, or Beanmeal, Maſtick, and Aloes.</hi> And ſuch like emplaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as theſe are often to be applyed, and then to be taken off when the ſick perſon ſhall breathe more freely. And I my ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member likewiſe that ſome yeers ſince a certain Cooper having a Ribb broken and depreſſed in his right ſide by the violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyling of a hoop, which he was bending to make a hoop for a Hogſhead, or tub, (ſo that he could very hardly draw his breath) Coughed extremly, and was not able to lift himſelf up ſtraight. I applyed and layd on ſuch an Emplaſter as this that we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and thereby brought back the Ribb again into its proper place.</p>
                     <p>Some there are indeed who endeavor the bringing back of the broken Ribbs into their places again by the applying of Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes: but Moſt Phyſitians diſlike this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, there being great cauſe to fear leſt that by this means there be more of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor attracted: and that otherwiſe the fleſh above the Ribbs is wont to be puffed up. But if any broken fragment of the Ribb prick the Membrane, ſo that thereupon moſt grievous pains and other ill ſymptoms ariſe, (in ſo much that there be great cauſe to fear death) that part wherein the Ribb is broken is to be opened with the inciſion knife, that ſo we may the better come at the fragments that prick, either to pluck them forth, or to cut them off. And if likewiſe there be preſent any contuſion or bruiſe, a vein is then to be opened, leſt that an Inflammation follow.</p>
                     <p>The Ribbs being reduced unto their own places again, Nature will then indeed of her own accord generate the <hi>Callus;</hi> which that we may the better aſſiſt, ſome Emplaſter that is convenient for a fracture of the bones is to be impoſed; among the which this that followeth is one of the chiefeſt.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pouder of Myrtles, and red Roſes, of each one ounce; the Meal of Barly, of the bitter vetch orobus; and of Lentiles, of Beans, and of Maſtick, of each two drams; Acron Cups, Cypreſs Nuts, (the rinds of them) Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, Dragons blood, Earth of Lemnios, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes and Myrrh, of each two drams; Oyl of Myrtle, of Roſes, and oyl omphacine, of each nine ounces; Wax and cleer Turpentine, of each half a pound; and make an Emplaſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some there are that (in the progreſs of the diſeaſe) wet and ſoak the ſwathes in Roſemary water; which (as they write) is a very ſpecial and effectual water in all frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the bones.</p>
                     <p>But if the fleſh be moyſt and flaggy, then the Medicaments before propounded are to be impoſed; and the place is to be ſtreyned together with ſwathes and other Coverings, that ſo the fleſh may again be conjoyned with the bone. And if through Negligence of the Phyſitian, or the ſick perſon himſelf, the Malady be now become old and inveterate, and that the fleſh be rendered ſoft and ſnotty (ſo that there be cauſe to fear leſt that the bones, Griſtles, and Membranes may be hurt) we are then to do our endeavour that the ſaid ſnotty Juice may be diſcuſſed by ſuch digeſting Cataplaſms as we ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſpeak of. But if this may not be done, the burning iron is the beſt Remedy; and yet here we are to be very cautious, that the bone be not made hot, or the inward parts hurt.</p>
                     <p>If that which was bruiſed tend toward a Suppuration, the Matter is then to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and evacuated with a Cataplaſm of <hi>Barly meale, Bean meal, or of the bitter vetch Orobus, Camomile flowers,</hi> and the like. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Meal of Beans and Barly, of each
<pb n="2760" facs="tcp:49110:223"/> two ounces; Wormwood, half an ounce; the pouder of Camomile flowers, Melilote, and Eldern, of each one ounce; boyl them in Spring Water; and then add Oyl of Camomile and Roſes, of each one ounce; and make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the matter cannot yet be diſcuſſed by theſe Medicaments, all delay is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, for fear leſt that the bone be vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and therefore in that part wherein it moſt ſwelleth the part is to be opened either with the Penknife, or with the hot Iron, that ſo a free paſſage forth may be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the <hi>Pus.</hi>

And he that will needs attempt it, let him be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cautious leſt that he hurt the Heads of the Muſcles, or ſome one of the principal Veſſels; or that greater Nerve which is ſtretched forth into the Muſcles of the Thigh and Leg.</p>

For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as about the whirl-bone the extremityes of the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth' Muſcles, that move the ankle and leg, run along together, and end in that moſt ſtrong Tendon that is implanted in the Whirl-bone; and that the Muſcles are wont of their own accord to be moved and drawn toward the place of their originall; therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without any great induſtry and paines, the fracture that is made long wayes may be reduced into its own place again &amp; the bones moſt cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjoyned as before; and ſo no great cauſe to fear the bunching forth of any <hi>callus,</hi> &amp; a lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs following upon this fracture. <hi>Paraeus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (in his 14 Book. and 22 Chapt.) writeth that he never ſaw any, who having this bone bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken was not lame, ſo that he halted al his life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: and this even therefore, becauſe that the Concretion of the <hi>Callus</hi> being produced, the Conſolidation doth hinder the free bending of the knee. But although this may eaſily be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as touching the tranſverſe fracture; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Guilhelmus Fabricius</hi> (in his fifth Cent. and 88 Obſervat.) hath rightly determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this is not alwayes neceſſary (eſpecially in the fracture that is made in the length of the bone) in regard that there is no neceſſity that there ſhould evermore be bred a <hi>Caſlus</hi> ſo ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, that it ſhould cauſe an impediment of the motion in the knee, and ſo conſequently a lameneſs and halting: and we may ſee that in the fractures of other bones Nature doth uſually ſo generate the <hi>Callus,</hi> and with that Neatneſs and skil, that oftentimes there ſcarcely remaineth any the leaſt ſign or token of any fracture appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and this eſpecially happeneth when the <hi>Perioſtium</hi> is whole &amp; unbroken, which retein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the matter of the <hi>Callus,</hi> that it may not grow forth overmuch, nor bunch out too far.</p>

But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his 2 Book of the Joynts) writeth that the bones of the Foot, as likewiſe of the Hand, are not at al broken, unleſs the fleſhy parts be wounded by ſomething that is very ſharp or heavy. For theſe bones being harder then ordinary, theſe things that are ſharp and very heavy, if they break theſe Bones, they leave not the Skin lying upon them whole and ſound but much bruiſed. And <hi>Paulus Aeginet.</hi> (in his 6 <hi>B Chap.</hi> 106.) writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Ankle can by no means be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; not only by reaſon of its hardneſs, but in regard that it is fenced and guarded round about.</p>

                     <head>The Cure</head>
                     <p>The Cure is almoſt one and the ſame with that of the broken bones of the Hand. To wit, there ought (in the firſt place) to be a fit extenſion; and the Bones (whether they ſtick forth unto the Superiour or the Inferior part) are to be forced back into their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeats; which may moſt fitly be done, if the ſick perſon ſtand with the broken Foot upon a plain table covered over with a wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len cloth. And then Secondly, fitting Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments (ſuch as the Fractures require) are to be adminiſtred. And Thirdly, The Foot is to be wrapt about with Swathes. And ſince that Splinters cannot conveniently be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the Foot, by reaſon of the uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the place the <hi>Splenia</hi> Coverings are to be made uſe of, and the place to be bound with Swathes, that ſo the bones being ſet in their places may be there kept. And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Scituation and placing ought to be ordered otherwiſe then in the Hands. For our Hands being given us to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Fingers (as we told you before in the 19. <hi>Chapt.</hi>) are to be placed in a Crooked Figure; but our feet being given us to ſtand upon, and to walk withal, are to be Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a ſtraight Figure, and not crooked, leſt that their Action be depraved and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                     <p>And thus much we thought good alſo brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeak touching Fractures. For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we have extant the moſt learned Books of <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> upon this very ſubject, touching Fractures and the Joynts, and the moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Comment</hi> of <hi>Galen</hi> upon them, I held it altogether needleſs and not worth while to treat more largely of them, as I ſee that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done before me: but think it fitter for me to refer the Reader unto them, if he deſire to ſee more hereof.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are very many Bones in the Body of Man which are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and joyned together after divers ſorts. But they are chiefly compoſed by a <hi>Symphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> and Articulation. A <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſis</hi> is a union of the Bones without motion: but the Conjunction by Articulation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for motion; the differences of it are chiefly two, a <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi> and <hi>Synarthroſis. Diarthroſis</hi> is with a manifeſt motion; <hi>Synar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throſis</hi> with an obſcure one, of which conſult with the Books of Anatomiſts.</p>
                  <p>When therefore the Bones which are joyned by Articulation do fal out of their place,<note place="margin">What Luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</note> the Diſeaſe is called by the Greeks <hi>Exarthrema,</hi> by the Latines a Luxation, which is the falling down of the Joynt out of its place (which is called the <hi>Acetabulum</hi> or hollow) into another place; by which voluntary motion is hindered: where by a Joynt is underſtood,<note place="margin">What a Joynt is,</note> as <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alſo do teach Artic. 1. Text. 1. not that aggregate of the two ends of the Bones joyned together, but only the head of the joynt.</p>
                  <div type="causes">
                     <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Internal Cauſes</note>But the Cauſes of a Luxation are either Internal, or External. The Internal are humors which falling down upon the joynts either do relax the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they ſuffer the Bones to fal out of their ſeats, or by filling them up do ſhorten and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract them, that they draw the heads of the bones out of their ſeats. To which haereditary defects muſt be referred, whenas Experience doth teach us, That oftentimes thoſe that have bunches in their backs do generate the like, and lame folks beget lame. But the external violent Cauſes are,<note place="margin">External</note> blows, fals, violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and the like, which can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel or draw forth the Bones from their ſeat; and that ſometimes is done even in the Birth, and the Arms or Thighs may be luxated while the Infants are drawn forth with violence by ignorant Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives; nay in the Mothers Womb Infants may have a luxation of their bones by a blow, fall, compreſſion, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems to intimate 3. <hi>de</hi> Art. 88. and 94. and 4. <hi>de</hi> Artic. Text. 2. and 3. but al cauſes of what kind ſoever do cauſe luxations either by violent diſtenſion or impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; moſt commonly a luxation is cauſed by violent impulſion, when from cauſes happening from without, as fals, jumping, blows, and the like, the bones are violently expelled out of their ſeats. Al other cauſes are to be referred to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſion, to wit, when the Cavities receiving the heads of the bones (which the Greeks cal <hi>Cotylae</hi>) are rendered either narrower, or larger and relaxt, this Cavity is made narrower, when a humor or ſome matter doth poſſeſs the boſom of the joynt and drives the bone out of its ſeat, which happens ſomtimes in pains of the joynts: but the Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is made larger or looſer when the brows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the boſom are broken, for ſo the bones may more freely wander and ſal forth; and the Articulation is made looſer alſo, when ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor doth too much mollefie and relax the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and renders the whol Articulation more looſe. The ſame happens when the Ligaments are too much diſtended or broken.</p>
                     <p>But the Bones are more and eaſier luxated in Children and young folks whoſe Ligaments are ſofter and weaker than in thoſe of riper age, whoſe Ligaments are firmer and ſtronger. It happens alſo in them whoſe bodies are waſted and have weaker Ligaments; but thoſe who are fleſhy and wel habited have not their joynts eaſily fal forth, when as the joynt is on every ſide ſtraightly girt in with ſtrong Muſcles; alſo thoſe joynts are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier luxated which are compoſed for many ſorts of motions; but thoſe which have fewer different motions do not ſo eaſily fal forth of their ſeats; thoſe joynts alſo which are contained with one Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament are more eaſily luxated than thoſe with two; the greater bones alſo are more difficultly luxated, and not unleſs by a violent cauſe; the leſſer bones more eaſily: laſt of al, ſome bones do more eaſily, ſome more hardly fal out of their places, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the Articulation, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſhal appear in particular. This muſt be obſerved in general, That the joynts which are in a plainer boſom are more eaſily luxated; but thoſe which are hid in a deeper boſom more difficultly.</p>

                     <head>The Differences.</head>
                     <p>The proper Differences are taken either from the Subject, or the Form,<note place="margin">The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from the ſubject</note> or the Efficient Cauſe. From the Subject, becauſe the bones which are luxated are joyned either by a <hi>Synarthroſis</hi> and with an obſcure motion (as when the broad bone of the ſhoulders departs from the ſhoulder bone;)
<pb n="2670" facs="tcp:49110:226"/> or the Channel Bone from the top of the broad bone of the ſhoulders, or the radius from the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow; which kind of Luxation the Arabian Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters cal a disjunction, when the bones gape as it were; or by a <hi>Diarthroſis</hi> with manifeſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Luxation is moſt properly ſo called. There is alſo a peculiar kind of Luxation, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſo called, when the Epiphyſes of the bones are pulled from the bone on which they were placed, which happens chiefly to young folks.</p>
                     <p>From the Form becauſe the Joynt ſomtimes wholly fals out of its ſeat:<note place="margin">From the Form</note> which Luxation is called by the general name <hi>Exarthrema,</hi> or Luxation; but ſomtimes it fals forth only in part, and to the brink of the boſom or hollow, which the Greeks cal <hi>Pararthrema,</hi> the Latines a Subluxation; to which kind of Luxation alſo belongs that elonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Ligaments being luxated and made longer, the joynt indeed according to the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude doth ſomtimes depart from its ſeat, yet fals not wholly out of it.</p>
                     <p>But from the variety of the Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which the joynt fals forth there are fetcht three differences chiefly:<note place="margin">From the variety of the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</note> The firſt is, if the bone which is naturally placed in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part fal out to the lower; or on the contrary The ſecond is, if that become on the right ſide which ought to be placed on the left; or on the contrary it fal from the left to the right, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cal outwardly or inwardly. The third is, if that which was placed in the fore part fal to the hinder, and on the contrary that which was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced behind fal out to the fore part; and the joynts of ſome parts may be luxated into al theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, ſome only into certain differences, not al; ſo the elbow, hand, thigh fal forth into four diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, viz. To the inward, outward, forward, backward, but cannot upward; the knee fals out into three ſcituations, viz. The inward, outward, and hinder part towards the ham; but the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the patel bone hinders its falling out to the fore part, of which ſhal be ſpoke hereafter in the Luxations of the particular parts.</p>
                     <p>The Difference is taken from the Efficient Cauſe,<note place="margin">From the Efficient Cauſe</note> becauſe the Luxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſomtimes from external Cauſes, as fals, blows, jumpings, running, and from a violent diſtorſion, extenſion, and impulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the part, but ſomtimes from internal cauſes, as while a humor ſliding into the cavity of the joynt drives it out of its place.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo certain improper Differences,<note place="margin">Improper Differences</note> or rather complications of other preternatural Affects with Luxations, as that an Inflammation, fracture, wound, or ſomwhat elſe is joyned with the Luxation.</p>

                     <p>A Joynt being fallen forth into another place is eaſily known by the ſight and touch; for there appears a Tumor in the part into which the joynt is fallen, but a hollowneſs in the place from whence the joynt is fallen; and that appears ſo much the eaſier, if the body be not very thick and fat, or the place be void of fleſh. Again, if the Luxation be perfect, that Member is made ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whenas the joynt no longer included in its Cavity, but falling out of it, is drawn upwards: yet ſomtimes the Member becomes longer, as is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſaid in particular. When then the Member luxated is alwaies unlike to the ſound one in ſcituation, figure, and longitude, we muſt alwaies compare the Member affected with the like ſound part of the ſame name, Arm with Arm, Thigh with Thigh in the ſame man; where yet we muſt obſerve, that the Member with which we compare it be found, and have no fault. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe Articulations are made for motion, if a joynt fal out of its natural ſeat it muſt needs be that the motion of the joynt is hurt; therefore where there is a ſuſpition of a Luxation, yet the motion is not hurt, we muſt conclude that there is yet no luxation made. Laſtly, becauſe a joynt falling forth of its ſeat doth compreſs the ſenſible parts into which it is fallen, as the Tendons, Nerves, Muſcles, from thence there is raiſed a pain.</p>
                     <p>And theſe are the ſigns of a perfect Luxation; but if there be only a Subluxation, the Signs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded wil either be more gentle, or ſome of them wil be wanting.</p>
                     <p>If there be a Luxation of a joynt joyned by a <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> in which the Bones do gape, it is known by the thickneſs of the Member greater than uſual, and by a greater bunching out than the heads of the bones do conſiſt of.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the Cauſes,<note place="margin">The ſigns of the Cauſes</note> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and violent are apparent by the relation of the Patient, and the Luxation proceeding from thence happen ſuddenly; but if the Luxation he by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the looſneſs of the Ligaments, it happens by degrees; and the luxated Member is moved and totters up and down with inordinate motions; and whiles the joynt is forced into its ſeat, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber indeed acquires its natural longitude, which being let alone again preſently it becomes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>Alſo if the head of the Bone luxated be thruſt with the fingers to the contrary part, it eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil back; every where about the joynt there is a Cavity begotten, that if the finger be thruſt into the joynt it eaſily goes in, no body reſiſting, as if al were empty.</p>
                     <p>When ſome <hi>Epiphyſis</hi> is pulled off from its being, it is known by the impotency of motion, and by the crackling, when they are handled and moved.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The Joynts which are dedicated to fewer differences of motions are more difficultly repla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but better contained.</p>

                     <p>The Bone luxated, and which is fallen out of its natural ſeat, ſhews a repoſition to its natural place; and this Indication is ſatisfied, and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations are cured by ſtraining and forcing them to the part oppoſite to that from whence the change is made; which replacing of the joynts fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len forth of their ſeats is called <hi>ton arthron embole,</hi> and <hi>arthrembole.</hi> But the replacing of luxated Bones is compleated three waies, either by the hands of the Chirurgeon and his Servants, which is the moſt ſimple, and is called Paleſtrical, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'twas uſed in the wreſtling places if at any time the Fencers Limbs were luxated; and 'tis convenient in ſoft bodies, and where the evil is freſh; or by ſome vulgar inſtruments the joynts are forced into their ſeats, as by the help of reins, ſwathes, ropes, ladders, ſeats, two leav'd doors, which is called the Methodical way, and is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for children, women, and the ſtronger males, and for old luxacions; or 'tis performed by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and certain ſingular engines, and 'tis called organical, and 'tis applied to ſtronger bodies and old Luxations, and altogether to thoſe which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſtored the two former waies. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch Engines ſee <hi>Hippocrates de artic. et fractur.</hi> and <hi>Oribaſius de machin:</hi> Others hold on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two waies, the Palaeſtrical, and Phyſical; and under Phyſical comprehend the Methodical and Organical.</p>
                     <p>But what way ſoever the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the luxated bone is performed,<note place="margin">How many Operations are required to the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted parts.</note> four operations are neceſſary to it, Extenſion, Replacing, Rowling, and Confirming &amp; placing of the Member reduced: for firſt of al, whenas the Muſcles are contracted, as we have ſaid of Fractures, theſe is need of extending the luxated member, which muſt be done preſently after the Luxation is made; or if the Chirurgeon be called late, when the fear of Inflammation is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and ſo far it muſt be made, that ſome free ſpace may be left between the bones,<note place="margin">Extenſion:</note> left the joynt or head of the bone be raſed, or the brows of the boſome be broken; and in the Extenſion a convenient figure of the part muſt be obſerved, and the Muſcles on one part muſt be kept whole, and not be diſtort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit, leſt the Head of the Muſcle be in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part, and the end of it in the external. But Extenſion is made either by the hands of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, or his ſervants; or with Reins, Ropes, and Swathes, or with Inſtruments and Engines, as was ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>Sufficient extenſion being made, the bone which is fallen out of its place muſt be replaced in it,<note place="margin">Replacing</note> which labor the Greeks cal <hi>Mochlia,</hi> and <hi>Mochleuſis,</hi> viz. the compulſion of the bone luxated and extended into its ſeat: but that this operation may be done right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both the nature of Articulations, and how al the bones in the body are joyned together, and the differences of Luxations ought to be known; for the Chirurgeon wil not know certainly into what place he ought to force the luxated bone, if he do not rightly know before, out of what natural place it is fallen; for the Chirurgeon ought to conſider from whence the Joynt hath firſt fallen, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="2672" facs="tcp:49110:227"/> it hath made in its fal, and whither 'tis come at laſt; and from the end of its fal, the ſame way by which it fel forth, to force it back again to the Joynt from whence it fel: as if a Joynt be fallen forth from the left towards the right, he ought to force it towards the left; if it be fallen from the right towards the left, then towards the right; that which is fallen towards the forepart muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the hinder part; that ſlipt forth to the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part towards the ſore part. And there are ſo many waies of this reduction, as there are Joynts; for example ſake, the Shoulder is one way, the Foot another, and the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> another way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into their place; and the Shoulder other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when 'tis fallen into the Arm-pit hole, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when to the fore part. But the bone muſt be forced into its place gently, and if need be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying firſt of al laxative &amp; mollefying Medicines, leſt there be a contuſion or grating of the head and boſom upon one another, or a pain or Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be cauſed; and we muſt avoid wheeling about the head of the bone, leſt it break.</p>
                     <p>But we ſhal know that the Joynt is rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, if the member and juncture recover its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural figure, longitude, and loſt motion, and it wholly agree with the like named ſound member, and the pain which was preſent before do ceaſe. There is wont alſo for the moſt part to be heard a certain crackling and ſound when the bone returns into its Cavity, but we muſt not truſt to this ſign alone, for ſomtimes there is a crackling made, and a noiſe heard by reaſon of the breaking off of the brows of the bone, which may be, when the head of the bone is ſo ſtruck againſt the brows, that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of them is broke off; and then whenas that part of the brow broken off doth ſooner get into the boſom then the Joynt, the replacing cannot be right. A crackling and noiſe alſo may be cauſed, when in a violent reducing the joynt or head of the bone hits againſt the boſom, and contuſeth it, whence the Cartilage is ſeparated from the reſt of the bone, and there is a difficulty of motion; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the other ſigns muſt be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The Joynt being reduced into its ſeat,<note place="margin">Binding:</note> the diſtention muſt be bated, and we muſt ſuffer the Muſcles to return to themſelves, and afterwards the member muſt be ſo ſtrengthened that the Joynt cannot again go out of its place; which is done almoſt after the ſame manner as in Fractures; for firſt of al before binding up be ordered, aſtringent medicines muſt be laid on, which hinder a flux of humors and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and contract the Ligaments relaxt, and ſtrengthen the part; of Bole, <hi>Sanguis Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conis,</hi> Pomegranate Pils, Pomegranate flowers, Roſes, Frankincenſe, fine Flour, and the like, mixt with the white of an Egg; if the pain be great thoſe things alſo which together with an aſtringent faculty do mitigate pain, as Oyl of Roſes, Maſtick, and the like.

But much more is this to be done in other Joynts, of al which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (Artic. 4. Text. 16. and 17.) ſaith, <hi>For in whomſoever the bones of the Leg luxated with a wound made, do wholly hang forth from the joynts of the foot, whether they tend inwardly or outwardly, they are not to be reduced, but let them ſuffer he that wil to replace them; for ye may know, that if they remain reduced they ſhal die, and their life ſhal be of very few daies, for there are few of them which paſs the ſeventh day; for that which kills them is a Convulſion; moreover it happens alſo, that both the Leg and the Foot do gangraene.

And therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently at the beginning, and before an Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on come in a Fracture with a wound, we muſt try whether the joynt may be reſtored into its ſeat with moderate extenſion (for it can by no means endure ſtrong) which if it ſucceed to your mind we muſt labor chiefly in this to keep off an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation; but if the joynt being replaced an Inflammation or Convulſion doth happen, the joynt muſt be thtuſt out of its place again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is now ceaſed, which is wont to be about the ſeventh or ninth day, both muſt be ſignified &amp; foretold to the ſtanders by; and the danger which is at hand by the reducing, and the weakneſs of the part, by which the man is rendered lame and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med if the joynt be not reſtored: and if they urge the reſtitution of the joynt, it muſt be attempted without any violence; afterwards the Cure of the Wound muſt be ordered as in a fracture with a wound, but the member it ſelf muſt be ſo placed that the Patient (as much as may be) may be free from pain. See <hi>Hippocrates</hi> of theſe things in the place before alleadged. Somtimes alſo it happens that a Fracture is joyned with a Luxation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chirurgeon muſt be wary; and if the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture offer it ſelf neer the Joynt, let him conſider whether the Joynt be whole or luxated, leſt while he cure the Fracture he neglect the Luxation. Thus I remember a Neighbors Child, a Boy about nine yeers of age, whenas a Veſſel into which they were wont to pour their hot Drink after it was boyled, fel upon his Thigh, and his Thigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone was broke, and the Joynt of the ſame luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which when the Chirugeon obſerved not, and only Cured the Fracture and reſtored not the Hip-joynt, the Boy became lame. But if there be a luxation with a Fracture, the Member muſt be extended the common way, and the luxated Joynt muſt be reduced into its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, and the broken bones muſt be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and compoſed; and firſt of all indeed the luxated Joynt muſt be replaced if it may be done, then the Fracture muſt be Cured, and fit Medicines muſt be laid on them both, of which we have ſpoken already; and convenient binding up muſt be ordered; but if the Joynt cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to its place without danger before the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture be cured, then the Fracture muſt be cured firſt; afterward when the callus is generated, we muſt endeavor that the luxated Joynt alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>

                  <p>And firſt of al as concerning the Luxation of the Mandible; whenas Nature hath made only the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er jaw movable in al creatures, the River Crocodile excepted, (which as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> witneſſeth, 1. Hiſt. Animal. c. 11. and 3. Hiſt. Animal. c. 7. moves its upper Jaw) it is eaſily apparent that that only can ſuffer a Luxation. The which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is not eaſily luxated, by reaſon of the moſt ſtraight coarticulation of it with the bones of the head, and the exceeding ſtrength of the Muſcles that draw it upwards; but into what part the Mandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may be luxated, its ſtructure and inſertion do plainly teach us: For as concerning its ſtructure, it hath two proceſſes in its hinder part on each ſide; the former of which drawn forward being broad and thin ends as it were in a point; but the latter is carried backwards and makes a long and tranſverſe head; that is inſerted into the <hi>Os Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,</hi> but this is fitted to the ſecond boſom ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Temple bone.</p>
                  <div type="differences">
                     <head>The Differences.</head>
                     <p>From which it doth manifeſtly appear that the lower Mandible cannot be luxated to the hinder part, becauſe the Teat-like proceſſes of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bone do hinder it; not to the right (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thoſe of ripe age) becauſe the left head of the Jaw hinders; not to the left, becauſe the head of the Jaw in the right ſide hinders that. In thoſe of ripe age I ſaid, for 'tis wel known by Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that the lower Mandible in Infants is cleft, and in the midſt of the Chin is joyned with a great deal of Cartilage; which Cartilage if it be relaxt by a flux of humors, or the Chin be ſtruck, that the bone be ſeparated from the Cartilage, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Jaw may be luxated to the right or left ſide, the which yet ſeldom happens, and therefore is not conſidered. But in the riper aged becauſe that Cartilage hath ſo degenerated into a bony na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it can by no means be ſeparated, no not by boyling, nay not the leaſt footſtep almoſt remains of a line, or any ſeam, but it appears one continued bone, Phyſitians do rightly affirm that the luxation can be made only to the fore part. But this Luxation happens, if the former and ſharp proceſs, like to a Beak, which by the Greeks is called <hi>Corone,</hi> do ſlide forth below the <hi>Os jugale,</hi> that it becomes ſo much lower then it, that it can no more return upwards again into its place; for otherwiſe though this proceſs be let lower then the <hi>Os jugale,</hi> yet there is not preſently a Luxation made, but the mouth being ſhut it returns into its place again; but this Luxation is made either in one ſide only, when only its right or left part ſlips forth; or in both ſides together, when the whol bone of the lower jaw on both ſides is fallen out of its ſeat.</p>

                     <p>But the moſt common Cauſe of this Luxation, nay almoſt the only Cauſe, is the too much open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gaping of the mouth, whether it be by yawning, or by taking ſome heavy burden in the Teeth, and lifting it on high, ſo that the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med proceſs becomes lower than the <hi>Os Jugale,</hi> as was ſaid, and withal be turned aſide; for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into its ſeat is not prohibited unleſs it be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſide. Yet this very thing happens ſeldom and hardly, and the Jaw is ſeldom luxated, by reaſon of the ſtrength of the Muſcles by which 'tis tied to the upward parts. For from both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the lower jaw ariſe Nervous and moſt ſtrong Tendons, with which the Muſcles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped which are called <hi>Crotaphitae</hi> and <hi>Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teres.</hi>

For if the proceſs reſembling a beak fal out of the <hi>Os Jugale</hi> it muſt needs be that there alſo it hang forth, which in a man not very fat is eaſily known both by ſight and touch. The mouth remains open, whence the ſpeech is hindred, and the ſpittle flows forth involuntarily.</p>
                     <p>If the jaw be luxated on one part, that with the chin is inclined to the contrary part which is not luxated; the mouth is diſtorted, whence the Teeth cannot be joyned, neither do they anſwer to their equals, but the dog-teeth are under the Cutters. In the luxated part there is perceived only a certain bunching out, and the temporal Muſcle appears ſtiff. But if the jaw be luxated on both ſides, al of it with the chin hangs forth, and that ſtraight out towards the fore part or to the Breaſt; the lower Teeth go further out than the upper, yet they anſwer one to another, the Cutters to Cutters, the Dog-teeth to Dog-teeth; neer the Cheeks on both ſides there appears a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eminency, which the acute beak-like proceſs doth make; the temporal Muſcles, whoſe Tendons this proceſs doth receive, (yea is wholly compaſſed by them) appear ſtretcht, ſtiff, and hard.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The firſt way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a luxated ſhoulder</note>The firſt way is by bringing about the head of the ſhoulder about the neck of the ſhoulder-blade, to wit, when the Chirurgeon puts his hand moſt ſtraightly under the Arm-pit, and wheels about the ſhoulder with the other hand, that the middle joynts of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers force it into its Cavity; which way indeed wants not its danger; for by the circumvolution not only the nervous and membranous bodies, but alſo the brows of the boſom may be razed, nay the Cartilage compaſſing the boſom cannot eaſily be pulled or hurt without great dammage; yet it hath its place in children and other ſofter bodies, ſo that the Chirurgeon do exerciſe it warily.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond way is by the heel, after this manner:<note place="margin">The ſecond way</note> The Patient muſt be laid with his back on the ground, and between the hollow of the Arm-pit, the head of the ſhoulder and the ribs, a bal of a middle ſize made of Leather or ſome other matter not very ſoft muſt be fitted to it; but the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon ſitting right againſt the Patient let him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his right heel, if the right ſhoulder be luxated, or his left heel if the left, upon the bal put under the Arm-pit, and with both hands let him draw the ſhoulder downwards (when the head of it is rapt upwards by the ſtrength of the Muſcles) but with his heel let him drive the ſhoulder at once to the fore part and upwards; and at laſt let him force backwards the head of the ſhoulder into the Cavity of the blade; the which he may eaſily do, whenas the Muſcles do not only much help this motion, but oftentimes alone do wholly perfect it. Two Servants may make this way of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing eaſier, the one of which with a ſwathe or rein may draw the ſhoulder-blade upwards towards the head of the Patient, and by this means facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the motion downwards, but let him preſs with his foot the top of the ſhoulder, and ſo he wil hinder the ſhoulder-blade from following, whiles the Chirurgeon draws the ſhoulder down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but let the other hold the oppoſite ſound Arm, and by this means he ſhal hinder that the whol body do not follow upon the extenſion made by the Chirurgeon on the affected ſide. And this way becauſe it is done by a way contrary to the falling forth of the bone, and with extenſion too, is almoſt natural, ſafe, and not ſo laborious: yet becauſe it wants an impulſe, <hi>Galen</hi> thinks it recedes from a convenient manner.</p>

                  <p>THe Thigh in its lower part hath two eminent heads tending to the hinder part, with which it is inſerted into two boſoms of the leg-bone, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuperficial ones, and no waies deep, and parget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over with a ſmooth cartilage; it hath moreover in its hinder part a certain boſom, into which the bunching forth of the Leg-bone that ſtands forth betwixt its two boſoms is inſerted: but leſt that by reaſon of this looſer Articulation, which is by a <hi>Ginglymus,</hi> the Knee ſhould be ſubject to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Luxations; on the fore part the patel bone is ſet over the bone of the Thigh and Legg, and firmly joyned to them by benefit of the thick Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of the Muſcles extending the Leg; beſides on the out ſide of the greater bone ſtands the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, which at its upper part in the inner ſide hath a boſom covered with a Cartilage, by which the little ſide head is received, which ſubſiſts at the upper Appendix of the great Bone; but at its lower part, with its acute angle 'tis inſerted into the external and oblong boſom of the lower Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix of the great Bone, and makes the outward Ankle: whenas therefore here concur many Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, alſo many Luxations may happen.</p>

                     <p>This Luxation alſo happens from blows, fals, jumping, vehement running, and an uncomely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion or contraction, and diſtorſion of the Legg.</p>

                     <p>To what part the Knee is Luxated is eaſily known; for in the ſide to which the joynt is broke forth a bunching out, but a Cavity in the ſide from which it is departed is diſcoverable both by the ſight and touch: its figure is depraved, the Thigh is extended and cannot be bent, whence the motion is neceſſarily depraved, or wholly loſt.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The Knee if it be compared with the Elbow, the joynt in the Knee, by reaſon of its manner of juncture, oftener fals out, and is eaſier reduced. For the ſtructure of the Bones with which both joynts are contained is more ſtraight in the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, more looſe in the Knee; beſides, many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and many boſoms joyned to one another do every where bind up the joynting of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, but in the Knee the bunchings forth of the Thigh are caſt into the ſmal Boſoms of the Leg.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the ſame cauſe a Luxation of the knee is leſs dangerous, nor doth an Inflammation eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happen; for whenas an Inflammation ariſeth from the force with which the bones are expelled and reduced again, and the pain ariſing from hence, becauſe in the Knee the joynt may fal forth and

                     <p>The Knee luxated to the inward and outward part is not hard to be reſtored by moderate exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made, either with the hands in a new Luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and childs body, or with reins in a Luxation not ſo late, and ſtronger bodies; and with forcing the bones with the hand into the contrary part from which they ſel.</p>
                     <p>But a Luxation made backwards is commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reſtored, if the Patient be placed with his Face on a Bench, and ſome ſervant put a Linen Globe into the hollow of the Ham at what part the Bone ſticks forth, and ſtrongly force the bone fallen forth towards the fore parts; but let the Chirurgeon take hold of the lame Leg with both hands, and of a ſudden ſo bend and bow it that his Heel touch his Buttocks.</p>
                     <p>A Knee Subluxated by none or very little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion made, and forcing it to the contrary part is reduced into its place.</p>
                     <p>When the Bone is reduced, which is known by the free exten ſion of the Leg, and comparing it with the other Knee, convenient Medicines muſt be laid upon it, and binding up muſt be ordered, and the Patient muſt forbear going til there be no more fear of a new Luxation.</p>
